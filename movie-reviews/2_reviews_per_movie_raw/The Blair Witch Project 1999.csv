"Lloyd-23","Null","321","454","3 November 1999"," Tense, unsettling, original, intelligent, short, cheap.
","This film is not a feature film.  For a start, it is not feature length, also, it is not shot on film.  More importantly, it does not have what feature films have these days: star actors, special effects, exotic locations, explosions.  Instead, seeing B.W.P. is seeing something else that a cinema can be: a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget.  I would be glad of its success if only for that reason.<br/><br/>The first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow. In fact, it is very deft, and very efficient at what it does.  It tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation, and nothing more.  Also, it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film's format: alternating between black and white (very grainy and poorly focussed) film, and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video.  The film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made.  Three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary, with borrowed equipment, and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it.   They cannot carry tripods, steadicams, dollies, large lighting rigs, or the like, so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight, or by a single light fixed to the camera, which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens.  The film creates its own excuse to be cheap.  This is intelligent.<br/><br/>The acting and script are both excellent.  The well-cast actors are presumably playing pretty-much themselves, and are convincingly naturalistic, and neither too likeable or too dislikeable.  The slow route into hysteria is well documented.  Rather than simply having a character say ""We're lost!"", we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost, and more annoyed with each other for this.  By the time they are thoroughly lost, the audience shares the despair.<br/><br/>My friend and I, after seeing it, both felt a little sick.  I put this down to my having been tense for a hour, he put it down more to motion sickness. The jerky, badly-framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach, but I applaud the director for its uncompromising use.  Similarly, no compromise is made with the dialogue.  Some of it is very quiet and must be listened for, some is technical jargon, which is left realisticly unexplained.<br/><br/>One of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing.  It is good in that it does much to heighten the tension, with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort.  Each time the characters find something nasty, the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene, and the fact that he doesn't adds to the sense of being trapped, as the characters are.  The problem with this, though, is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor.  In truth, of course, the film is edited to create these effects, and to entertain, but the film's rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film's original creator.  Why, then, would an editor piecing together such footage, edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity?  Why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage, when neither shows any more information than the other?<br/><br/>The film is stark.  After one simple caption at the start, all that follows is the ""rushes"".  I wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited. A programme was made for television which did this.  Perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film, making it more complete, and more believable (and proper feature length).<br/><br/>While I applaud the fact that young original film-makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea, well-handled.  I dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come.<br/><br/>Most horror films these days are created not for the audience, but for the makers.  The departments of special effects, make-up, model-making, animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do.  The result is that nothing is left for the audience to do, since everything can be seen and heard, and the viewer's imagination can be switched off.  Today, it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen, and so film-makers show off and show us a formation of Tamworths, which is something which will look impressive in the trailer.  To show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps.  This way, we create our own terrors, perfectly fitted to ourselves.  The ghastly face I see in my head, is the ghastly head which I find scary.  The ghastly face I am shown may be one I can cope with quite easily.  If I see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something I cannot see, my own brain creates demons for my night's dreams, demons far more mighty than anything CGI graphics or a latex mask could portray.<br/><br/>This film will stay in your thoughts for some while."

","I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one darn good movie.<br/><br/>Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length, its amateurish photography/editing, and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First, the film has to be at most ninety minutes long: any more, and it would be too long and boring. Second, the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods, listening to the rippling water of the creek, snapping branches under their boots, and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras (one black-and-white, the other color) to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly, the incessant screaming of whiny Heather, the constant complaining of average-joe Mike, and the Dudley-Do-Rightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes, these are regular people and up-and-coming actors from your local community theater, but YOU KNOW THEM. You've met people like them.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint, however, comes from the film's supposed ""lack"" of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" and though not as gory and as shocking as that film, ""The Blair Witch Project"" shows just enough fright in the group's search for a way out of the woods, stalked by people and/or things they may never understand. In the older film, the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long; it is even longer here, but the suspense/fright (just as in the older film) begins right from the opening credits: you just don't see it until the film's over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders--these are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real, her cries are genuine, and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.<br/><br/>I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike, then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them, but we're glued to the screen, intent to know what actually happens.<br/><br/>The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend, but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don't listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews, which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way, are like movie reviews: the critics tell you what they saw, but mostly they don't want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.<br/><br/>And that's what I'll do. I won't ruin it for you. 8/10."

","I think I know why Blair Witch has generated as much negative as positive responses.  It FORCES YOU TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE!<br/><br/>Wow.  What a concept.  Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved.  Take a leap of faith/belief or whatever and delve into this movie.  Without the overpowering F/X and music score most movies rely on to 'scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.  The hardest thing in movies is to scare you.  Not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound blasting at 400 decibels (ever seen the 1999 version of the Haunting?  Event Horizon? - every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the Blast).  Wake up people!  Blair Witch is the horror movies we have been needing for a long time and I'm glad someone finally had the guts to make it."
"steves97","8","133","198","21 June 2000"," Loved it, but you might hate it
","Like most movies, whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they're looking for.  Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects, gore, shocks, and, in some cases, the high production value.  Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make, can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time?  I honestly don't think so.<br/><br/>Myrick and Sanchez had a terrific idea for a film: make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students.  Some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch, when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students.  I feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script, only then could they deal with Heather, Josh, and Mike.  Until they do that, the film would never work for them.<br/><br/>I just put myself in their position:  I'm lost in the woods, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I've got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment.  The weather is getting colder, it rains just enough to make life miserable, and something is waking me up each and every night.  Now, I'm exhausted, grouchy, scared, and I having troubles thinking clearly.<br/><br/>People might have hated Heather because they she was bitchy and annoying, but all three of them had their moments, good and bad. Many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them, and that they never got to see the Blair Witch.  Many other people may have resented Artisan Entertainment's marketing campaign, although they can't deny just how effective it was.  All the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended; without it, they knew the film couldn't work for anybody.<br/><br/>As you might already tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  What Haxan Films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary, but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere.  I found the backstory interesting, the plotline well thought out, and the characters extremely developed, considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film. If you do decide to see this film, I think you'll enjoy it if you see it for what it simply is, nothing more; it might even scare the hell out of you!"
"robert-121","10","259","420","3 July 1999"," Gripping, stunning film, the absolute thriller!!
","Privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film, I found myself actually feeling the pain and mind-numbing anguish of the characters. At times in the movie, I would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them, fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there.  I think that is the most effective aspect of this, the fear of the unknown.  I really can't think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity, and so you don't know how to relate or react, and you are forced to suffer through the unknown.  A key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first-hand.  You watch as the characters are broken down to small, scared, hunted animals, and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become, yet you don't feel sorry for them, only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives.  Wonderfully created film that, at least for me, an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods, will always haunt me to the core of my soul when I look around and see nothing but endless woods, unknown sounds, and things that are never seen."
"zombie65","10","183","297","19 July 1999"," Inventive and terrifying. Will spawn many imitations.
","With all the hype surrounding this new independent horror film, you might think it would be hard for it to live up to expectations. The Blair Witch Project is probably as scary as it's reputation. Feel free to read on, I do not intend to give away any of the film's secrets or surprises. The less you know about this creepy little chiller, the better.<br/><br/>Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no DNA altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking.<br/><br/>If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp, the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That's unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure, you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn't that how it usually goes?"
"great_sphinx_42","9","86","136","1 May 2001"," An Experiment In Fear
","Hmm. Wow. What is there left to say? I've waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to IMDB, and here they are:<br/><br/>This is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people. Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread, and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe, drivel, awful, wretched, the worst ever, etc. (NOTE: as far as I'm concerned, the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best- or even more especially, the worst- movie ever are to be immediately disregarded.) Highly innovative in its way, it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort-of sequel. In the summer of Star Wars: Episode 1, this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.<br/><br/>
I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house, I felt for the first and last time in my adult life *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger.<br/><br/>Many have complained about the shaky-cam, the cussing, how nothing 'really happens', and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not *that* shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why- they're tromping through the woods and they're scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing- the lines were ad-libbed, the actors are college-age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student I've ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples' language, but what else is new? That's not a flaw of the movie- it's realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.<br/><br/>I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary, but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts: a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that's it.<br/><br/>TBWP is about what you *can't see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.<br/><br/>
Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland, just beyond the flashlight's reach, something is making strange and terrible noises- but we don't know what it is."

","I've never seen the tide turn on movie reviews before like I did in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. First, I heard this movie was the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST, then I heard it was the worst movie of the year. When people thought it might be real, they loved it. Then, when everyone found out it was fake, I heard all sorts of bad things about it.<br/><br/>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Josh Leonard (actors with same names as their characters), go out into the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland to do a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch. They are never found, but a year later their footage is discovered, and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers.<br/><br/>I did not find THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT especially scary, although it was rather spooky. I did think it was good, with an excellent and very original plot. The acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good, especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true. The character development was well done, and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters.<br/><br/>Was this movie overhyped? A little, but I think if it wasn't that it wouldn't have been as successful, since the actors, writers and directors are relatively unknown. They did a very good job and I hope to see more works from them in the near future.<br/><br/>Sure, some of the realism could've been better. Even I knew that they should've followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest. And if this was happening to me, I doubt I'd pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell. But it still worked. I think the scariest part is how you don't see as much as you hear, because often the sound is 10 times worse than the thing making the sound.<br/><br/>This movie isn't too scary, but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone, it will successfully freak you out. It's worth a rent or a buy, judge for yourself."
"Chasuk","1","128","215","16 February 2001"," Most Over-hyped Movie I've Ever Seen
","I've seen worse movies, but not many.  Yes, I like horror films.  Yes, I can distinguish cheap, sensationalistic splatter-horror from from the more chilling, show-less-and-frighten-more variety (and I prefer the latter to the former).<br/><br/>I still hated Blair Witch.  I don't lack imagination, but this movie certainly did.  I've seen Tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear.  The film lacked wit, style, story, plot, suspense, or verve.  I don't need expensive cinematography or stellar acting, but a film does need something to redeem itself (other than a sophomoric, if marginally clever, idea), and this film did not have it.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema.  For a real horror masterpiece, see Ringu (The Ring), which, though it was probably filmed on a larger budget, worked because of talented direction and great storyline."
"Roo1i1","Null","122","206","2 February 2000"," Haven't you ever been to camp?
","This movie scared me in a way that no other has done before.  I remember going to camp as a child, and hearing things outside at night.  That was scary enough.  This movie recreated that entire scenario and then added some to it.  The fact that those things that go bump in the night outside your campsite were REAL in this movie makes it more nerve-inducing and frightening.  As anyone, the first time I set foot in the ocean after seeing JAWS for the first time, I was nervous.  Let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house, I have to drive through the woods. After seeing this movie, that drive got SIGNIFICANTLY longer, more eerie, and scared the heck out of me.  I went about 90 mph all the way home in order to get out of the woods!  This is one SCARY movie."

","If you are looking for something to scare you, look somewhere else, this is the worst excuse I have seen for a horror film. The style of shooting was as expected, shaky hand held camera, which fitted the premise of the film, but you felt like you were watching an amateur film by school kids rather than actual footage of a real event which it was supposed to depict.<br/><br/>Normally I expect a horror to get my heart racing a few times, and have some surprises, but the plot was too obvious, there were no surprises, nothing that would make you jump.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to any film buff, ignore the hype and skip this film."

If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot.

I can't believe it made the amount of money it did.  I should have demanded a refund.  Let's put it this way -- if I took a few of my friends into the woods, with a video camera, and made scary noises at them so that they could pretend to scream, it would undoubtedly be scarier and superior to this movie.

","I'd confidently say that this film has got to be one of the biggest movie-swindles ever perpetrated on a completely unsuspecting audience.<br/><br/>With a devilishly clever publicity campaign to fuel its release, The Blair Witch Project (TBWP, for short) became the 2nd most successful ""indie"" film of all time, grossing nearly $250 million. Its success was surpassed in 2002 by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.<br/><br/>Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, TBWP is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage and filmed in real time. TBWP was shot in a matter of just 8 days and all of the dialogue was, pretty much, improvised.<br/><br/>TBWP tells the tale of 3 young Film Students who hike out into the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend known as The Blair Witch.<br/><br/>The viewer is told that these 3 students were never found, although their video and sound equipment (along with the footage they shot) was discovered a year later.<br/><br/>In my opinion, TBWP completely fails to deliver on all counts.<br/><br/>*Trivia Note* - Throughout the course of the story the word ""Fukk"" was spoken 154 times.

","A film which fell foul of its own publicity machine, `The Blair Witch Project' was abhorred and derided by the mainstream film-going public which it became unfortunately directed at due to its extraordinary and outlandish marketing campaign. `The Blair Witch Project' is not a typical film that the typical cinema-going public would normally be exposed to. The camera-work is jerky, the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non-existent. At times confusing, annoying, irritating and tedious, this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film-making. This movie is virtually all style-there's hardly any plot, no real action, no semblance of a real script-and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film. Indeed, only the very last image in the film is truly frightening, and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning. The rest of it only becomes scary afterwards, when the audience has had time to consider what they've seen. It is groundbreaking, manipulative cinema made without a script, with an amateur cast and with little or no post-production values. This is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated, if the accompanying hype is overlooked, as a unique, avant-garde art film and not the regular Hollywood stock it was presented as to the public."

Movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear. I understand the premise, of course. Make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences. The problem is, most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever. Whenever there was a hint of tension, the actor would swear or scream, for lack of anything better they could think of.

","CONTAINS SPOILERS In Berkeley, The Blair Witch Project generated a lot of a certain type of buzz that will often make me wary and I avoided seeing it during its first run, suspecting that I'd feel the rip of an eight-dollar ticket. After having screened a VHS copy acquired at Yard Sale Videos, I still feel that way a little but not because I didn't like it. Seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way I prefer to do.<br/><br/>I had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film's setup. The self-filmed documentary approach can't quite carry the movie's weight through its entire length. Some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists, as was the implication, yet there they were. No one among the three `film makers' could have managed the presence of mind, in the midst deep panic, to have filmed Heather running screaming through the dark woods. It was all too far out of pre-established character, although the image is certainly indelible. But even a Dodge Dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations, I was forced to admit that The Blair Witch Project is.very effective.<br/><br/>There are moments when Blair Witch has the dankness of Silence of The Lambs and the raw, twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of Night of the Living Dead, in my opinion one of the great horror sequences. I became a true believer at the point where Josh and Mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling Burkittsville woods, that they really had to get out, and were ramping up to full freak while Heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film. This sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless know-it-all, especially when said person is female and, thereby, largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males. Josh and Mike, aggravated and frightened as they were, still could not abandon Heather, who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset. Both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squat-less and being unable to admit it.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project has an unassuming, almost sneaky way of getting to you. First off, the main characters are not at all likeable, which in itself is fatiguing. Josh and Mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any Saturday night, marooned in a mall or mini-mart parking lot. Heather is an almost-cute, soon-to-be-overweight, classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor, or of the ironic. A few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night, freed from the shackles of Daylight Savings Time, comes too soon and remains too long. When the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags, you're right with them. Then, you're suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons. The sound of fracturing wood, out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough, are not just twigs being snapped. They're branches, big ones. But this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio. One of the three refers to the sound as `footsteps' but only if the feet are size-72 American. It's left up to us to fully grasp the implications.<br/><br/>The three principal actors are, essentially, playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous. But playing one's self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction, most notably the tough-minded, endlessly irritating Heather. Her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end, you know the doo-doo has gotten very deep. It's not mere post-adolescent, cheeseburger-craving discomfort any longer. That trifle has been left far behind; somewhere back under the decaying leaves. Heather's runny-nosed, video self-portrait, made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far, far over their heads, is truly poignant. We may enjoy seeing vain, clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the Blair Witch trio; three somewhat loosely-wrapped goofballs trying to pull off a film-making project, are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid. They've just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time.<br/><br/>And finally the ending, which is really what this film is all about. Almost everything you ever feared in your youth, both in the light of day and dark of night, is compressed perfectly into the film's last few seconds. When the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam, the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced. All exploding skulls, bursting rib cages, and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple, implicit power. Only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement, in Psycho, even comes close. Keep the little ones away from this one, Mom and Dad. A child's mind will have no defense, nowhere to run, and most disturbing, nothing tangible to run from; only an invisible, meticulously goal-oriented malevolence that comes from nowhere, and everywhere, at once."

","If you thought that ""Star Wars Episode 1"" was the most over-hyped letdown of the year, get ready.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother's friends on their first camping trip this summer.  Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), ""Blair Witch"" should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone.  Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, ""Blair Witch"" is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at.  It's basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing.  This is the movie that puts the 'horror' in horrible.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" is supposed to be about the making of a documentary.  Is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew? A girl who is a complete bitch, and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of Beavis and Butt-head. The interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff. Do stick figures made of wood, and the sounds of nearby ""filmmakers"" making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps?...if so, you might actually find this frightening.<br/><br/>Well, as audiences everywhere are finding out (as Cinemascore is indicating), ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a good film, and certainly not what they were told it would be.  Shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began.  Jeez, even ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" was scarier than ""Blair Witch"" (if Jennifer Love's breasts get any bigger...) Any dolt can do what the makers of ""Blair Witch"" have done, just look at the worst home videos your neighbor Larry has in his collection (but Larry knows how to use that tripod his wife bought him last Xmas).<br/><br/>To quote Bart Simpson from that great Halloween episode with Poe's ""The Raven""; ""Do you know what would have been scarier than nothing?.....................ANYTHING!!"""

"TheFinalAlias","1","99","188","20 April 2009"," If only negative ratings were possible.....
","As anyone who has read my reviews for any length of time knows, I don't kiss ass when it comes to independent films. If it's a good film; I rate it accordingly, if it's a bad film; I do likewise. <br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>It's become one of my pet peeves that indie film fans demand that EVERY independent film be called nothing short of a masterpiece no matter how mundane it is, no compromise. It's this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers. Honestly; just because something was made without studio assistance and/or interference DOES NOT automatically make it a masterpiece, any more than having the hot new centerfold of-the-month makes the next Michael Bay film an Oscar contender. Yet, still the indie zombies insist that it does, supposedly this mentality comes from resenting Hollywood's excesses, such as taking away artistic control, bloated budgets, inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones, and worst of all; annoying marketing campaigns. What BS.<br/><br/>Indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies; but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest; as endless marketing hype(along with pure stupidity)is the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker I'm currently reviewing.<br/><br/>I can recall, quite vividly; the endless pop-up ads, the fan sites; official and(supposedly)unofficial, magazine articles, TV. specials, the merchandise, the relentless TV. commercials. Whew. The people who complain about the 'Dark Knight's marketing campaign just plain weren't ALIVE to not know the extent of this films marketing(which makes sense; since 99.9% of all the negative TDK reviews I've seen couldn't have been written by someone older than 5 or 8). TDK had NOTHING on this film's relentless marketing campaign.<br/><br/>Trashing Hollywood for over hyping their products, then doing the same: that's the definition of hypocrisy. That alone would be justification enough to dislike TBWP and it's indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a 1 rating, even if it was a good movie, even if I had liked it.<br/><br/>The fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating.<br/><br/>The common defense is that this is some brilliant 'art-film' which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination. BS. Val Lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the '40's, with films which are classics of the genre: 'Cat People', 'The Seventh Victim'. etc. and in 1963; probably the best of all 'unseen' horror films; Robert Wise(a disciple of Lewton)'s 'The Haunting' was released; to borrow an indie film fan phrase: it PWNED 'Blair Witch'. All classics, all achieving their suspense without showing the monster. All before this film.<br/><br/>But indie fans ignore all this; they claim those movies don't count because they are old and in black & white. Typical response from them, no respect for older film.<br/><br/>As for the 'story' of this film and it's qualities; I wouldn't even give it a D if it was a student film. The device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumb-asses running around and passing it off as a film. I'll admit it's clever, heck, even Lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity, but he did it mostly because he recognized it's dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives. For the record, it is also a complete and utter rip-off of a much better film called 'The Last Broadcast', the difference being that there is a survivor. Really, otherwise it's the same damn thing, and it's the indie film fans who call Hollywood unoriginal(If only I could use the eye-roll emoticon).<br/><br/>The story also sucks, 'Cannibal Holocaust' did the 'found footage' thing much better. The 'acting' is also awful; it's so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story. The praise for characterization is true, though. I definitely felt something about the characters: I wanted all 3 of them dead within a minute. And even if, pray tell, the device of not showing the monster WAS original, or had been used well; does it REALLY matter if it's an awful film otherwise? Nope. At best, it just revives a long-dead gimmick.<br/><br/>And for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real, let me ask you something: Have you ever heard the phrase 'Idiots will believe anything'? Grow up and watch some atmospheric, 'unseen' horror films that are actually good. This is no different than your usual incredibly stupid, vapid Hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims, only without a slasher and not made by Hollywood, but still incredibly stupid , vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims.~"
"Don-102","8","78","146","25 October 1999"," Cinema Verite Fright...
","Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi-media event?  It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.<br/><br/>A guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has ""Heather, Mike, and Josh"" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.<br/><br/>Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.<br/><br/>True, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.<br/><br/>Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2"

","*** This comment contains spoilers *** <br/><br/>As a fan of movies and horror films for 45 years, I've seen a lot, and I have to say that BWP is a totally amateurish piece of junk.<br/><br/>To call this a ""film"" is laughable. It has no plot, no ending, no story. It is the 90 minute rambling of some dunderhead carrying around a hand held camera filming everything he sees. This movie was made by loading some film, getting some nobodies together, going to the woods and shooting enough film to make up 90 minutes. No film was left on the cutting room floor. Every worthless scrap was included. The ineptitude and total lack of film-making skills is astounding. I used to think Robot Monster was the pits; BWP is worse.<br/><br/>Here is what happens in the ""film"". Three dimwits find a tape made by three nitwits who supposedly uncovered the Blair witch and were never seen again. The three dimwits head into the forest to investigate. Along the way they hear weird noises at night, find some sticks hanging from trees, get lost in the forest, start to cry because they are so scared. In the end one of the dimwits wanders into an abandoned shack and the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera. THE END. That's all folks. I'm not kidding. That's the movie.<br/><br/>In these times when anyone has access to equipment to make a movie, BWP proves the theory that any talent less person can make a ""film."" BWP was the biggest movie marketing SCAM in history. It proves P.T. Barnum's ""There's a sucker born every minute."" By using the internet to lie and hype the film, the cynical lug heads who made this suckered people in. As they say in the used car business, ""For every seat, there's an ass."" I was one of the asses who got suckered. Using the same ""based on a true story"" technique as The Amityville Horror, BWP lured well-intentioned moviegoers into the theater. If BWP were a car then it would be subject to a ""lemon law"" and you could get your money back. Unfortunately, the movie business doesn't work that way. Those of us who lost our $$ on this scam have no recourse. The only recourse I have is to slam this piece of trash in this review, which I hope I have done. Why I detest BWP so much is because it was such a shameless scam that showed utter contempt for movie goers. This was not a film; it was just a mechanism to cheat people out of their money.<br/><br/>I would rather watch Robot Monster ten times than ever see BWP again."

","It is to the ""Blair Witch"" filmmakers' (and I am talking about Myrick and Sanchez, not Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) great credit that for the most part, they get away with the central conceit that three tired, hungry, lost, and above all, frightened-out-of-their-minds documentarians would still keep rolling footage under the dire circumstances in which they find themselves -- for that is one of the movie's only shortcomings (even though the majority of the audience won't notice or won't mind).  The Project's plus column, however, is far longer than the minus one, as the very fabric of the improvisational techniques employed holds together an authenticity virtually guaranteed to send shivers down the backs of all but the most road-hardened horror vets.  The interplay among Donahue, Leonard, and Williams is refreshingly funny in the early stages, which only ratchets up the intensity when doom seems to be knocking (or howling or scratching or leaving creepy tokens outside the campers' tent).  The Blair Witch Project has all of the necessary sequences to assure its cult status (I love the stick figures) and the mysterious, dread-filled ending will most certainly set fans arguing -- once they catch their breath."

They have gone out walking in an area of woods that they don't know and not a one of them can even read a map.

"basilisksamuk","1","37","71","3 March 2013"," Fear of twigs and string
","1 THE SCAM Apparently there is a very scary film called ""The Blair Witch Project"". It is famous for the fact that, although it was made very cheaply using hand held video cameras and the like, it is really, really scary. In fact so scary that it is best to make sure you are wearing your brown trousers before entering the cinema. I thought I was going to see this film but my local cinema tricked me by showing a crap film of the same name which was so badly made that no one else would have been fooled by it. Also it was clearly a fake version as it had zero scares in it. In fact it wasn't a horror film at all but a very bad film made by art students mistaking noise for art who couldn't scare my cat, Xena, who is frightened of anything containing atoms.<br/><br/>2 MY THEORY Urban youth in western countries no longer have any initiation rites or rites of passage. Very few of them even go camping anymore and most of them have little experience with things found in the natural world e.g. trees, leaves. Therefore the very idea of spending a night out in the woods fills them with existential dread and they find it easy to identify with the very unpleasant and very whiney stars of this film. Like the characters in the film they are terrified by the sight of a few twigs held together with bits of string or small mounds of rocks. It's sad I know but what other explanation could there be for fear engendered in some viewers of this film? For anyone who has ever spent a night out in the woods it will forever be a mystery why anyone should be prone to fear of twigs and rocks. All we can hope to do is reach out our hearts to those poor young folk living in daily dread of post traumatic twig disorder after seeing this film.<br/><br/>3 THE ART OF THE UNSEEN I've always thought that The Haunting (original B&W Robert Wise version) to be the scariest film of all time and will brook no argument. In the proper version of The Haunting the viewer never sees what the horrible thing(s) are that hang out in Hill House but nevertheless the lack of gore and the feverish workings of the viewer's imagination supplied all that was necessary to scare the s**t out of said viewer. Presumably the makers of Blair Witch had the same idea. They failed. Miserably.<br/><br/>4 THE ART OF NOISE Another superb feature of The Haunting was the dramatic use of sound to create a feeling of overwhelming terror. Had the Blair Witch makers attempted to engineer the soundtrack and sound effects more professionally I believe they could have turned a deeply s**t movie into one that was at least acceptably a bit prone to cause viewers to worry, a little. They didn't. Instead they opted for making the potentially scary noises inaudible and cranked up the sound of twigs rubbing together until they overpowered everything else on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>5 HOW TO COPE WITH SEEING THIS FILM You may or may not be familiar with my dictum that all modern films would benefit from having half an hour cut from their running length. In the case of Blair Witch the film would benefit from having about 75 minutes cut out of its approximately 90 minute running time. In fact, if you are unwise enough to see the entire film you will come out of the cinema convinced that the film ran for at least 17 or 18 hours. In the interests of sanity I advise you to watch until you get to the end of the vox pop scenes and then head smartly for the nearest bar. Have a few good stiff drinks and return to the auditorium to see the last five minutes of the film. This features scenes inside an old house which are accidentally quite good. Then go home and hug a twig."
"manalone923","1","41","80","1 December 2003"," The biggest marketing scam in movie history. Only people who get scared by OTHER people being scared will like this crap.
","This was a marketing scam that worked... plain and simple. And if you allow me the lengthy explanation, I hope you'll see legitamite reasons why I think it is an utter waste of time. If you don't want to read and either love BWP or instead want something that doesn't suck, go watch ""The Last Broadcast"". It's similar, came first, is better acted, and has an actual ending that makes sense.<br/><br/>The BWP began with a huge ad campaign, in the form of allegedly ""true"" documents and paranoia propaganda that took major advantage of the internet community. It got people out in droves to see what this thing really was. And what it was was an hour and a half of kids with a camera, walking in circles through the woods, working themselves into a paranoid frenzy while building to a climax (spoiler next) that literally delivers nothing.<br/><br/>(Spoiler end.) The premise, and what the online campaign hinted as being true, is this: A small town legend, the Blair Witch, is terrorizing a town and abducting children. Three stupid teens go into the woods armed with a camera and try to film / find evidence of this, and are never heard from again. Their videotape surfaces, and what is on it is mysterious.<br/><br/>Now here's the literal truth of what happened: The two creators of this ""film"" built a long, slow consumer awareness program by leaking supposedly legitamite details of the Blair Witch incidents, like fictitous police reports and interviews. Over several months, people were hearing about the Blair Witch case with the overwhelming sense that it was all real. Then the ""film"" was released in theaters and included what was supposedly the non-fiction video documentary of three kids who disappeared while looking in those woods. The lines of fantasy and reality had been effectively blurred, and people came out in droves to see what was really going on.<br/><br/>
Seeing as how the actors in the ""film"" were on Jay Leno that very weekend, I was readily aware that it wasn't real. But I went anyway, out of curiosity. I thoroughly, thoroughly despised what I saw. I didn't have high hopes, since I hadn't yet read the much more entertaining web site stuff. But I was so angry that at the end of the ""film"", I loudly said ""Bulls***! I want my 7 bucks back!"" And was met with rousing applause, and yes, a few boos.<br/><br/>I'm a patient man, and very tolerant. I've seen subtitled, three hour long black and white foreign films. Ever heard of the 50 hour ""Three Kingdoms"" chinese hitorical series? Yeah, I sat through that. I liked Titanic. And I've seen horror movies including Dawn of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, the Sixth Sense, Nosferatu, the black and white Frankenstein and Draculas, and even comparably modern junk like the Scream trilogy. And aside from Scream 3, I loved all of it. But with the Blair Witch Project, I was simply offended. I fell victim to a marketing scam, and the fact that some people still call it genius burns me to this day.<br/><br/>This is why. The ""movie"", viewed as itself, is utter garbage. For the fans out there, what are you gauging the movie by? The acting? The plot? The PACING!? Three kids whine, nitpick, argue, and cry throughout the vast majority of it all. There's a scene when the most annoying character, the woman (she's that hideous nose / eye creature you see on the box and probably think is the Blair Witch) breaks down in hysterical, overacted tears simply because the team has made a circle and is crossing the same log they've already crossed. And if you don't mind, here's a spoiler so be prepared: There is no Blair Witch. You see nothing on camera. You hear some noises, see strange clues like wooden sticks. And at the end, during a scene that should have been halfway through the ""movie"", you see a creepy house with some blood on it. Then the movie ends. Period. I do not exagerrate. And I don't HAVE to see something to enjoy it. Jeez, 1997's ""Contact"" was great, for example. But when you build up a movie like this, can you not put SOMETHING up there to qualify my time?<br/><br/>(spoiler done) But you see, we're supposed to buy all that because it's a masterful example of anticipation, suspense, and power of suggestion over visuals, harkening back to the old days when stuff didn't have to be flashy and obvious to be frightening. Well, no, sorry. There is nothing frightening about kids in a tent, crying and shivering, and saying they've heard things. (Poss. Spoiler:) It's a ghost story with no payoff. They, and we, see and hear nothing to suggest anything more horrible than common woodland noises at night. (Spoiler end) The kids work themselves up like schoolchildren and start freaking out so badly that they frighten themselves beyond belief, at nothing. That isn't scary, suspenseful, or playing on my natural fears. If I got afraid just because I saw other people terrified of whatever it was that they were imagining, I would have been a basket case in grade school. And even if scared people WERE enough to scare me, it's still a wash because the majority of the ""movie"" takes place in the daytime, where nothing of importance happens. I go on vacations to other countries and tape less daytime commonalities than these idiots. And Yeah, if a ten minute argument over someone losing the map is scary, then I guess I've just been spoiled by GOOD films like Psycho and The Thing.<br/><br/>And these kids are just horrible to begin with. They're the most annoying bunch I've ever heard, and I was hoping halfway through that the girl would just die to move the plot. But instead, we get lots of arguing, lots of wandering, lots of hysteria, and a few hints of plot like finding an unidentified bloody cloth one morning.<br/><br/>Here, in its simplicity, is why this ""movie"" does not deliver. 1: If it's viewed on its own, without external knowledge of promotional material, the movie is baseless, without support, and with no closure or explanation. Without background information it's a pointless mess, so we must judge it by the material that got us interested in the first place- and that material was far more interesting. 2: If viewed as REAL, one must ignore the fact that it's well known as one of the most fiercely debated and famous films ever. But since the hook was that it might BE real, it's a waste. 3: If one watches it as a MOVIE to be entertained by, it's a dud due to horrible and annoying performances, no pacing or twists, and worst of all, no payoff. It winds up being an amateur film without music, lighting, or a good script.<br/><br/>All I can say is that the fake case history that the creators came up with to sell this crap WAS intruiging, and was more interesting than the ""film"" by leaps and bounds. My cousin struggled to defend his like of the ""movie"" until finally deciding on a reason that satisfied him, and became the only explanation I could possibly buy: That Blair Witch was worth watching simply as a side bonus to the crafted material that he was more interested in. I don't want to insult the people who did like the ""film"", but if you did, that must mean it scared you. Well once you get over the fear, I ask you to watch it again a few times. WHAT scared you? What mood were you in, to where you were actually frightened? Was it simply not knowing what the kids would find? (Spoiler alert) Well now that you know you never see the supposed Witch or anything that is NOT possibly manmade, is it still scary? (Spoiler over).  I wasn't scared at all because I knew it was fictitous, and went anyway just to see what was supposedly so good. I was bitterly disappointed to see Blair Witch for what it was: Two guys who took advantage of the gullibility of the public, tempted them, played to their fear, and failed to deliver on a mental, intellectual, or even visual level. The only ""genius"" of the Blair Witch Project is, simply, how well it was used to scam the public. And I truly believe that the only people scared by this ""film"" are people like the kids IN it: People who are scared because it seems like they should be, without even any evidence to support the fear. Sure, you may watch the BWP thinking it'll be scary, and nervous in anticipation of what you might see. But by the end, what did you ACTUALLY see? Don't you feel cheated?<br/><br/>
Well if not, what scared you is called mass hysteria, and it worked decades ago with War of the Worlds...Which wasn't even an intentional scam. Oh yeah, it was free too."

","Somebody actually compared this to Hitchcock? I felt ill when I saw that. I actually tried very hard to go to sleep during this movie just because I thought it might seem to be over a little faster. I absolutely did not buy in to the characters. I rooted for the witch, which to her credit never showed up in the film. Good move on her part. I wish I hadn't been there either.<br/><br/>When they got to the map sequence, I actually wanted them all to die. I had absolutely no sympathy for these jerks. Yes, I know we are supposed to believe the ""witch"" caused all these things - loosing the map, walking in circles, etc. I just didn't buy it. What I did buy was a bunch of idiots went wandering around in the woods. There was no witch - these people were just too stupid to be allowed to live, and thankfully Darwinism kicked in before they polluted the gene pool further. I hope... I am absolutely serious when I say I was rooting for the witch, by the way, but she took too long.<br/><br/>I was not scared at any point during this film. I was extremely irritated. I would have killed them myself. The only good thing about this movie is that it IS only 80 minutes long - which reduces the amount of time you have to endure. I have a good imagination, and like it when a talented director lets the action happen in my head as much as on the screen. This film had no such director.<br/><br/>This film should have been left buried under the foundation of the 'Blair witch house.'

It never came.  Although the premise of the film is interesting...the film NEVER (at any point--except maybe the last two seconds of the film) lives up to its potential (you end up wondering why this movie even cost $60,000 to make).  One needs to have a lot of unmotivated imagination (or be down right gullible) to find any part of this movie scary.  The film is mostly comprised of the three characters arguing and fighting (the girl is especially annoying), them running around at night screaming (as if that's supposed to scare the viewers), sticks hanging on the trees and gathered stones, and of course the grand finale which leaves the viewers numb with utter disappointment.  Again, the premise of the movie has (or had) a lot of potential but it nowhere near lives up to its hype...It is one of the most (if not the) boring movies I've ever seen and a total waste of time and money...Our group was so bored after watching the ""Project"" that we ended up watching a video of the Matrix afterwards...A generous 1 (out of 10) for the Blair Witch Project"

","Absolutely, positively one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life.

At first I was a bit alarmed at being by myself in a dark theatre with a supposedly scary movie. I know realise the place was empty because word of mouth had already got around about what a dog this film is.<br/><br/>Far from being scared, I was BORED, BORED, BORED.

You still have to present the audience with something to engage their minds, emotions, fears, whatever. I know it was meant to be a ""faux"" documentary, but that doesn't mean you don't need characters. And a plot."
"kylopod","6","17","32","26 October 2005"," That was it?
","One time as I entered a theater the usher was handing out 3D glasses for a short demonstration before the main film. After the previews finished and we were instructed to put the glasses on, there was a brief shot of a virtual theater in 3D, then it ended! Several members of the audience, including me, said in unison, ""That was it?""<br/><br/>That more or less describes my feelings about ""The Blair Witch Project."" When it first came out in the summer of '99, a fellow told me that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen. That's what many critics had indicated as well. Since I love being scared, I eagerly went to the theater, thinking I was in for the experience of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of three college kids who do a research assignment, go on a long camping trip into the woods, and ultimately lose their way. As I watched the kids grow increasingly panicky and finally get separated, my interest began to perk...and then the movie just ended! I sat there in confusion. That was it? Where was the fear that everyone spoke about?<br/><br/>My complaint is not that the film lacked violence. On the contrary, I'm genuinely tired of the sort of horror film where explicit gore substitutes for true terror. I believe that the most effective horror movies leave a lot to the imagination. Shortly after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I saw ""The Sixth Sense,"" which scared the pants off me without containing much explicit violence. A movie does not need violence in order to be scary, and, indeed, too much violence can detract from a movie's suspense. But one thing a good horror movie absolutely must do is establish a real threat, something that ""The Blair Witch Project"" does not do.<br/><br/>In the early scenes, I was unable to make sense out of the local legends the kids were investigating. The stories that the residents tell are unconvincing and contradictory. One resident talks about seeing a ""white misty thing,"" another describes what he saw as ""an old woman whose feet never touched the ground."" This is the kind of naiveté associated with popular folklore like the Loch Ness Monster, and I could not connect any of it with the movie's later events.<br/><br/>While we are told that the kids were never found, the footage presents no clear-cut evidence that anything actually happens in the woods, other than that the kids get lost. In one scene, Heather begins screaming frantically at something she finds in a pile of leaves. I later found out that she was supposed to have seen severed human parts, but that was far from clear to me. Fans somehow piece together the various sections of the film and concoct a coherent story of supernatural murder, but to me it looked more like a case of hysteria than an encounter with a Blair Witch.<br/><br/>Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad film. As a fake documentary, it is well-made. The kids look, talk, and act like real college students. While not scary, the film is far from boring. I enjoyed watching the story progress while giving the appearance of being something spontaneous.<br/><br/>Curiously, the Razzie awards nominated both this film and Heather Donahue's performance as the worst of 1999, one of the few times I've disagreed with their selections. We tend to overlook how hard it is for actors to act like they're not acting. People who argue that Donahue's performance was over-the-top have never, I suspect, seen someone panic. There was not a moment in the film that felt wrong or fake to me. Perhaps the reason I didn't get scared is that I felt smarter than these characters, who behave in ways that I do not think I would have behaved in the same situation. But I still found their reactions plausible.<br/><br/>If I was disappointed, it was only because the hype surrounding this film gave me a certain set of expectations, which failed to solidify. This movie was an early demonstration of the power of the Internet, a cheap $20,000 production that never would have attained so much popularity if not for a website that helped propagate the legend to the public as something real. It was more than just a film: it was an act of showmanship. This all amounted to an interesting demonstration, but not the sort of film I expect will endure."

First of all, the characters are undoubtedly annoying! I didn't like them in any way. It just seemed they used the whole swearing thing to look more real, but it ended up sounding artificial and nothing more than that. Analyzing them, I noticed Heather was the more developed one, though she was the most irritating. Josh and Mike had no definite personality, they kept changing from nice guys to completely pugnacious. During the day shots, all I was hoping for was to get dark quick and perhaps feel a bit frightened. However, the scenes at tent were also boring where the listened to inaudible (for us) sounds and overreacted to pretty much everything.<br/><br/>Even though, it's not anything like a good movie (in my opinion) I still encourage you to watch and draw your own conclusions.

Three friends and I tired to see this movie on the third day of the opening weekend, but it was sold out.  So a week later, two of those same friends and I tired again. This time we made it in...with only about six other people.  I know now why there were so few people in the theater that time.  No one was going to see it a second time, and anyone who had seen it before their friends must have done the same thing I did after seeing it...if a friend told me they were going to see it, I did everything possible (short of bludgeoning them with the nearest piece of furniture) to prevent them from seeing it.<br/><br/>The home video touch was interesting, and had potential, but it just didn't come off.  The only thing it did for me, was give me the kind of headache and eye strain I get after reading several hundred pages of an engineering textbook or writing a C++ program.

Try putting yourself in their shoes.""  Well, I think I can imagine that desperate feeling they were supposed to be experiencing.  One time while backpacking in the mountains of New Mexico I ended up away from the campsite with several others after dark without any kind of light (it was overcast that night, and somehow six of us forgot to bring along a single flashlight).   It took us an hour to slowly walk only a few hundred yards with everyone holding on to the shoulders of the person in front of them, and the person in front feeling for trees along the side of the trail.  And I don't know how many times I have lay awake in my tent by myself or with one other person trying to figure out if the noises I hear are just the wind, or something looking for a meal, and how big is that something?<br/><br/>To this date, I shudder whenever this movie is mentioned.

"ozymandiaskingofkings","1","13","24","20 October 2009"," Badly made, badly acted and about as scary as a boy scout camping trip.
","It's not often I say this, but i hate this film. It's a boring, badly written, badly made piece of crap posing as an arty verite style film, and has it's status purely due to hype and clever marketing gimmickry. Most of the action is plot less, just some morons bumbling round some woods. I mean, I used to go camping in woods with my dad all the time, it's not an especially scary environment for me. Plus: it's some damn woods, not the Amazon jungle. There's bound to be other people there and it's not exactly going to be hard to find your way out. It's just not believable. And most of the film is just them lost in some woods, it's not exciting, it's just something that happens thats inconvenient. It's like making a horror film about missing a bus, or something.<br/><br/>Unlike films such as Deliverance or Eden Lake, I never actually felt the protagonists were in any actual danger. Sure the odd creepy thing happens, but apart from the end (which I admit was great) scary stuff is few and far between and as for the documentary aspect, surely the point of a documentary is you shoot the interesting/relevant stuff. Their rationale for continuing to film was nowhere near as persuasive as the one in REC.<br/><br/>I guess the main reason I didn't like the film was that I really didn't care about any of the characters. Heather just spent all her time whining/crying, whereas the two guys had almost no personality at all. I really wasn't bothered what happened to them. And there just wasn't enough to hold my interest, the ideas ran out as soon as they entered the woods. Not enough happened to sustain my interest and given the film was only 80 minutes long, thats really saying something. It felt to me like a film school short that had been expanded to me, rather than a fully rounded film.<br/><br/>A good comparison is The Evil Dead where the direction and camera work served to create tension. In Blair Witch is looks in parts like they just ran aimlessly round some woods with a camera, while in Raimi's film the camera also prowls around and snakes along the ground, but it serves a purpose in doing so, offering a perspective of the entity that haunts the woods. In Blair Witch, the trouble isn't subtlety, it's that we don't see ANYTHING remotely frightening, not even glimpsed.<br/><br/>It isn't like Rosemary's Baby where the questions of what is supernatural and what is just coincidence/imagination pervade throughout the film but are finally resolved, there is a frustrating lack of closure. Sure, you could say it's just being left open to interpretation, but there are so few clues/pieces of information in the film with which the audience can gain any understanding, I just see it as sloppy writing. It started brilliantly, the interviews with the townspeople seemingly foreshadowing a much better film which ultimately never materialises, but doesn't build on that. I don't want to see a lot of hokey special effects of anything, but I did expect to see more horrific things happening than just three irritating people walking round a wood for what felt like forever.<br/><br/>I don't expect people to go watch clichéd slashers and remakes. I hate those movies too. But there are a great many better horror films out there than this one and it mystifies me why this one was singled out for so much acclaim. OK, so the 90s being a rubbish overall decade for horror probably helped Blair Witch and the verite style is cool to begin with, but the whole thing is underplotted and thinks it's much smarter than it is. It substitutes incoherence for a plot and screaming/bickering for intelligent dialogue and effective character development. This film is sort of like the emperor with no clothes. Everyone is told of it's brilliance, and people follow suit without really stepping back and looking how it works as a film, as a narrative work or a genre piece. The truth is, it doesn't work well as either."

","WARNING. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES SPOILERS !!!<br/><br/>This week-end, my girlfriend and I saw ""The Blair Witch"" project on French TV. I was very impatient to see it after all the hype and rave reviews it got when it was released. Dammit, it sucked. It really did. All you have in this movie is three idiots lost in the woods, screaming at each other. And that's it ! Only this. Nothing happens at all. Most of the time, the screen is just pitch-dark, or so obscure that you can't see anything. The plot, which relies on so-called realism is plain stupid. For instance, how come these guys didn't hire a guide to help them find their way in the forest ? And why the hell does one of the characters just throw away the map ? How come their camera's battery never runs out ? And when a person is about to die, does he/she really keep filming himself/herself without doing anything else ? The list could go on and on. Not only is this movie stupid and ridiculous but above all, it is boring, terribly boring. I mean it : don't expect this to frighten you. In my opinion, absolutely nothing can redeem this thing. And I can't possibly understand why some people acclaimed it and made it such a huge success. The original concept may have been good but the actual result is a complete failure.

","""Blair Witch"" is one of those movies that either lives or dies on whether or not you're really, really scared of the things that go bump in the night. If rocks banging around, bundles of twigs hanging in trees, and unknown voices in the night are what freak you out, then maybe you really will be scared by what's happening here.  Still, the whole ""the most terrifying thing to the human mind is the unknown"" is a little overplayed here, to say the least.  Hey, even in ""Jaws"" we eventually got to see the shark.  This thing was made on a shoestring budget and it shows.  Why did they even bother to use 16mm when the best parts are on video?  Anyhow, blah, blah, blah, get ready for a disappointment, folks.  This thing probably would make a good five-minute campfire story, but for crying out loud, why make something that goes on for so long but, like our heroes, really doesn't go much of anywhere by the end?<br/><br/>Having said this, sure, most of you are going to go see this movie anyhow. I can't even convince my friends not to.  But if you have any morals, at least buy a ticket for something else and sneak into ""Blair.""  This movie isn't worth the price of admission."

Even Gilligan would not have been that dumb to carry out their own demise, not from the confrontation of the Witch, but with their own ignorance.

"tedg","Null","12","22","10 January 2002"," In the Corner
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this little film. I had stayed away because of the kiddie audience, but I found it intelligently conceived.<br/><br/>
The first thing in film is to decide who the camera is. The gutsy thing is to make it a character, and the most straightforward way to do that is by POV shots from someone in the story. `Strange Days' has the best POV sequence I've seen. But these are hard to manage, and almost always used sparingly.<br/><br/>Horror, real horror should rely on something deeper than shock or disgust. Most strategies depend on creating a character (sometimes a situation) that is threatening. In this case, the scares in the theater are due to direct encounters with this character. But even then, that bugaboo is threatening the people on screen, not you.<br/><br/>In this gutsy move, the strategy is all focused on placing the viewer within the film. Every shot is POV, from either a 16mm camera or B/W video, often shooting each other. Rather brilliant conception, but from there one has a few big problems to solve.<br/><br/>The big one is how to handle the exposition. It may not be obvious in most films, but there are two completely independent jobs of the storyteller. The filmmaker is a clockmaker, creating a world, characters and situations within that world. Some collection of devices must be managed to tell or show us the viewers what this is all about. The other job is the real work: allowing the clock to work: the characters and situations developing in some engaging way.<br/><br/>The first part is no small matter in horror or its sibling, science fiction. Most clever approaches use visual shortcuts to refer to previous movies, but that's another story. Another approach is to adopt a world that we all know: from Potter or Ring books, or old TeeVee shows or comic books. What these folks do is a radical departure: they did all their exposition outside of the film, primarily on the web, but also with a TeeVee documentary on the documentary. <br/><br/>(If you like this notion of a created metadocumentary, check out the the mind-blowing `The Falls.')<br/><br/>Then, all the film has to do is reference that `myth' in a few, very well engineered `townspeople' interviews. We have one visual motif, the stick figures. One environmental reference, the stacked stones (and the `coffin' stone). And we have just one narrative device, and this is where the intelligence of the filmmakers impressed.<br/><br/>For all the time in the woods, essentially nothing happens. There's incidental friction; they encounter sticks and stones; one member vanishes; a puzzling `message' is delivered. But there's no narrative advance. Until the very, very, very end, when Heather goes in the basement and sees her friend in the corner. By this time, we have been groping to tie the `myth' to what we see. We are given this one touchstone to the myth, about one child being put in the corner while another is killed in presumably some gruesome way. That connection sears for only a second, then our eye goes blank. (That this was the video, not the film, is especially well conceived.) The whole narrative is collapsed into that one second that we see with our own eyes. Right there. We explain it, not anyone in the film. Scarey as all getout. Clever. Self-referential."

","Let me make myself perfectly clear from the start:  I went into this movie with *NO* expectations whatsoever.  I had no exposure at all to the hype. My younger brother told me how terrible this movie was, but I thought it must have *some* redeeming value -- in fact, it sounded interesting.  After seeing it, I realized that it had no redeeming value.  It was bad, bad, bad. Dull.  The fact that I made it all the way through without turning it off is a minor miracle.<br/><br/>Another thing -- I'm not at all lacking in imagination.  I love atmospheric films.  I've felt a creepy sensation being in the woods before (although I usually just feel peaceful) and was terrified of the dark as a child (I got over it!)  But the fact is, this movie had no atmosphere.  It had no acting (though plenty of ridiculous overacting).  It had no plot.  It had no cinematography.  No directing.<br/><br/>In fact, this wasn't a movie at all.  I don't know what it was... I don't...<br/><br/>I know... it had to be a farce!  I get it now... someone posted several hundred positive reviews using different names on the IMDB, trying to get people to watch it.  Must have been whoever released the film.  The production company must have been in on it.<br/><br/>Honest... how else to explain why ANYONE would consider this dull, meaningless piece of junk?  I feel very cheated that I wasted the money to rent this on DVD.  I would feel cheated if someone offered (and paid) me fifty dollars to see it again.<br/><br/>The only film of ANY genre I've seen that was worse was ""The Telephone"" (Whoopi Goldberg).  This film goes down as #2 on the bottom 10 films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Long after the release of this piece of trash, I remain utterly baffled that anyone with an IQ over 25 (or under 25, for that matter) would see any redeeming value in this film.

","When Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez came up with the idea to create a mock documentary made solely to creep people out, they were definitely playing around with a good idea.  The movie could be made on an extremely tight budget.  The shaky camera work and poor film quality would actually do the film a service, by making it seem all the more genuine.  And, finally, the movie could rake in a fortune because, when you think about it, who doesn't like to hear a good ghost story, every so often?  Too bad this one doesn't chill you to the bone, like the directors had intended.<br/><br/>The long, arduous filler scenes used between the scares also made Witch a less-than-perfect ""project.""  We have the 2 minute horror scene, during the night, then the 10 minute filler, during the day.  After 2 or 3 times, this cycle becomes an exercise in tedium.  Not to mention, despite what everyone is saying, the horror scenes weren't really that terrifying . . . with exception to one.<br/><br/>It is this scene, the last 5 minutes of the film, where The Blair Witch Project succeeds amazingly well.  What is revealed during the last 5 minutes of Witch (don't worry, I'm not going to tell you what it is), will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end.  This isn't something you'll forget easily.  Once you've seen it, it's gonna be ingrained inside of your brain for a long time.  You could come down with Alzheimer's, be hit by a truck, fall off of a bridge, and be thrown into a coma, and you still wouldn't forget the finale of this film.  It's that creepy.   That horrifyingly memorable.  That intense.  It's what The Blair Witch Project, in its entirety, reached for, but never quite grasped."

","I can't believe that The Blair Witch Project has such a low rating here at IMDb. Guys, this an intelligent horror movie that changed a lot of things on how movies in general are made today (not only the horror genre).<br/><br/>* This is the movie that basically created the Found Footage genre. I know that there were some Found Footage movies before, but this was the movie that made it popular. There are thousands of Found Footage movies nowadays like Chronicle, Cloverfield, REC and so many others that wouldn't exist without the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>* This is movie that made it popular the viral marketing campaigns. For several blockbusters nowadays, it's almost obligatory to have a marketing campaign and this is the movie that created that!<br/><br/>And besides all that, this is a horror movie with a great story. It's not a shitty and gore movie like Serbian Film or a dumb teenage stuff like Scream."

I think the real issue for me was that I just couldn't get into the story, I mean how can you get THAT lost when you have a map and compass. They walked for 15 hours and ended up where they started, how is that possible when you have a compass? They even decided to walk in a set direction, SOUTH, surely to end up in the same place there would have had to have been a point where they were looking at the compass and it was pointing NORTH usually a good indication your walking THE WRONG WAY.<br/><br/>I have two flat mates in their first semester of a media and broadcasting degree and in all honesty I've seen them produce more plausible, better edited material than this.

Okay, I really doesn't scare easily, but what's wrong with this movie is that all of the characters are so annoying, that after less than half an hour you're just looking forward to see them get killed in some bizarre way. And while hoping for this to happen may be slightly exciting, it's certainly not scary. Second, I don't like the hand-held low-quality cams, but that's just me.

"Beeblebrox","Null","7","12","3 August 1999"," A refute to the detractors. (possible spoilers)
","Considering the comments of 90% of the comments on this site, this film has proven to be(for lack of a better word) powerful.  There have been some criticisms that I think are unfounded, especially if you pay close attention to the dialogue.<br/><br/>""No real person would keep filming while going through what we saw on the screen.""  If the film itself did not address this issue, I would be inclined to agree.  However, during one of the day shots Josh began repeatedly bothering Heather about why she was still filming.  She replied that this(filming) is all I have left(to keep her sanity).  Furthermore, when Josh goes behind the camera, he says something to the effect of, ""you know, I can see why you keep filming.  It's not quite reality through the viewfinder, you can trick yourself into thinking that it's not real."" Heather was the only one I think who truly thought this way...she pretty much just bullied, nagged, and prodded the others into going along with her.<br/><br/>Another complaint was why didn't they use the stream or the sun to find their way out of the woods?  Well, you could go for two arguments here. One, perhaps they were just too dumb or too scared to do it correctly. Which is fairly hard to swallow considering that following a compass' arrow isn't rocket science, but can be an argument nevertheless.(Perhaps Heather never read her bought copy of How to Stay Alive in the Woods)  What I think happened is that the witch kept them where she wanted them.  If this supposed supernatural being is real, I don't think confusing a group of lost students who are obviously out of their element would be that big of a deal.<br/><br/>
It is not very difficult to tell who ""got"" the movie.  It's not a question of academia, or film history, or even horror itself.  The way the movie gets you is the involuntary empathy you are drawn into because of the immadiance which is achieved by only using footage shot by the actors from their cameras.  Sure, many people hated the characters and found them annoying, but such is life.  In the real world, not all are are likeable or sometimes even believable.  <br/><br/>If you get a chance, read how the film was shot.  It's an interesting story. Basically, the directors put the three into the woods with no script and two cameras and left them baskets with tiny portions of food and a few needed plot events.  They told them, ""you won't see us, but we will be watching.  In the night we will mess with you.  We won't hurt you, but we will try to scare the hell out of you.""  Did it work?  I think so.<br/><br/>The film is full of gems.  The humor, Heather's soliloquy, and of course, the end scene.  Even using the black and white 16mm camera for the final shot gave it the crispness and utter dread that marks it as art that can only be fully appreciated if one pays careful attention to the initial interviews.  <br/><br/>This film is more than a horror movie.  It should be rated NC-17 not because of gore or porn(which there is none) but because of the utter frankness and reality that the film submits to the viewer.  Children, the faint of heart, and those with mental or emotional stress should avoid this movie.  Pardon the language, but the only succint way to describe this film is ""It will f*ck you up."" (stolen from one of the previous posts, would credit but don't have your name handy). I'm sure this is one of the best films I've ever seen, but I'm not sure if I ever want to see it again."
"The_Void","1","14","29","21 November 2003"," The worst movie of all time
","This film is horrific. It's horrific that it came fifth in Channel 4's scary moment poll; it's horrific that it got good reviews, and it's even more horrific that people actually like this trash. Quite simply, The Blair Witch Project is the worst film of all time. ...and yet somehow, while this film is on the same level of crappyness as films like Freddy got fingered and The Fast and the furious (except Blair Witch isn't as good as those two), I still get the feeling that someone is going to disagree with me.<br/><br/>For the first part of this review, I will be doing things a little differently than usual. Usually I would write out my views of the film in paragraphs, however, this time, to highlight the misinterpretations that people have of this film, I'm going to show you what my TV guide's say:<br/><br/>
Named and Shamed 1: 'What's on TV' (The UK's best selling TV magazine)<br/><br/>
""Three student film makers get lost in the woods while investigating a legend. Forsaking special effects, this low budget documentary-style fright fest is a return to the basics of what screen horror should be all about - sheer terror""<br/><br/>****/****<br/><br/>Errrr...what? Excuse me, 'Sheer terror', pardon me if I'm wrong, but when I think of sheer terror, getting lost in the woods isn't the first thing that springs to mind. And where the hell did they get 'fright fest' from? I spent most of the movie waiting for something to happen, not being scared out of my wits. sheesh.<br/><br/>Named and Shamed 2: 'Weekend' (The TV magazine that comes free with 'The Daily Mail' on a Saturday)<br/><br/>""How does a film with a tiny budget, no stars and no effects become one of the scariest movies ever? Simple, by making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. That's the ingenious mind game carried off by this 1999 horror hit, which pretended to be the video diary of three film students lost in a Maryland wood""<br/><br/>****/*****<br/><br/>Well, first off, credit where credit's due, at least they didn't give it full marks. I'll talk more about the mind game thing later but I don't how that makes the film scary, so what something that's not scary but real is somehow scary now? When I was about 10 my grandfather videoed me playing football, that was real, but was it terrifying? No.<br/><br/>I have a more simple answer for their question though: It doesn't.<br/><br/>
Named and Shamed 3: Sky TV's information button<br/><br/>""This terrifying film follows three student film makers who went in search if the Blair Witch only to discover the meaning of true horror""<br/><br/>
I think this is my favourite of the three comments. 'the meaning of true horror', oh what? So the meaning of true horror is walking around the woods with a camera? sheesh, its ok guys, none of us have anything to worry about ever if that's as bad as it gets.<br/><br/>
People seem to think that no gore, no special effects and no big shocks are a good thing. And they can be, if done correctly. Take Rosemary's Baby for example, there is a film that has no gore, no effects and no big jumpy moments, and it worked, know why? It has an idea behind it. The idea that a woman could be carrying the child of the devil is a genuinely frightening idea, it probes into the unknown, and that is a terrifying thing to do. Getting lost in the woods, not only doesn't probe into the unknown (people have been lost in the woods before); it's just genuinely not scary. Maybe getting lost in the woods with a man eating bear might be a scary thought, but just getting lost in the woods isn't. Ok, if you really did get lost in the woods it might be frightening, but for a film, I think we need a bit more plot than that.<br/><br/>For a film to be good, we're not talking Oscar winner here, just merely good, it needs to have several things, including:<br/><br/>a plot a decent script Direction Acting Watchability<br/><br/>Blair Witch doesn't have any of these. Look:<br/><br/>a plot - Plot? What plot? Ok, so we have a reason why they go in the woods, but once they get there, then what? Nothing happens except for them finding a few twigs and stuff hanging from trees. Lame. a decent script - I realise that they were trying to make things look real, which gives the effect that there isn't a script but whereas in most other films the script is used to move the story along, in this film all the script is a bunch of shouting and moaning. I mean, ok, fine you're lost in the woods but surely you wouldn't just sit there shouting at each other all day. Direction - I think it's hard to judge whether or not this was directed. It just looked to me like a bunch of bad camera angles loosely strewn together.<br/><br/>Acting - Wasn't any. Watchability - I can't see any reason to watch this film. I mean watch the film again. It just isn't watchable, the way the camera(s) move is annoying, and it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Well, really nothing goes on. The movie's more boring than Streetcar.<br/><br/>The producers of Blair Witch however realised that to sell a film, you don't need those five things, you just need one thing: marketing. And sadly, they were right.<br/><br/>I remember back in 1999 when this crap....err...film was released. Out of nowhere came great reviews, spouting crap like 'it's terrifying'. I didn't go to see it as soon as it came out, but some of my friends and family did, and every single one of them came back saying that it sucked. However, I thought 'uneducated fools, what do they know?' and then guess what? I went to see it and they were right. It's a good job the film wasn't much longer, I reckon I'd have left if it were.<br/><br/>Then we've got this mind game thing. About it being real footage. When I first went to see it this rumour was still ripe and I thought it was really real. Well, actually I was under the impression that this was a film based on actual footage, not the actual footage itself, but anyway, same difference. So how come I still wasn't in the least frightened? And how come even now, now that everyone knows that the rumours aren't true, why do people like the writers of my TV guides say it's scary? why why why? It's too boring to be scary.<br/><br/>I suppose they do deserve some credit for pulling that off though, even I was fooled. But that's credit for the producers, not for the film itself. It's a shame actually that this rumour was done with this film, if it were done for a good film, movie history could have been made. What a waste.<br/><br/>
Then we come to the 'utterly horrifying' ending. Well actually, last time I checked, a man stood in the corner while a girl drops a camera isn't scary, but it looks like I'm wrong again. It's horrifying. I realise that at the start someone said that's what happened to a kid or something, but so what? It's still not scary.<br/><br/>One of the (many) main reasons why this film isn't scary is that non of the characters are engaging, or even likable, the audience has no reason at all to like them, so why would we care if one of them has to stand in the corner? Even if it was frightening, who cares? For a good example of something horrifying happening to someone, see The Wicker Man. The Wicker Man did a good job of making itself scary because the character of Sgt Howie was portrayed as being likable so the audience could identify with him, and so when his time came, we felt empathy towards the guy, but what did we feel here? Absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Blair Witch can be summed up in 5 no's.<br/><br/>
No effects No gore No shocks No stars Nothing<br/><br/>I give this trash 0/10. What? What do you mean I can't? Oh ok, fine, 1/10, but I'm being VERY generous. I even feel like upgrading every film I ever gave a 1/10 to a 2/10, just to emphasize how bad this was, but I can't be bothered."

","Smash-hit independent horror film made quite an impression on the audiences of 1999 for good reason.<br/><br/>Three student film makers go into the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a legendary witch. When they suddenly find themselves lost, they end-up becoming part of the legend themselves!<br/><br/>Clever film is played out as a 'real' occurrence from beginning to end and frankly many viewers at the time thought it was indeed real footage shot by real missing students! Of course, it isn't, but it still went down as a landmark film of the decade. Although many people have mixed feelings about this movie, it's a unique film that pays off chillingly well for horror fans.<br/><br/>This movie is all about mystery, atmosphere, and the unknown - all of which are themes that pay off well as the increasingly dark story unfolds. There's plenty of memorable moments to be had (the scene that pays homage to The Devil and Tom Walker is especially horrific) and it all builds to an intense climax that is truly eerie. The young stars (Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) are likable and sympathetic characters, even as their desperation drives them to anger and fear. The setting of the autumn wilderness is effectively unsettling, the old house used for the finale being particularly creepy. <br/><br/>While some people laugh it off, which is a shame, this fan enjoys this film for it's sheer simplistic brilliance. After all it's not only one of the biggest independent films ever but quite possibly the smartest horror film of the 90's. A solid winner that deserves more respect. <br/><br/>**** out of ****"

You literally see nothing happening, just some moments where you think something is going to happen but then nothing, back to the 3 people being scared and breathing and crying into the camera. The hype for this movie is really when it was thought to have been based on a ""true"" documentary. Otherwise, it's really just pointless amateur video recording like the ones you do for drama class.

It is so terrible and annoying that I had a difficult time sitting through it. <br/><br/>It may have been the 'first', but it does not hold up in any way to its descendants.

"AlsExGal","7","5","8","19 December 2009"," Much better than its reputation
","It seems many people dislike this film because they think the entirety of its reputation lay in the confusion/publicity campaign generated at the time of its release as to whether it was a real film found in the woods of Maryland that documented the disappearance of three college students or whether it was just a movie. What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.<br/><br/>The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring. Although I like this movie, the sequel, ""Book of Shadows"", is just awful. Its makers Hollywoodized the original concept and thus made it completely incoherent and unwatchable. Avoid it at all costs."
"piteco_e_thuga","10","8","15","19 May 2016"," Most creepy and disturbing movie I've ever seen. This movie is the reason why I hate horror movies.
","I watched ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 2000 when I was about 9 years old with my older cousins and I remember I was in the room with them, because I thought it was just another documentary on Discovery Channel. I really believed everything I was seeing was true. Just imagine the impact that this movie made in my mind at that time. Those final minutes of ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the truly hell and nightmare on screen. I had never experienced that feeling of dread before. After I understood it was just a movie, but by then it was late. The scenes and disturbing sounds stuck in my mind for weeks and I take weeks sleeping with the light on to recover. I grew up with the certainty that I'm not a fan of horror movies.<br/><br/>Every horror fan is naturally a masochist. It's the pure masochism to love being scared and distressed for hours, days and even weeks. This is not my case, so I always avoid to watch this film genre. But I need to give ten stars for Blair Witch, because this movie really was able to mess with my most instinctive fears without show in no time the witch's face, or whatever the hell was that thing that was chasing those adolescents. This movie was creepy because the fear that it brings is the fear of the dark, fear of being lost walking in circles, fear of unknown sounds at night. That alone is scary enough, but there was also the growing fear of someone or something is stalking you and that there is no escape. Today I think the most brilliant thing is that the movie does not deliver anything ready for you. The plot just forces you to imagine what really happened to the three teenagers - and every possibility is more sinister and darkness than the other. Thinking better, there are certain things that are better not be seen. No doubt, the most disturbing and creepy movie I've ever seen. Well, I'll never see it a second time, but if you are a horror fan, mainly psychological, then this movie is for you."

From the journal of Stefanie DeCassan, film crew member<br/><br/>""...and the tent started shaking and we heard babies crying outside, and so I think that all of our first reaction was 'I'm not getting up... this is not happening...'"" Joshua Leonard, lead actor<br/><br/>There's something about The Blair Witch Project most people fail to realize. This is not just a movie trying to pass as a documentary with great marketing outcomes. This is the one of the sickest, most daunting, barely legal human breaking experiments ever made in cinema.<br/><br/>Haxan and Artisan really went off their way trying to pass this as a true story until their premiere at the Sundance Festival. But co-directors Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick also pushed things to the limits while trying to give the acting and shooting a sense of creepy realism. For that purpose, they hired three inexperienced and unknown actors with high improvisational skills, gave them a crash course on the filming equipment, sent them to the woods in Seneca Creek State Park, Maryland, and directed them remotely, giving them no script dialogues and only a brief guideline of what was to come. The result is a genuinely terrifying experience which proves to be like no other, if you embrace it as it should be embraced. This is getting more and more difficult to achieve, as some parts of the movie have now been spoofed beyond maximum tolerance and without deserving that treatment. But giving it the proper personal investment, you will be dragged into the woods with three people. And you will feel confused, scared, exhausted, hunted, haunted, and on the verge of physical and mental collapse. All these were felt by the actors at some point. You stretch your physical and mental limits, and you will end up entering a different, unfamiliar reality, where nothing's certain or safe anymore. The most eerie and haunting fear of all is the fear of the unknown. If you end up being led by the darkest places of your imagination, you'll end up seeing the most frightening things under the dimmest light...<br/><br/>For all this, and because I can truly feel that when I can create the right conditions upon viewing of this film, The Blair Witch Project stands in my book as the ultimate horror experience, side by side with the cult classics that gave me true nightmares when I was younger.<br/><br/>Top notch."

","Every time I tell someone my age (15) that I thought this movie was truly scary, they laugh at me, and they tell me how boring they thought it was. they never fail to mention how awful it was that it had NO violence, and showed NOTHING scary or sexual. Just try to put yourself in the character's situation. You'd panic and lose your mind too.<br/><br/>The movie consists of the ""real"" footage that was ""found"" in the woods, that involved three college students, Heather, Mike, and Josh, filming a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. First they interviewed several people. Then they headed out into the woods. When they got there, they lost the map, started freaking out, and everything went downhill from there. They found, and heard a lot of evidence that the Blair Witch might be out there. Soon, they realized they were being stalked by something, but they already became hopelessly lost, and scared. Soon, the camera fell over, and they disappeared.<br/><br/>This movie is actually truly scary. Not because it shows jump-out surprises, or shocks, but the behavior of the characters is what's scary. ""How can you be scared by people being scared?"" said one comment. The answer is that it's not them being scared that scares us. It's the thought of what they're scared of. You never know what could be out there, and there's no way of finding out (the sequel ruined this). The movie was set up as a publicity stunt, and became an internet phenomenon. This movie cheesed off many film goers who were expecting to see a horror movie in the style of the ""Scream"" movies. I praise everyone who understands the greatness of this movie.<br/><br/>By the way, the movie is very, very scary. When I saw it, I knew I would be disturbed, but this movie shattered my spirits for many months because it was so scary to me. The fact that the movie is COMPLETELY FICTIONAL, wasn't enough to cheer me up. Showing it to a friend was the only thing that could help me feel even a little better.

","Not being that in touch with Horror hype I haven't heard about the third Blair Witch installment until rather recently, so I've decided to watch the first films again (it has literally been over a decade). So after watching this title again I checked some of the trivia details and some web articles, a process which has lead me to the unfortunate conclusion that I can't recommend TBWP to any new spectators.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple (which is part of why it works). Three film students travel to an old city surrounded by woodlands in pursuit of information about ""The Blair Witch"", something between local folklore, an urban legend and a myth. The videotape some sites, interview some locals, and head for the woods for a night of camping before heading back to civilization. That's when things start to get wrong, as the trio gets hopelessly lost, tensions become high and someone (or something) obviously tries to make them feel unwelcome.<br/><br/>I know, thinking of that setting almost makes you able to visualize some of the scenes, and most chances are you wouldn't be far from what's actually shown in the film. That's because most Horror fans (and even certain fans of mainstream cinema) have by now seen titles exemplifying how the ""Found Footage"" sub-genre has improved and matured over the years (and I'd say it has become boring and tedious, but that's just my own thoughts and isn't relevant). No, in order to appreciate the Blair Witch you had to have been there, way back at the turning point of the millennium, when there still hadn't been a ""Found Footage"" sub-genre and perhaps two films (UFO Abduction of 1989 and its remake Alien Abduction of 1998) have ever used the ""documentary"" shooting style in a thriller or Horror film. I was too young to take part in the hype, but from I've collected - a website came up telling of a videotape found in a deserted camera in the woods near what used to be the town of ""Blair"". With no reason not to - people believed it. With no information to contradict this intuitive conclusion - people thought they were actually going to watch an authentic found footage. The producers handed out ""Missing"" flyers of the students (actually a cast of two actors and an actress) during the debut screening in the festival, the cast itself was forbidden by contract to make any public appearances, and most spectators simply didn't know any better.<br/><br/>Think about it. The web page. The characters' names being identical to the cast's names. Missing person flyers. A footage which in all standards looks precisely like a real documentary. Who could have known? Who would have guessed but the cynics and nay-sayers (who have an annoying habit of being right)? Watching the film under the impression the events were real would indeed justify the film being unofficially dubbed ""the scariest movie of all times"". And as much as it might today seem average at best both as a Horror title in general and as a ""Found Footage"" film specifically - numbers don't lie: 40k budget, near 300m earnings. That is how you make a legend.<br/><br/>If any of the anecdotes (true as far as I've been able to track) mentioned here have made you curious and you wish to experience the thrill over two decades after - go right ahead and watch this, just don't expect to have your mind blown. Remember, this is the film which officially gave birth to the Found Footage sub-genre, it was a cinematic and creative breakthrough, but s was the light bulb (and you're reading this on a computer or portable device). If you'd rather enjoy the legacy - go watch any other Found Footage Horror out there (any Paranormal Activity title comes to mind, of course) and know that it wouldn't be here without the pioneering genius of the Blair Witch Project."

"ironhorse_iv","6","3","4","12 December 2016"," Blair Witch Project indeed swept me off my feet, but it also flew off the handle of the broom. It was kinda nausea inducing at times.
","Shot entirely in the style of a documentary gone horribly wrong, this movie was indeed groundbreaking for the time, as it re-popularized 'the found footage' horror subgenre marketing style that was somewhat lost in the late 1980s, after the minor success of 1980's 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Using internet-based viral marketing, directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick was able to promote the idea that 'The Blair Witch Project' was truly the recovered footage of real documentarians that went missing in the woods of Maryland, in order to cover the local ghost stories, using fake online documents, footage, published dossiers, interviews, and even a couple of professional-looking television documentaries blurred the line between truth and fiction. The only problem with this, is that the movie doesn't know, what type of horror story, it wants to tell. For a movie titled 'Blair Witch', it doesn't really talk much about 16th-century witchcraft that much. Instead, it look like they wanted to talk about the fictional account of a 1940s child murder named Rustin Purr. Despite that, people were subtly convinced that these two legends were real, as opposed to something the film-makers made up themselves. Many were also convinced that the movie was based on a true story, or even consisted of actual footage. Because of this, the real-life actors, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael C. Williams had to play the part of the fictionalized version of themselves as demise, even after the credits start rolling. They did this, by not appearing in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. It really did seem, like they walk off the face of the earth to the point that a police investigation was order to expose the facade. For the most part, this verisimilitude marketing kinda works, as it got people interested in seeing this low-budget horror movie that has nothing much happening, including me. However, the marketing did leave some very jarring questions, like if this was a real movie, how was the film footage even recovered, if the woods was really that haunted. Another, is how was any upstart studio got the rights of the footage, from the families of the demise, and able to make a profit off their family members 'supposedly' deaths. Doesn't that seem, a bit odd!? Also, it's really hard to believe that this footage is indeed 'raw', when it look like it been edited to follow a narration path. After all, doesn't it seem a bit odd for these film students to film a lot of footage of them, arguing, cursing, & bickering with each other over a map, that they can't use on their documentary, rather than saving that footage for documenting the events. Still, I guess, they gave a good reason, with Heather's insistence upon filming everything, is suggested by Josh to be her way of coping with the fact that she's lost in the woods. Mad props to Heather's apology scene. She acted so hard that you could practically see the bite marks in the camera. She sobs, screams, and shakes so realistically that her acting was so convinced, making people forget that, she accidentally zoom the camera, too far on her face. However, I did think the directors went a little too far to promote discord between the actors, by deliberately ruining their sleep, and starving them. From what I heard, they were really butting heads toward the end. Still, it does seem, a bit out of character for one of them, to throw away the map for no good reason!? It doesn't make sense, unless, one of the students was really trying to kill the other filmmaker, but that's just a film theory. Despite that, I did enjoy the actors genuinely upset reactions, even if it was somewhat annoying at times. Still, it doesn't explain, why their film footage look like crap even in the beginning, if they supposedly go to film school. Yes, it can be said, the footage was made to look like it has degraded since it's been in the open woods for nearly a year, but it doesn't explain, why these 'student filmmakers' have so many badly shots. All these low grade blurry poorly focus shots make the movie, nearly unwatchable. Also the cringe-worthy shaking cam is really annoying, as it known to makes people vomit. Although, this movie show nearly nothing that was really scary. Like some sort of cinematic Rorschach test, there was enough suspense to keep me, looking for at least something that would get a reaction from me. I give the movie credit that, it didn't relies much on outright special effects of blood, gore, and violence to get people to watch; just the psychological horror and tension of unseen forces and sounds that is slowly ratcheted up with each passing day and night of the characters' descent into madness. It left everything to the audience's grisly imagination. While, this movie had a 2000 & 2016 sequel, 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2' & 'Blair Witch'. They didn't live up the hype of the first movie. Overall: I have to say, there is a strong reason why this movie lead a new age of 'found-footage' horror films. It was unique at the time, however rewatching it, now. It's a bit date. Nevertheless, it's not worthless, so no need to kick it in the creek. It's more like a nostalgia watch, these days. So check it out, if you want to."
"cjh668908","1","3","4","27 February 2013"," There's nothing worse than shaky camcorder footage
","This ""movie"" is a ""documentary"" about the so-called Blair witch legend. It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned. Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.<br/><br/>The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see. It's called psychological horror. Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal. The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example. The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards. In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shaky one at that. There is no music in the film. It's raw. It has a skeletal budget. It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers. It's basically a ""reality"" film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there. The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shaky and amateur-ish. This movie is unwatchable. It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache. It's fine to use a camcorder. I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary ""movie"". But at least make the footage watchable. I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shaky footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable. If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shaky camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shaky videos that people I know have made throughout the years. I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera. This film would have been better if the camera-work was better. Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camera-work and feeling dizzy with a headache, also. The bad camera-work robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film."

","The Blair Witch Project follows three teens (Heather, Mike, and Josh) as they trek out into the woods to do research behind the legend of the Blair Witch. They begin by interviewing several of the folks that live in the town near the woods, and almost everybody knows something about this witch. With the creepy tales of the witch swimming in their minds, they venture into the woods for what is meant to be just a three day camp out to shoot some scenes in the home of the ""fictional"" witch. Once they enter the woods things start declining from there. The first problem is that the circle- walking begins. Classic in any ""woodsy"" horror film. Because of the bewitchment of the woods, Heather, Mike, and Josh become hopelessly lost wandering in circles. While things definitely do get worse for them, the circle wandering is a very large chunk of the film. After they become lost in the woods, the film really has only 2 elements to it: wandering in hopeless circles in the woods, and listening to sticks crack at night. Are both of those things scary? Yes of course! Scary for an audience to watch for an hour and forty-five minutes? You can answer that for yourself. After they become lost in the woods, they begin to hear many strange noises and find mysterious, unexplained symbols placed all around them. Slowly the characters are forced to come to the realization that they aren't just lost. They are hunted. Josh is the first of them to disappear, then suddenly Heather and Mike are left alone to walk in circles and listen to sticks crack. Oh no! The film comes to what could be called a climax in the last five minutes when Heather and Mike venture out to find Josh, for the third time, and they are lead to an old abandoned house. Once inside, they follow his screams, and wind up in a basement where the film ends as you see Mike standing in the corner of the room. The camera goes black. After at least fifteen minutes of pure running, screaming and chasing, that is the end it comes to. Everyone dies. But are we really surprised?"
"Lucabrasisleeps","4","4","6","2 February 2015"," Frustrating Horror Film
","I don't want to give this a low rating. It is an original film. Yes Cannibal holocaust did this before, but that was a campy fun horror movie. It didn't really seem real in the way this one seems to be. When I watch this movie, I clearly see the characteristics of all its imitators (The Last exorcism, Paranormal activity). But somehow this misses the mark.<br/><br/>One of the major issues are the characters. For me, a slow burn horror movie can never work without enjoyable characters. Here what I saw was a bunch of immature people who do the worst things at the worst possible moments (kicking the flag?). Not that it matters though since maybe it was an Evil Dead sort of a situation anyway. But still these are things that maybe not many people would do in that situation. The constant bickering and the arguments drove me nuts. It spoils whatever atmosphere they want to create.<br/><br/>Again, the same criticisms of found footage movies apply here as well. While in a movie like Paranormal activity, the cameras can be explained, here it is incomprehensible why such hysterical people would still be able to hold on to cameras even in the worst moments. That doesn't make that much sense. Still I am willing to ignore these things if the movie isn't boring.<br/><br/>That is the biggest problem. Apart from the constant shaky cam and arguments, there really isn't much happening in the whole movie. And even when it happens, you can't see much anyway. No, it isn't the old style arty horror movie style, it is a shaky cam style where the camera shakes so much, you can't really see much. The ending is typical of the style. Nothing is visible and everybody dies. I was left unsatisfied by this style. It is funny, I do like other Eduardo Sanchez movies like Lovely molly and Altered.<br/><br/>Anyway I am disappointed very much. I can't rate it lower than 4 since it is clearly a unique horror movie but I can't say I enjoyed it."

There wasn't even a payoff at the end after putting up with all that BS. If i'm missing something please enlighten me.

"BillTodd","Null","4","6","3 August 1999"," Why BWP's unconventional approach makes it a winner
","I was out of the country throughout June and July, and subsequently missed out on the advertising and hype for ""The Blair Witch Project."" After being extremely disappointed by ""The Haunting,"" I caved in to the word-of-mouth about BWP and decided to give it a try. <br/><br/>I went into the theater not having seen the Sci-Fi channel documentary, not having seen a commercial, and not having been to the BWP website. I knew _nothing_ except that the story involved three college kids who go out to make a documentary about a witch. <br/><br/>I am _never_ scared by horror movies. I nearly slept through Scream, and Friday the 13th movies don't do much for me either. <br/><br/>Blair Witch had me sleeping with the light on. <br/><br/>Why? Because you could _believe_ that the events on the amateur video were real. They _could_ happen. To you. The power of this movie lies in it's ability to make you _believe_ that something is after these kids. And this isn't Jennifer Love Hewitt or Courtney Cox being chased around, this is Heather, plain Heather, who cries into the camera and has a visibly runny nose and we can see how scared she is. She's real. She really looks cold and scared, and it's details like the runny nose that do it. As the days of the expedition pass by and the group gets more and more on each others nerves, the infighting, the stress, the blame, the spooked nerves, all of the dialogue and actions are things that you or someone you know would have done in the forest. <br/><br/>I love Star Wars. I love digital sound. I love special effects. But this movie neither needed nor used any of them. It didn't have music. It didn't have the distracting, ill-used eye-candy visual effects if ""The Haunting."" This has the believable camera shakiness of somebody who knows there's something out there. They're shooting this on amateur video. It looks clunky. It looks cheap. This doesn't have the fine look of film, that refined look we're used to. This is gritty, seemingly real-world footage.<br/><br/>Then there's the sounds at night that we've all heard outside the tent. And the possibility that there's a witch behind them. It's in the possibility, the ambiguity, that ""Blair Witch"" is masterfully done. <br/><br/>That, and the last two minutes of the film, which I want a freeze frame for very badly. The last camera shot is one I'll not be forgetting for a long time.<br/><br/>Those who've not seen BWP, read no further. <br/><br/>Was there really a witch? Obviously there was a murderer, but was there truly effective use of witchcraft? Was it a spell that caused Mike to kick the map in the water, or did he really think it was that useless? Was it sorcery that made them come back to the same point in the river, or did they do as most humans do when walking without landmarks and walk in a huge circle? Was the slime on Josh's gear supernatural? Was that Josh's voice calling them to the house, or was it the The Murderous Old Man?<br/><br/>
We just don't know. At least, I don't, not until I see it again. And that's what makes this movie great. In real life, you really don't know if witchcraft is real- deep down inside, when we go camping at night we're slightly spooked by the snapping twigs or rustling leaves outside. And after having seen suspended effigies, ritual rock piles, and hands beating on the tent, we're all a little more willing to believe the unbelievable.<br/><br/>
It's this belief in the unbelievable that ""Blair Witch"" begins by poking fun at and slowly begins to nurture until, abruptly, it ends without giving an answer."

","Man...this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have never seen the movie as bad as the 80s Z-grade movies I watched on USA Up All Night. I'd rather sit through Guccione's integrated version of Calibula than endure this nauseatingly mindless trash again. <br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is the epitome of the independent filmmaking method that gleefully indulges in the four-letter word to cover up the fact that whenever the dialogues and ideas fizzle out, there always come the obligatory obscene and vulgar language in practically every line of dialogue to make up for the lack of substance and quality. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the level of profanity as long as the movie is interesting and balanced. But this movie went so far as to get on my nerves and made me so angry I wanted to unleash the fury on the videotape as soon as it ejects from the VCR after the movie ends.<br/><br/>The reason why BWP was made is simple: two amateur filmmakers kicked around the idea, recruited the young people and loaned them with the cameras to go into the woods to make a psychologically scary movie. The result is a mind-numbingly tedious exercise in self-indulgence and bad attitude all the way. This is the reason why I found the movie less scary and more irritating. Heather was so gratingly annoying I wanted to kill her onscreen. I literally had to beg for Joshua and Michael to die quickly and painlessly because they holler and scream and cuss at each other ALL THE TIME after the first half hour. At least they deserve the fateful death in the movie, but the fact that never cease to amaze me is that the so-called actors who relies on improvision comprising mostly of ""J***s C****t! F**k! S**t!"" are still alive and kicking. <br/><br/>What astounds me is that this overblown, overhyped and overrated film made big bucks at the B.O. and the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank. I hope and pray that they (and the filmmaking duo and the Artisan execs) will never work in Hollywood again because of this travesty that undermines the importance of reasonable quality and instills the repetitive use of the F-word and the abuse of the Lord's (whoever the Lord is, depending on your view and belief) name legitimate to make the product even more compelling.

","I love The Blair Witch Project. It's definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, but I understand why a lot of people hate it. It's actually a psychological horror movie, that what really scares you is your imagination rather than what is shown on screen (unlike 99% of the movies we see around). It's very slow burn but it isn't boring. Do not expect to watch a lot of action or jump scares. The first 20 minutes serves to build up the mythology behind the Blair Witch, and the remaining hour it's all about these 3 people lost in the woods. It sounds boring but it's not. The movie keep your attention because these people are interesting and they really look like real people, people you can relate to, you root for them to survive. There is also a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere during the whole movie that keep you with fear. It all seems real. You never know what really is haunting this people, it is the witch or is something else? It really scared me and I'm not a easy person to scare. I can count in my fingers the movies that scared me and Blair Witch is definitely one of them, specially the ending... The last 10 minutes are unforgettable. Scary, disturbing, tense, heart beating, edge of your seat type of ending. It's really the most scary part and the last shot still kills me till this day. It's impossible to watch The Blair Witch Project and simply forget. You will think about the ending for a long time definitely. It's all very subtle and creepy. The Blair Witch Project is a classic and it deserves to be watched by every horror fan. If you want to get scared, this is it, trust me. I don't know personally a single person who didn't get scared watching it. Go see it."

","This film currently on IMDb gets 6.3? It's funny how the same people that slated this film like Paranormal Activity. A movie that would never have come to be had Blair Witch not reworked the genre, yet a film that is cheap in comparison in strength of story, characters and realism. You cannot deny the impact this movie has had on others. The character development is intriguing and filled with mistrust. Heather is annoying but true to life, people are irritating and annoying at times:)The sound effects are subtle and create an isolation. The film gathers momentum and the fear of the dark really affect the viewer. The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't have a typical formula. It doesn't provide the viewer with any relief (cheap scares, cheap jokes that relieves the tension). Instead it constantly builds fear in the viewer with atmospheric sounds, visuals and the impending sense of tragedy. Nobody could honestly say they knew how this movie would play out. What sets this film apart from others are the empty surroundings. There have been many Horrors shot in woodland areas(mansions,cabins etc) but few entirely in the woods. The subject of witch craft was skillfully mastered. This film worked with a low budget where others would have failed."

","Tedious, overrated horror flick for non-horror fans. With a structure stolen from Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", could directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez go wrong? Yes. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is an amateurish deceit elevated to cinema release status by a million dollar sound mix and an expensive blow-up. It is a film that focuses on physical and mental dislocation, and mood. Unfortunately, despite its best efforts to unnerve the viewer, it is boring, and an endurance test to watch because of its chaotic camera-work. The producers of the film created a brilliant, effective internet campaign that convinced easily satisfied non-horror loving audiences that they were about to see something really scary. True horror fans weren't swayed by the hype. Essentially, the film/video is a home movie with zero aesthetic value. ""The Last Broadcast"", a similar piece that was made before ""Witch"", is the superior of the two, but still no great shakes."

","When this movie came out, I noticed that it was a litmus test for moviegoers. Some people I know were bored out of their minds and sickened by the camera work. Others, like me, lost sleep. For weeks. And, while I dislike branding an entire species, I still honestly feel that those who despise this film have no idea what imagination really is or are far too weaned on slasher garbage. Because this is the most terrifying thing I've ever seen, and because it accomplishes this by revealing absolutely nothing. You all know it backwards, of course. Let me just add that even the disagreeable elements, like Heather's annoying as hell character, came through as utterly real. Too bad that nothing good followed this because the BWP was as devastating a masterwork as you're ever gonna get for about 30K. Or a lot more. PS What was fun was asking cynical friends who trashed it, Well, what would YOU have done? One guy told me he would've simply started running. Nobody else had any suggestions at all.

"colossu5","1","6","11","15 January 2006"," Works better than the sleeping pill!
","Despite the obnoxious voices of the characters, this movie still does a better job than the sleeping pill does of putting one to sleep. In a nutshell, if you are entertained by watching characters stand around, complain, and act foolishly, then this movie is for you! Basically this movie is ENTIRELY about kids acting irrationally, complaining, and whining in the forest. Nothing happens to them, and they're all so annoying that you just hope they die. The first 99% of the movie could've been shrunk to a total time of 2 minutes (and even then it would still be a waste of film), and then the ending could've been made such that it wasn't quite possibly the biggest letdown in movie history.<br/><br/>Nothing about this movie is scary at all. At the end, there is finally hope that the characters might all finally die and the movie will finally be over but nothing is resolved at all because you do not know what exactly happened. Actually, when I saw this movie, I thought that it was either a joke or a faulty tape or something because the end credits just sort of spontaneously popped up and started rolling. That is why this movie is such a big joke/scam. The entire movie is spent the viewer wanting something to happen (which is probably hoping the characters get killed), but nothing ever happens, not even at the end.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, it's hard to even call this ""movie"" a movie. Why? Because there was no plot, terrible acting, no character development, no conflict (other than the absence of a medicine to cure stupidness), no resolution, no conclusion, and terrible cinematography. The only thing that this ""movie"" has in common with a real movie is that they both run on film.<br/><br/>I must give props to whoever's idea it was to come up with this ""movie"". After all, right now he's probably rolling in cash. Throwing together a ""movie"", taking absolutely no care in doing so, and then marketing it such that people flock to the theatres to see it is a genius way to spend practically $0, but make millions. I should follow his example (except when I make my movie, I will actually take time and care and make a good plot).<br/><br/>If you've ever seen a movie called ""Open Water"", this movie is exactly the same, only in this movie they're on land, there's more complaining, more stupid acting, and less of a plot. If 0/10 were an option, I would vote that for this movie in a heartbeat."

It is extremely boring and depressingly unscary.  There is absolutely no excuse, in my mind, for the mind-bogglingly crappy way the film was shot...things are out of focus, it is jumpy, and much of the time the film is either completely dark or the shot is of trees or rocks while action is happening elsewhere.  I realize it is supposed to be a documentary shot by amateurs, but there is no reason to put the audience through that for some arty notion of what is ""realistic filmmaking"".

The premise of three college kids making a documentary about a witch, and then being hunted, is refreshingly original. I didn't need special effects. I loved the shaky camera work. It made the premise seem realistic.<br/><br/>This is a love it/hate it type movie. Many people complain of the cheap production values. Well, the movie wouldn't have worked any other way. Another big complaint people have had is that they didn't understand the premise. They didn't know if it was supposed to be fact or fiction. WHAT,ARE YOU STUPID? I knew it was fiction from the get go. Do you think this would have escaped the news? Do you think the families involved would have allowed a mass-marketed movie to be released in the aftermath of their tragedies? Of course the movie was fiction. But, that didn't ruin a thing for me. I know that most every movie I see is fiction. That doesn't ruin my good time. And, with this movie, I was watching really good, really original fiction. I was glad to see a movie that didn't rely on millions of dollars of special effects. I was glad that we didn't see the money shot of the witch.<br/><br/>This movie left me thinking of possibilities of what happened for weeks. It also worked on a level that truly scary movies like ""Rosemary's Baby"" worked. Both movies were truly scary because they dealt with real fears, with human emotion. Neither movies showed any graphic violence, but both were truly scary. They made me think about scary possibilities that can't simply be discounted. That kind of stuff is a whole lot scarier than a guy in a hockey mask. So, even to those who weren't able to give this movie a chance, go rent it and watch it in the dark on a quiet night.

I really don't like this film, but I think it's because of the nonstop hype on it. You might like it, but set your expectation on low."
"TheMovieDiorama","3","5","9","2 October 2018"," The Blair Witch Project will have you become lost in your own boredom.
","The horror that popularised the ""found footage"" sub-genre (some would even say pioneer), gave way to future ultra low-budgeted features and proved that you don't need elaborate production values to make a film. You just need trees, rocks and a map. Now everybody go out and make a film! Unfortunately I'm not reviewing the excellently innovative marketing campaign that the film bolstered. I'm critiquing this snoozefest instead. A group of film students are filming a documentary about the ""Blair Witch"" legend and set off out into the woods to find evidence. Where they soon encounter frightening piles of rocks, spooky dangling sticks and a terrifying lack of basic orienteering skills. Oh yes, the scare factor is at an all-time high! Sit back, relax and prepare yourself to watch absolutely nothing. Nothing! Just three ridiculously unlikeable characters shouting and screaming at each other for 78 minutes whilst aimlessly wandering around a woodland area. ""Where's the map!?""! Someone give me a camera and find me some friends, I'll do the exact same thing and make a incalculable amount of money. On a serious note, I appreciate the stripped-back concept. It's not what you see that induces fear, but your other senses perceiving the unknown. A surround sound system works most efficiently as footsteps and faint screams are heard in every direction, creating an eerie environment. But when the poorly developed characters, story and pace are used to substitute onscreen scares, it doesn't work. You don't care. You just want the ""Blair Witch"" to savagely destroy them immediately. 78 minutes felt like 2 hours, honestly it is that poorly paced and boring. It's clear that The Blair Witch Project is divisive, and I suspect my opinion would be different if I watched it back in '99 with all the ""is it real?"" hype. Alas, it's aged badly. So much so that it just isn't scary, remotely interesting or captivating. Don't even get me started on that ending..."

When I finally got my long awaited chance to see the film, I kept looking at the nearest clock waiting for something really scary to happen and at other times just wondering when the truly annoying adventures of its three leading characters would end. I think Jabba The Hutt in ""Star Wars"" scared me more than this film. It's basically just a tireless exercise in testing the viewer's patience in which a certain word that begins with the letter ""f"" takes up about half of the inept dialogue and many things go by unexplained thus confusing the viewer. It all has to do with some legend about some being called the ""Blair Witch"" that may or may not exist but long before the time this film ends the viewer probably won't care anymore anyway if it exists. I know I certainly didn't. The shaky camera movements throughout the documentary filmed style mess are especially tedious. One of the poorest excuses for a horror film ever."

","I have seen this movie 3 times and i still believe that it is excellent. I have read most of the reviews of the film here, and most are positive, but the some of the negative ones bother me. I truly believe that they are missing the point! I have to agree that the film has been hyped too much, but at least the movie is worthy.( remember GODZILLA?). I saw the movie before the hype so I can't be accussed of being influenced by the hype. The average American moviegoer is lazy, unwilling to be challenged by a film. People today want to be wowed by special effects they dont want to use their imagination. That is what Blair Witch does, it chllenges the viewer to use his/her imagination. I love a good hollywood blockbuster as much as anyone, but they have become so  commonplace that they are not as good as they used to be. The Blair Witch Project proves that at times, less is more. What the audience doesnt see is scarier than what they do see. I can give a perfect example: in Jaws the movie was more effective whaen youm couldnt see the shark, right? The same has been implemented here. <br/><br/>I went to see The Haunting the other day, I hated it, good production values and thats it! No sense of real fear! After the movier ended i listened to people's reaction to it, most liked it! Im amzed, the movie had a stupid story, terrible acting, nothing memorable, but the people only talked about the effects! True some of the effects were good but cmon, The Haunting doesnt hold a candle to BW! People now seem to rate a movie solely on the SFX, that is sad.The point is The Blair Witch is an example of good planning and genuine desire to scare. The performances are incredibly real, especially Heather's. Her scene alone late in the film should earn her an Oscar nod! But Im sure that the snobs in the Academy won't recognize that it is a great performance considering the kind of film The Blair Witch is. Like any movie TBW may not be everyone's cup of tea, but some of the comments im reading are just ridiculous!<br/><br/>YES! The website was a clever way to raise interest in the film! YES! THe marketing for the film is aggressive! But the movie lives up to the hype if you go with an open mind, if you expect to see a movie like Scream( which I do like by the way) you will be disappointed. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN A MOVIE, LEAVE YOUR HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER EXPECTATIONS BEHIND. The Blair Witch Project is a fresh departure from the normal moviegoing experience!"

"paulg-67221","1","4","7","16 May 2016"," A typical dull found footage film
","Before I start going to details I will disclose the fact I am not keen on found footage films (although I do like Chronicle that is not a horror film and I am yet to see Rec). I find them to be lazily made and boring. This film is no exception.<br/><br/>The film follows 3 film students (Heather, Mike and Josh) who go out to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. Throughout the film they are tormented by supernatural forces and eventual die one by one. Their footage is found a year after they go missing.<br/><br/>The premise sounds promising, however, the actual film is anything but. The vast majority of the film is just footage the 3 arguing and speaking awfully improvised dialogue.<br/><br/>The acting is awful. I understand to increase realism they need to get unknowns to ""act"". The problem is all 3 of them cannot pull off a convincing performance nor did I ever care about the characters throughout. The fact that none of the 3 seem to still be acting today only proves my point.<br/><br/>The big problem is not much happens throughout the film. The only potentially interesting moments are too few and far between. Considering most of the time the characters are messing about, all scenes that actually matter to the ""plot"" could be condensed to about 10 minutes (that would be better but still awful). The film feels dull, I was never scared once throughout the entire film. This film generated a lot of buzz when it came out as did Paranormal Activity. Both films suck, I can't believe the masses gobble them up.<br/><br/>The ending is abysmal. It's all built up and no pay off. So after Josh goes missing, Heather and Mike look for him. They look through a house, only for Mike to just look at the corner and Heather to die off screen dropping the camera. It is underwhelming and when the movie ended I thought to myself ""that was it?"".<br/><br/>The problem I have with found footage films (especially this one) is that they are made cheaply and any mistake can easily be excused as ""being part of the film"" because they require little to no craft whatsoever. This movie cost $60,000 to make. El Mariachi cost $7,000 to make. Not only is El Mariachi actually fun unlike this film, it had effort and planning go into it unlike this excuse of a movie. The Blair Witch Project looks and feels cheaper than it is whereas El Mariachi is amazing considering how limited it was. What does that say about this movie when I can think of a movie that was cheaper to make was made better? Overall, a waste of time and money. If you want good ultra low budget films stick to something like El Mariachi or Nolan's Following. 1/10."
"Wilson102","2","4","7","10 September 2009"," waste of a good Saturday night
","Please, please, don't buy into the hype surrounding this movie. It was pretty darn awful. Let me tell you now; I'm a very squeamish and easily frightened viewer(I practically had a heart attack when a certain little girl crawled out of a certain TV-you know which movie I mean!) but this film did not have me diving behind the sofa cushions. Not even a little bit. It starts out good; the tension is there alright, but because it is set 'film documentary' style there is no atmospheric music to set the scene, which means any tension or atmosphere has to come from the actors. Maybe I'm missing the point, but a bunch of teenagers running around in pitch black woods whispering the 'f' word over and over-and yes folks, a good five minutes is spent where you can't see a darn thing and can only hear the sound effects as the kids drop the video camera and screech terrified obscenities to each other-doesn't really entertain me that much. Even then the volume had to be turned up ridiculously high just to hear what they were saying, then turned down again in disappointment as I realised I wasn't missing much. I found the scene where they emerge from their tents and practically have a hernia over some re-arranged twig formations more funny than ominous. Was anyone else willing the Blair Witch to pop out and say boo? Anything would have been less laughable than twig formations!! It is true that a good horror flick can entertain you not by what it shows, but by what it doesn't, but here is where the movie fails. Had the teens been stalked and chased down by an evil presence then it would have been frightening and entertaining, instead we have three college-age idiots lost in some woods and behaving like hysterical, well, college-age idiots. 'AHHH!! A re-arranged twig formation!!!' Please. Can you say 'low budget?' Give us viewers some credit! And I won't go into the disaster that was ending. Just as the movie builds up some tension and genuinely grips you to the screen, the credits roll. I had to go back to the title menu screen and repeat that scene just to make sure the DVD hadn't skipped. In the words of Comic Book Guy...'Worst Ending EVER'. Bless Heather Donahue, for she was meant for things far greater than this. Well, thankyou for taking the time to read my little review. I beg of you not to waste any more actually viewing this movie, if it weren't for the foul language it would barely make a PG certificate. There are plenty of better chillers out there, and I know children who wouldn't take this flick seriously."
"Soucriant","9","4","7","31 October 2008"," Fear of the Unknown
","The Blair Witch Project came out of nowhere for me. I was young when it was released, thus, all of the marketing and hype went over my head. I didn't see this film until long after the buzz had died down, about three or four years ago.<br/><br/>Even then, I knew The Blair Witch was something special. I was still relatively new to horror films, but I knew that nothing had been done quite like this before, and never so effectively.<br/><br/>There are no Hollywood gimmicks and touches here. It's not glamorous, the characters aren't typical teens in Hollywood horror, their existence isn't to pad the body count. We see these three people go from confident and determined documentary makers to the brink of madness. We live through this with them, we are THERE with them in the woods, which is what makes their experiences, and ultimately their fate, that much more terrifying.<br/><br/>I think the fear we all share as humans is not being able to see what is unsettling us. Things always seem much less frightening after you turn the light on, and in the daytime. In the dark, we are at our most vulnerable. We are essentially, blind. Couple that with the fear of being removed from our comfort zone and there you have it; the fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Someone or something is making those horrible sounds in the woods. Someone, or something left those pile of rocks outside the tent. Someone, or something led them to that house. Someone, or something was hunting them in those woods. But we can't see who or what. We're just like Mike and Heather. Blind.<br/><br/>The severe backlash this film has received, has kept it from reaching it's true place amongst the horror greats, in my opinion. Some people scoff at the idea of The Blair Witch Project being listed as one of the greatest horror films of all time. ""The Shining"" was panned on its release. Over 25 years later, it's viewed as a classic.<br/><br/>In years to come, I hope people look back at this film. I hope people study (or restudy, as may be the case) what makes it work so well. The Blair Witch Project has cemented its place in independent film-making history. My wish is that someday it receives the true recognition and status it deserves.<br/><br/>We won't see anything like this again, this was catching lightning in a bottle. Those of you who feel that creeping fear in the pit of your stomach as Mike and Heather enter the house, know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who don't feel the panic, the helplessness of this situation, the pure FEAR in those woods, I can safely say, it's your loss."

","I got to see this film after my brother's room mate and his girlfriend remembered the occasion of seeing it at a Home cinema in a cabin. I had heard very much about the title. Even at a Media class at my university the professor mentioned 'Blair Witch project' for the hand-held camera view. Also one of my friends came into making some short movies about campus and stuff, and he was really into it, so one day he said: ''Rei, let's make a movie, I mean a real feel movie, OK - not quite as Blair Witch project- but still...<br/><br/>After all this I just couldn't stand missing out on a influential piece of culture. The film itself is just one hour and a quarter long, but I guarantee you would want it to end way before and have impulses to check your watch.<br/><br/>The footage found from three (probably cinema) students that wanted to make a documentary over the legend of the Blair Witch, and for the purpose they went into the woods of Maryland to find evidence.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie! As a horror film it is a favorite. All classic horror movies are just ""directed"", they build the tension through some events the director chooses and the actors behave as if wanting to get your chills going. Well, in Blair Witch all that happens is perfectly - and I mean it - normal.<br/><br/>Just remembering the decline the group suffers, that you might think the guys will resort to inhuman acts to survive (probably in a Hollywood movie this would have been sought - but here the mere idea of it is oh so creepy).<br/><br/>It is as if I were in the group. The movie tempts me: 'Rei, what would have you done in this situation?' That's why it's so great and I preferred it so much.<br/><br/>After seeing it for the evening of course I couldn't get to sleep. I actually myself got going in the genre, so I put some fragments of classics, The Exorcist and The Shinning. Apart from just scenes in which the scare is inevitable, these look like toy inventions: they want to find a better way of scaring you. They just pale in comparison...<br/><br/>I don't mean to ignorant, but 'Blair Witch' is something that gets a special place in one's memory. It's a story. It's not a directed story, the interesting facts in and cinematic achievement to be remarked. It's a story that gets you gripped and it has full effect. After watching it think about the 'educational experience part'! If somebody asked me about my scariest movie or horror films, I'll just suggest them to see 'The Blair Witch Project'. A mandatory experience, in my opinion."

A very simple movie by today's ""Star Wars"" Standard, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is actual footage from three film students(Heather Donahue,Michael C.Williams and Joshua Leonard).The film and video tapes where found in 1995 during an archaeologist dig in the area by students from the University of Maryland, a year after the disappearance of the three students in 1994, in the very same woods were the filming of the documentary took place. The three had gone into the woods near Burkittseville, Maryland to do a documentary on a local Legend of The Blair Witch, never to be found again. The film is not of the best quality and there are a lot of scenes where you see nothing at all(but hear the students talking and the fear that surrounds and is coming from them),but what makes this movie great is the unknown.

","I never really was interested in watching this but when it got so much publicity, I thought it would be worth a shot to give it a look. I should have saved my money. I don't really find a film featuring ultra-profane, punk college kids that appealing. The movie might have been effective at what it aimed to do - to scare people - but it was just too sleazy for me. Of the three leads, the girl is probably the most annoying because of her smugness.<br/><br/>My main complaint is really not the movie so much as it was the marketing. This movie was viewed by millions of teenagers, and that's what the producers wanted. That, along with the college crowd, was their target audience. Hey, as far as college kids seeing this, I have no problem, but not high school kids.<br/><br/>To promote a film to that young a crowd - which it undeniably did - and have over 130 f- words, over 60 uses of ""sh-t,"" 20 usages of the Lord's name in vain and tons of other profanities - all in a paltry 80 minutes - is absolutely ridiculous and just plain wrong.<br/><br/>I recognize the inventive film-making. They make it look - effectively so - that the kids in the story are filming some sort of documentary. It certainly has that feel to it and it's very realistic in that regard. It doesn't rely on gore but on a psychological level for the horror. It shows the evilness of witchcraft and the occult. No problem.....but.....<br/><br/>I still remember my local library having an entire wall on where the computers are located, promoting this film, reading ""Hey, kids - It's Blair Witch Month. Celebrate with us....blah, blah, blah."" I am not making that up. Unbelievable, but that's our Liberal libraries these days. I guess that's what still ""sticks in my craw"" about this movie.

Undoubtedly inspiring to all, but sincerely not for everyone, the film is more than a horror film as it is barren of all gimmick and a real trail-blazer of the ""found-footage"" genre, the characters are so raw and believable that the audience almost feels unified with them in fleeing from something so frightening that it can't be felt or conquered, just simply acknowledged.

","In the woods outside of Burkittesville, Maryland a legend exists about the Blair Witch who supposedly killed many children in the 1940's.  A trio of film makers decide to go into the woods for their student project to document what they find in comparison with the legend itself.  They go missing.  A year later their footage is discovered and pit together to reveal what they went through when they became lost in the woods.  This film is the footage they recorded.<br/><br/>There is no doubting that hype was both the making and breaking of this film.  The hype got this small, no-budget film into multiplexes world wide where otherwise it wouldn't have got in the front door.  However the hype also raised expectation so that people were expecting the horrors to end all horrors etc.  Viewed without any hype this would have been so much better  but on a wave on such expectation few things can avoid coming down a bit.<br/><br/>Outside of this the set up is very good  put forward as true.  The way the film starts by mixing interviews with recollections of the legend etc gives us enough information to join the trio on their journey.  The film then begins to journey into the woods and the tension build nicely as we share some of the group's fear.<br/><br/>A lot of this comes down to the cast  they all start cheerful and young but as they go on they do seem genuinely tired and scared  this helps us believe.  The hand held cameras add to the realism but also put us right there with the group (if also means we don't see things but the fear comes from what's outside of eye line).<br/><br/>Now the film is very basic but in many ways that helps it.  There is no hidden subtext, no baggage  just things going downhill.  The film ends in the most basic way and is good for it.  While it may not be the most scary thing ever seen, it is refreshing to se a horror film that isn't another cliché ridden slasher flick.<br/><br/>Overall it may be overhyped and be suffering from a certain amount of backlash, but this is a very sharp, tight, clever and scary little film.  It is best viewed as a great independent and not a multiplex filler that it was hyped to be."

I understand the limitations involved in this small production and I respect its legacy, but I can't bring myself to watch this again and again. It's the type of movie you watch for the sake of knowing it since it's a pretty popular movie in film history, but it's also a waste of time and a big downer when you think about it. The acting is quite lame; it's understandable that it's made that way so it seems real, but honestly why would you watch a horror movie expecting realism?

However, soon after the genre was flooded again with much lesser films cashing in on Scream's success. <br/><br/>So what was the Blair Witch Project? A very different horror film indeed. While not the first of the found footage genre, it made a much larger impact than previous movies of the sub-genre had. And like Scream before it, it gave something fresh and original to the horror film scene. <br/><br/>Isn't that what we wanted all along? By 1990, slasher flicks were a dime a dozen. Same in 1999 with the films that followed Scream. Blair Witch went in to an entirely different direction. Sure, it was proposed before Scream (and filmed the following year of it's release), however, it came at a great time. Just as horror movies were yet again becoming tired parodies of themselves. <br/><br/>I don't even know why we need to put spoilers, seeing as just about everyone whose heard of the film knows how it ends. But know this: If you're expecting a bogeyman to jump out at you, then you'll be disappointed. If that's what you must have in a horror film, then keep going. Blair Witch operates largely on the elements of intrigue and suspense. Suspense, intrigue, both important elements to any great horror film (like Halloween). But unlike many of these films, there is no bogeyman on screen. Everything is left open to interpretation, with the general idea being the same. You clearly see these things happen in Blair Witch, but you have no real idea why they're happening, or who's responsible. You're not given an answer, you're not given violence and gore, you're not given big, on-screen effects, you never even see the antagonist's face. But you are given clues, ways to connect the dots.<br/><br/>But THAT is just what made this film great. It was a solid, original idea that was executed remarkably. It didn't follow a typical formula, but why should that matter? If this film couldn't be enjoyed for what it was, then it's not the fault of the film. Because it's simply not a bad movie. To dislike it because it wasn't well-written, executed, or interesting, I can understand. But if that's what you think, then are we even talking about the same film here?<br/><br/>It doesn't have the typical ending, or the typical ""bad guy jumps out at you"" moment. But it's a sure horror thriller, and the rhyme and reason is all made obvious if you've paid attention throughout.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a classic. A movie that laid the groundwork for mainstream acceptance of it's sub-genre, and became a masterpiece of it's main genre in it's own right. This is a must-see for any horror fan."

","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (14-30 July 1999) script & direction-Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sánchez Cast-Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams. Everything is unusual in this movie its camera, cast, location, concept & even mostly its marketing.People was told before releasing the movie that the movie is actually the edited footage of 3 film students which was recovered by directors after 1 year after their death in the haunted woods of Burkistville formerly known as Blair. (ofcours a marketing trick but at least not a cheap one like todays movies affairs & all...) the trick worked great and movie hit the charts. The rumors about the movie's story were produced even MOCK interviews of people supporting that story is true & of the parents of so called lost students were produced. The movie was shot like a documentary from actors themselves giving the original & amateur touch to it.The movie's like this-3 film students Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael Williams set to make a documentary on the old myth of Blair Witch in Burkistville,Maryland area.They start their shoot from the local cemetery & begin to interview the people in village. 2 locals tell them about the man named Justin Parr who kidnapped the 7 children & killed them during 1940-41. Justin took children to his house in woods which were said to be haunted by a spirit of lady killed in 18th century for witchcraft. Later when Justin was captured he told police that the witch in woods possessed him to do so. He used to kill the children cruelly he wold take 2 children in basement & kill 1 of them while other stands there facing the corner then he would kill the other too. Also a woman told 3 of them that she had an encounter with the witch in woods. All interview are shown like real interviews in documentaries, which sets the mood.Next day they start to search the woods for shooting the evidence of Blair witch. They left their car on road & start to walk toward the coffin rock, where 5 men found to be killed ritually some years before. In their way, fishermen warn them about the woods being haunted. They shoot coffin rock & camp there for night. Next day they went deep into the woods. But unaware of their exact location on map. At the eve they find the place like old cemetery, & saw the 7 small heaps of rock(cairns) on the ground. They set up the camp & in night return to shoot the cairns. Accidentally josh disturb cairn by his leg, which heather hastily repair later. In night, heather hear the strange noises in the night. Next they they start to walk to get their car. But at the eve they come to know that they are lost. Slowly temperature between them start to rise. Heather is boss so she starts trying to make the other 2 feel like everything is under control & it make the matter worst. They set camp again & now all hear the noises. Next morning, they find 3 cairns around their camp. They again try to find their way out, but map is also lost & near daybreak they discover the stuff like voodoo on allover the trees they get a another shock when they realize that they are standing on same place from where they started in the morning. The arguments in between starts to intensify out of frustration. That night with noises of children, they also feel the movement outside & rattling on their camp walls. Being Terrified, they run out & for a whole night remain out in woods. In morning they find their camp in all mess. Again after whole days fruitless walk & restless night, they found josh to be absent in camp next morning. They search him but...In night they start hear his screams & In morning heather found the small branches with teeth & blood.In night after hearing josh's screams again, they decide to go out & search him. They find old abandoned House & go inside it. & inside the house they run everywhere following his screams, but cant see him. finally when heathers camera fells on the ground we Can see the Michael standing in the corner!"
"thesar-2","8","3","5","3 April 2013"," The Real Witchbusters
","The coolest thing about seeing The Blair Witch Project back in 1999, probably two weeks following its release, was that people still believed one of the biggest movie hoaxes and most cleverest marketing ideas in cinema history. (This was marketed as a documentary on ""true life"" footage found when three young adults died from an apparent witch attack.) I even remember seeing the TV (later to be confirmed as a Mockumentary) special recapping what ""actually"" happened during the incidents of three film students that went into the witch'fested woods and never returned.<br/><br/>Now, I don't believe in ghosts, ""real"" witches, spooks, etc, so I never bought it. And my disbelief runs so deep, that the movie never once frightened me, despite my appreciation for what the film was. (AT THE TIME, that isand I'll get into that later.)<br/><br/>I do want to clarify, and I'm getting ahead of myself, something from that last paragraph: while I was not spooked, there was a moment, not 10 seconds from the end credits that was very creepy and thought was the most effective shot in the movie. Again – not scary, but absolutely eerie.<br/><br/>Much like what Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) was to that time period, was The Blair Witch Project to the late nineties. It was the found footage newborn. Sure, there were many, manyhorrifyingly too many rip-offs and more found footage films to come, and yeah, there were just a minute number before this, but this was the nice, original and refreshing in 1999. Again, I did not believe this was a true story, but they sure as hell made you at very least believe it was. And they did all that with almost absolutely nothing. I truly admire this movie.<br/><br/>The story was jokingly simple and that's not a bad thing when it comes to horror; think about: the masterpiece Halloween's thin script. As an amateur documentary project, two film student friends and a third newly recruited film student venture off into the woods where supposedly (to them) a witch killed many, including a lot of children decades past. Beforehand, in a fairly brilliant scene, they interview the just-outside-the-woods townsfolk for their take on the legend of the infamous Blair Witch.<br/><br/>Once inside the woods they're armed with their camping gear, expensive, yet ""borrowed"" cameras, a device known to us to be the pre-GPS: ""a map,"" and tons of batteries to ""run a small third world county."" That last one, I loved for, they actually explain why they can continuous film miles from an electrical socket and yet, for the countless – and unnecessary found footage films to follow, they seemed to have forgotten that simple plot explanation and make us believe their devices will basically run for weeks without a recharge. My phone dies in probably 4 hours without a charge.<br/><br/>But, I digress. Basically, the two males of the triangle of terrors are lead by the bitch (yeah, she was) Heather who claims to ""know where they're going"" deep inside the woods. As this does NOT turn out to be the case, tensions rise, and the typical motions of getting lost and feeling hopeless emerge. Oh, and lest we forget, there might be a witch out there hunting the witch hunters?<br/><br/>While I had admitted I wasn't frightened in this movie, this type of movie or pretty much any ghost stories, such as the weak ""found footage series of the next generation"" Paranormal Activity franchise, I found the built up tension, comradery between the cast of three, the comedy, cinematography, music and dialogue real enough. They actually convinced me – and this is a rarity, for me – that if I had believed in ghosts, etc, I would absolutely have fallen for the ruse the marketing team came up with. And perhaps, it would've been even more fun to watch it. But, then again, I'm really too smart for that.<br/><br/>Sadly, since, again, there has been countless, and mostly insipid found footage films since, if one were to watch this today, for the first time, they might be jaded and dislike it. I can dig that; but for those who pretty much started here, I'm sure there are more people that enjoyed this. For, I did love this movie and still today do.<br/><br/>Side Note: It helps I had/have a major crush on the actor and character ""Mike."" Now, I wouldn't have rated the movie higher just because of my attraction, but it sure as hell helped while watching this. Further, and again not a star up or down in my rating, I would've preferred in a movie that basically only featured THREE actors, that Mike would have been shown more. It seems like the percentage of on screen time: (the bitch) Heather: 40%, Josh: 35% and Mike: 25%. Oh, well; that's why they made pause."
"TrickyTheHorrorFreak","7","3","5","18 September 2006"," A unique study in terror that requires a little something from the viewer.
","I really wanted to love ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I went to see it at the cinemas. I'd read the Internet hype after it came out in the U.S. back when not everyone realized it was fake. The reviews called it ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist!"" and stories of people screaming and crying in the cinemas really brought my expectations up to an unattainable height. I'd talked it up to myself as well as to friends and colleagues, telling them all that they had to go see it when it came out. But by the time it actually hit our shores (I'm an Aussie), everyone had been made aware that it was fake and all the magic of early reports had been replaced by negativity and mocking. But I lined up, paid my cash and went in to find out what it was all about.<br/><br/>I must admit, that first sitting was the epitome of disappointment. The camera jumped all over the place and made me feel frustrated and a tad ill. The constant fighting of the characters got on my nerves more than a reality TV show. But the worst part of it was that I didn't find it at all to be scary. Here was this so-called holy grail of scary movies and people were actually laughing in the cinema rather than screaming. I walked out feeling completely let down after months of looking forward to the event.<br/><br/>A couple of years later I decided to watch the movie on DVD. I picked a cold, dark night, turned all the lights out, took the phone off the hook and sat down on the couch. I'd made the decision that I was going to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way the first viewers had seen it. Forgetting everything I'd ever heard about it, I would delve into it with a clean slate. I'm really glad I did! While I didn't completely freak out and lose my lunch in fear, I certainly found a new appreciation for it. In fact, if the viewer simply allows themselves to become involved in the situation on screen, it can become quite psychologically jarring. I really believe one of the reasons that so many hated the film, myself included, was due to both expectations and an inability to actually put themselves in the place of the actors. To actually experience the movie! It certainly didn't help that the audience I saw it with was laughing. If you can take that step, then ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very effective and clever film. So the question is, is it OK to ask the audience to commit so much of themselves to a film for them to be able to have an emotional reaction (other than boredom). The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is yes. The problem has been created over an extended period of time, with more and more blockbuster movies that require nothing of the audience whatsoever. No thought, no belief, no experienceÂ…nothing! That being the case, when a movie such as this one comes around, it's understandable that people may just find it boring as they have lost the ability to actually ""experience"" it or in some cases, simply choose not to let themselves.<br/><br/>No, I haven't done a complete turn around and gone from a Blair Witch basher to a Blair Witch lover. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The epileptic camera movements still make it hard to watch, the inability to hear what's going on in the forest and some of the bickering still gets on my nerves. But I must admit it all makes it far more realistic and it's all very intentional to get the desired effect. The acting is actually pretty damn good. The fact is that in all likeliness, normal people would fight and cry and scream and carry on exactly the same way these guys do. There are moments of absolute terror in their voices and sheer emotion on their faces which is a credit to the actors. I can't say there's anything I could suggest they should have done differently that would make it any more realistic than it is and for that reason alone I consider the movie to be a success. It is a movie to be experienced alone in the dark though. Nothing else would do it justice."

","Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's 'The Blair Witch Project' caused a sensation when released in 1999. It was the first movie to become a hit as the result of the internet, and deservedly so. The low budget horror movie is the perfect antidote to those formulaic Hollywood shockers in which nubile co-eds get chased by some knife-wielding idiot in a mask.<br/><br/>A group of students - Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C.Williams - venture into woods in Maryland to make a documentary about the notorious 'Blair Witch', a sorceress believed to have actually existed and been responsible for many deaths. At first, the assignment is fun, but then things go wrong; the map goes missing, they argue amongst themselves as to whose fault it was, and they cannot find their way back to Burdittville. Strange noises can be heard at night. Worst of all, peculiar stick figures are found. Something is out in the forest with them, watching their every move, but what? <br/><br/>As noted earlier, 'Project' was made on a very small budget. But for once this was an asset rather than a liability. So convincingly realistic did it turn out that cinema-goers thought they were watching a real video diary. The principal cast members give natural performances, particularly Donahue. For me, it brought back uncomfortable memories of camping with friends in the woods and being kept awake all night by owls and other nocturnal beasts! It owes a great debt to those eerie 'Ghost Stories For Christmas' made by the B.B.C. in the '70's, such as 'The Signalman'. It works as much on the imagination as on the senses. The film starts slowly, then ratchets up the tension so fast that by the end you're absolutely terrified. The ending is deliberately ambiguous. All we know is that the students were never found, and the film footage provides the only clue to their fate.<br/><br/>For a short time, it looked as though there was to be a major shift towards a more natural style of horror movie, but it does not seem to have happened. Many movies have copied the look of 'Project' - the quick-fire editing, the shaky camera-work - but alas not the feel.<br/><br/>There was a sequel - 'Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows' - made the following year, which was everything the first was not - uninspired and silly. If you're planning on going camping in woods, whatever you do, don't watch 'Project' the night before."

","This was one hard to watch movie.  I am a person who immerses myself in the story.  I don't turn the movie on the first time and begin my critique as many here have done. First watch it, then, later, return and blast it if you must.  I loved it. The idea is unique. The style is the annoying part, but, that is one of the things that makes this movie.  I found myself so wrapped up in this thing that I was yelling at the stupid characters in the film.  All they had to do was follow the creek down stream.. it is any woodsman's guaranteed method for getting ""un-lost"" (especially in slightly rural Maryland). What I enjoyed most was the intelligence of the director.  He didn't play the Hollywood game of showing us the horrifying monster.  Instead he let our minds do the work.  If you have imagination, you'll be frightened to death.  If you don't, you'll fall asleep or get motion sickness.  This was so much fun that I made my own, cheaper yet, spoof, and mine is funny, at least to me!  Enjoy and be brave.. not everything on screen has to be so glossy and predictable as a big budget Hollywood bore!"

","""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary.  A year later their footage was found."" <br/><br/>That is the making of a scary, intense, and sometimes even funny film.  The Blair Witch Project's notorious reputation precedes it and makes it quite possibly the most infamous movie ever produced.  It's also one of the most cheaply made, highest grossing, most parodied films of all time.  Most of those statements are made because of pure marketing genius.  The concept isn't quite as original as you'd like to believe.  It has been done before, but I don't think it has worked before.  Blair Witch ""borrows"" the mockumentary concept of The Last Broadcast and improves upon it three-fold. It's a great story with real characters in a real situation and how they deal with it.  It's all about realism.  To this very day, some people believe this actually happened.  I think that's where the hatred comes from; people don't like to be tricked.  Love it or hate it, you can't forget it. The Blair Witch Project IS a landmark horror film."

","The Blair Witch Project is not your average horror film. I did not expect it to be what it was like, which was bad and differently shot. But, the way this film is shot isn't bad at all, and the film is actually a great surprise!<br/><br/>The first few minutes are disorienting, deliberately shot with all the shakiness of raw footage from some backpacker's video diary. The actors, using their real names, swiftly establish soon-to-fray relationships: Heather (Donahue) is the director willing to suffer for her art who doesn't care if others suffer less willingly with her, cameraman Josh (Leonard) is the slacker-type along for the ride and sound technician Mike (Williams) is mostly concerned with making sure they get the rented equipment back on time. After interviewing a couple of locals about the legend, the foolhardy trio head into the woods, and everything starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is powerfully real, the performances are all very polished and excellent, Heather Donahue was amazing, she did not deserve her Razzie award, even though she got annoying, her performance still lives long in the memory. Mike Williams is frightfully good and Josh Leonard is towering. The directional debut from Edward Myrick and Eduardo Sachez leaves you wanting more, I can't wait until their next film. The screenplay is extremely unique and memorable, I have never seen a piece of writing that seems so realistic.<br/><br/>Chillingly memorable and stunningly filmed, The Blair Witch Project has made it's place in film history as one of the most haunting films ever made.<br/><br/>I rate The Blair Witch Project 8 out of 10."

It was obvious from the start that the film wasn't ""real"" because most people would have genuine believable fear and sadness when faced with death.<br/><br/>People say that the fear generated came from not seeing what the horrific things were.

","Allow me to offend some people by theorizing about the reason for the huge disparity in how people respond to the Blair Witch Project. Personally, I fell on the side that found it less scary, less interesting, and less exciting than watching grass grow.<br/><br/>People who have actually been in the woods before, and have some shred of self control, mental stability, and the ability to think rationally, will find it impossible to relate to the characters, and impossible to share in their terror. If, on the other hand, you were raised as a spoiled, emotional moron, whose experience of nature consists of occasionally flipping past the nature channel with your cable remote, the movie might scare you ... not because it's actually scary, or because anything actually happens in the movie, but because your own imagination might manage to scare you all by itself.

","""We are going to die out here."" <br/><br/>Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since ""The Blair Witch Project"" was all the buzz, revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers, causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying, skakey camera work(..but, if you think about it, this only gives this piece merit, these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement), and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real, that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit. Watching it for the first time since, hell, 2000 I guess, I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps. It was as if I were with them, deep into the woods lost, the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me. I envisioned just what it would be like, there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance, even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine..particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent. I mean, snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies. At first, I could understand how three film students, Heather, Josh, & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill..it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say B- to possibly a B+. This documentary, as seen early on, seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods. It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it, providing our students with fuel for later laughter. I enjoyed how, as this continues, the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule. I found this actually rather believable and realistic, it worked for me. I could see a couple of people I either barely know, or know just from reputation, getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening. These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen. Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help. The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera. I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain. I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion, but this sure worked for me..I mean just think about it for a minute:lost in the woods, sounds and voices in the distance, you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods, one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness, and rocks(..not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin, neatly intertwined within sticks, cloth & string)formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone. It sure would have me peeing in my pants."

I saw this in the theater the first night it opened surrounded by little 15 and 16 year old teenyboppers who shouldn't even be allowed in R-rated movies. Don't theaters enforce this policy anymore?? This movie is extremely boring and it drags on way too long. The jumping camera made me nauseous and I was ready to walk out. Fortunately, the film mercifully ended to a loud chorus of boos. Perhaps one of the most overrated films in American cinema history. Don't waste your time on this. The three main actors are annoying, the story is lame and boring.

"Quagmar","Null","4","8","27 October 1999"," I gave it a second chance...Yup, I hate it
","Straight out of the Valencia Community College film lab, it's the most famous home movie not featuring Pamela Anderson. I know I don't need to explain the details of The Blair Witch Project, so I will instead focus upon the polarized opinions about it. I did not like this movie at all, but the wide variance in thoughts about it led me to give it a second chance on my home theater system. The few redeeming qualities I forced myself to find were not nearly enough to compensate for the poor overall experience this movie delivers. I will explain the reasons why I do not like it, but I first must comment on what a lot of the positive comments about Blair Witch have been mentioning. Every person is entitled to an opinion, even if that opinion is grossly uninformed and illogical. We all know this. But DO NOT tell me why I don't like this movie. The basic premise of defending The Blair Witch Project is, ""The only reason you don't like this movie is because there aren't any ILM FX, or blood and gore, or big scary monsters in state-of-the-art rubber suits."" There are a lot of people who don't care about those elements in a film that still did not like this particular movie. And, please, don't tell me this is cutting-edge material. If that were true, I would pull out some of the movies we made as kids out of the closet and advertise them as ""breakthrough filmmaking"". We ran around in the woods with a camcorder...could the right advertising make us millionaires too? Anyway... The main reason I disliked this movie (disregarding the obvious personal economic waste it created) was the horrid acting. You won't be seeing any of these actors on ""Whose Line Is It, Anyway?"" anytime soon, unless that show changes it format to screaming and cussing ad nauseum. The motivations behind the character actions were highly questionable at best, which easily transitions into bad dialogue. The movie creates no sympathy for the plight of these whiny, arrogant, silly college students. I was hoping for the visceral thrill of having the Blair Witch appear and stick a bunch of rocks in their mouths, but, alas, no such luck. Sticks and stones...now that I think about, I have solved the mystery of the Blair Witch, right here, sitting on my butt in front of the computer 2000 miles away from Maryland. Sticks tied together. Piles of rocks. Little handprints all over the walls of a house. Middle of the woods. The Blair Witch is (drum roll): Boy Scout Troop 529. You heard it here first."

By half way through the movie I wanted to kill the students.<br/><br/>This movie is about 90 minutes of pure crap.  It had a great marketing campaign, but that's about it.  There is no real story, per se, just the stupid students swearing, bickering, and whining like babies.  Not to mention the fact how totally IMPLAUSIBLE their situation is.  They are supposed to lost in a forest in MARYLAND... the state isn't big enough to get lost in!!!!  If it was the middle of northern Ontario, then *MAYBE* it would have been more plausible.  All they had to do was pick one direction and walk in it, or follow the river downstream... they would have eventually (and probably within a couple of hours) found civilization.  And one of the students throws away the map... and they even had a compass!  By using the river, there would have been NO CHANCE of them walking in circles.  And ooooo scary piles of rocks, noises, and twigs in the trees... gimme a break. I've seen kids at summer camp make scarier things in arts and crafts and heard scarier stories by the campfire!  As I said earlier, I wanted the students to die (or kill them myself) because they were so STUPID!  If this were real, and they did REALLY die... good riddance and thanks for improving the gene pool.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THE HYPE ON THIS MOVIE!

","The Blair Witch Project is possibly the most cleverly-crafted, gripping, suspenseful film ever made. I mean that with passion. This is truly a landmark of a film. The documentary feel of it all, the amazing camera-work. It captures every single little aspect of the dark, woods, of anything that has ever happened to be scary at all. It creates a perfect chilling atmosphere to the film. I mean, it is just so great how in horror films, we don't need to see senseless gore or the villains or evil. This film relies on truly just the situations and surroundings and characters. This is certainly an approach that I truly respect. Not many simply-shot films work, this could not have worked, but it did. It also happened to work because of all it's realism. Just three untrained actors working. I found all of them perfect. They did not seem to act, they just seemed as normal, and very realistic, which after all did help this film. I also always wondered how people in horror films should truly act in real life. Well, this is possibly the only film that really feels like it is a real-life experience. I also think that the writing, the dialogue, really was very strong. It was not just because of the camera, but it also added to the complete realism. The Blair Witch Project is definitely a film that stands out in every aspect."

","The Blair Witch Project is a very interesting film, and I've always struggled with how to rate this one. Technically the acting is bad and camera work is shoddy, but there's just something about it that makes it difficult to stop watching.<br/><br/>Obviously it kicked off the now massive found-footage genre, and genuinely this is probably one of the better ones, the plot is fairly good and mysterious; and the location being set in a woods is spooky and fantastic. The surroundings and camera work make you feel as if you're actually there, experiencing every twig snap and the wind smack your face as you trudge on.<br/><br/>So why do I rate it only 6/10? Because, unfortunately, it is very boring!! Especially on a second viewing, the ""Witch"" never even bothers to show her face, and the scares are mostly left up to our imagination (not necessarily a bad thing), actually at times I see this film as art, other times I don't.<br/><br/>6/10: Despite the relatively average rating of a 6, (due to bad acting and boredom), this is something you really need to watch and experience. So I 100% recommend giving it a try, you may love it or hate it, but it sure is an experience nonetheless!"

I know that in the story the kids were filming, and I did accept that all the camera job were shaky and my stomac went upside down even in front of my tv screen.

EDIT
It was a bold movie that forever changed the way that movies were made. That's the line that we are often told about this movie and its mostly correct. It was somewhat bold, the idea of lost footage was not new, but it somehow caught the imagination of the public. It came out during a time when the genre of horror was starting to be reborn. The late 80's into the early 90's saw horror slip into one unforgettable trash movie after another. Then came Scream and everything changed. By the time this movie came around the public was ready for something new and they got it.<br/><br/>The movie honestly is not that great. It has a somewhat weak story that would make for a great book more then a great movie. Something is out in the forrest and a group of filmmakers go out to do a documentary about it. The acting is all around awful at times. We don't see much of anything and the ending left so many wanting more. And that I think is the key to this movie. It gave us just enough that left us hungry for more. We wanted it to be real. Sure it was not the first movie to have the idea, but it was a movie that tapped into the public's love for lore of the unknown. We knew that it was not real but what if.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if horror movies will ever go away. People love them and they make a lot of money for those in Hollywood. Scream night have awoken our current love of horror movies but it was in Blair Witch that it went from a killer with a knife to a force that you couldn't hide from.<br/><br/>So should you see this? Yes. At least once. It took me almost 20 years to watch it. Was it great? No but it was still creepy. I happen to love folklore and then ideas in this movie tapped beautifully into that idea that there are things we can not explain. Watch it and then go camping and tell me that it doesn't make you stay up all night."

","Compelling and eerie found footage movie about a trio of amateur filmmakers who disappear after hiking into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A modern classic that helped usher in that particular subgenre of horror we have today. Most found footage movies are absolutely terrible and can't hold a candle to this one. It's probably the only movie of its type that ever seemed remotely authentic to me, even though I knew it was all fiction. At the time, people debated whether or not this was actually real. That seems silly, of course, but I knew several people back then who believed what they saw on the screen really happened. A lot of the credit for that should go to the actors, particularly Heather Donahue, for doing such a great job of making it seem believable. I just saw it for the first time in probably a decade or more and, while it doesn't hold the same impact as it did initially, it's still a remarkably well-done low-budget psychological horror movie.<br/><br/>Yes the movie was heavily hyped but it was deserved, in my opinion. This was a huge box office success built largely on word of mouth which is a testament to its quality. Sadly, because of its popularity, a lot of people bashed the film (and still do, judging by some of these reviews). If by some chance you have never seen this movie, please ignore the haters and give it a fair shot. I know that, after so many found footage horror movies since it was released, it won't seem as fresh. But I think if you drown out the background noise of the whiners and allow yourself to become immersed in the story, you'll find this movie is one of the best of its kind and worthy of praise."

"mylucylumpkins","9","2","3","7 September 2014"," What do I like to do on Sundays? Watch horror films from my childhood!
","The reason I enjoyed this film in it original theatrical release and continue to enjoy it today can be summed up by one childhood story. A friend at the time had an uncle who was on the police force. After we saw the film and debated about its authenticity he claimed that, although we live no where close to where the film takes place, he had seen the official police records of this incident. He was a police officer and I had no reason to doubt him, but it was really the film that sold me on the idea that it was all found footage and that these folks were really dead. <br/><br/>Of course latter I realized the truth, but to be caught in the Blair Witch whirlwind was fantastic! People always try to look back at the excitement they had for this film, and others like it, and belittle the film because of the hype. This film really did live up to the hype for me. Of course there were problems, but it was the first successful film of it's kind. I still feel like it is the best found footage film to date and I can attribute some of that to the hype surrounding it. <br/><br/>Just to point out a few things to address common issues with the film: the acting is exactly where it should be. These people are clearly not reading from a script, and although people criticize their improvisational skills, they are believable as average people. Another issue that people have is that a person being so concerned with getting lost kicks the map into the river. He gives a very valid human explanation, the map wasn't doing anything to help them, and he just got mad and kicked it into the stream. Of course it was stupid, but for that reason I find it believable. The last is the idea that when in trouble, people will stop filming and the fact that the whole thing is supposedly on film is ridiculous. My answer to this is simple, people film life threatening situations so that if they survive they have proof and can relive it. If you don't believe me, look into how many people film tsunamis, or tornadoes, or robberies, or anything else that may have killed them."

","***CAUTION:SPOILER ALERT***The Blair's Witch Project was fantastic but very scary. I am 13 and just watched it nonstop on netflix with no interruptions. I admit I may be too young but I've seen many scary and adult movies. Pulp Fiction The Green Mile The first 3 screams Interview with a vampire The shining and many more I cant think of off the top of my head. But this is a whole new level of creepy. When I put it in I was expecting ghostbusters not Halloween meets jack Nicholson's crazy behavior in the shining meets jaws (when they don't show the witch and the directors skill) When they mentioned it on Dawsons Creek for that one episode I thought maybe it wouldn't be that bad I mean I had gotten to find out about and see Jerry Maguire its a wonderful life and close encounters of the third kind from that show. My mother said it wasn't too bad she just got dizzy from the cameras. ***SPOILER STARTS ABOUT HERE***I did expect it to start off worse but it was pretty calm with the hotel and the interviews. But that just made it better it got my guard down making me expect it to be sorta like that even though in the back of my head I knew it would get worse. And it certainly did. From they left the car it got frightening. The noises in the night especially when they found the rocks. But the worst meaning scary nothing was bad was the bundle. I expected it to just be a piece of josh's clothing when I saw the plaid. But then I heard blood and thought it might be some of his blood what came next I never would have expected. It was body parts like what I thought was a thumb or tooth maybe both and nose. Even that was mild compared to what was coming. The baby crying were nothing compared to josh screaming. Just writing about this freaks me out. From all the seasons of supernatural I've seen I know running into the woods never ends well especially one with a legend of a possessing killer witch 10000000 times worse than the one of the west. My anxiety worsens when I see the old burnt house with symbols and children's handprints on the walls possibly bloody. And just when I don't think it could get even scarier they go into the basement. I was aorta expecting it and aorta not. I remembered the part of the man possessed to kill children in his basement and make one look in the corner while he kills the other and then takes the one in the corner out once hes done and kills that one as well. Once I saw the handprints I thought I kind of knew what was coming but wasn't sure. Once I saw the basement I knew what I signed up for a haunting thrill ride I will never forget. I honestly didn't expect such of a creepy ending I thought I wouldn't get too frightened and would continue my life with another classic under my belt. But. instead I got a whole bother experience. Sorry of I built it up too much even though hopefully if your reading this you've already seen this. You see Mike standing facing the corner not moving to heather's screams. Then you see the camera fall to the ground film for a few more seconds until credits appear. I am proud to say I understood the connection the second I saw Mike. I am not proud to say I have never been this scared in my life. Incoviniently on a school night and its almost 11:40. I really hope parents wont allow their child to watch this. I'm 13 and I've seem many scary things.Butafterseeing this I'm ready to jump in bed with my father. I certainly thought I would come out of this unscathed but I am jumping at every noise (doesn't help I have cats) and I cant turn off the light let alone sleep and from what I've heard many grown adult have done the same maybe even worse. Its up to you but I strongly advise you to have only adults watch it unless parents want them sleeping with them until the kids 17 (no exaggeration) they should refrain from letting them watch it. But as I said earlier its your call. I have a feeling I will be mortified for a long time. Most readers may think Imjust a kid who got scared from a little horror movie so if you doubt me watch it inahouse with many windows and a doer connecting to a porch right next to it. At 9:00 To 10:00 with no lights on all alone then tell me its just me when people over 20 years old are totally freaked out.

"Bonehead-XL","7","2","3","27 March 2014"," A Perfectly Plausible Urban Legend
","Upon release in 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was immediately declared a horror classic. The film was a huge sleeper hit and remains one of the highest grossing independent films to this day. Much of the film's box office success can be contributed to its brilliant marketing campaign. Through a then innovative website (which, charmingly, remains up and mostly unchanged to this day), the studio convinced countless people that the film was genuine. That the footage of three college students entering the woods, attempting to make a documentary about a local legend, and mysteriously disappearing, was the real deal. I wasn't fooled at the time, recognizing it as the clever marketing ploy it was, but many of my middle school classmates were. After the hype wore off, a backlash quickly kicked in, many derisively describing ""The Blair Witch Project"" as ""eighty minutes of jerks wandering around the woods."" Nearly fifteen years later, after hundreds of found footage films have followed in its wake, how does the film hold up? That the film managed to fool so many is a testament to the believable mythology it builds up over its brief run time. The legend of the Blair Witch is surprisingly detailed. The metafictional device is furthered by setting the story in a real town, Burkittsville, Maryland. Though completely invented, the Blair Witch seems like a perfectly plausible urban legend. Numerous missing children over the years are connected to the story. In the forties, a serial killer blamed his murders on the witch. The three filmmakers visit a local nut, Mary Brown, who claims to have encountered the witch. In the early scenes, local people from the town are interviewed, each giving their own opinion and stories on the legend. We are shown Coffin Rock and its gory story is related to us. In practice, the Blair Witch isn't any different then the Bell Witch, Mothman, the Bunnyman or any other real life urban legends.<br/><br/>The success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is built mostly on the unsettling atmosphere it generates. The film begins with white-on-black title card, letting us know that the three kids don't make it out of the woods. This information lends many of the early scenes a quiet unease. Even when Heather, Josh, and Mike are goofing off, we know dark times lay ahead for them. The movie takes the woods setting a long way. Though frequently parodied in the years since, the scenes of the three kids running blind through the dark woods, listening for strange noises, still have the power to chill. These scenes are low-tech, relying on nothing but the real fears of the viewers and the actor's terrified performances.<br/><br/>What engineered horror elements ""The Blair Witch Project"" does have are equally subtle. Throughout the film, the campers make strange discoveries. First, they find strange piles of rocks outside their tents. Infamously, they come upon bizarre stick figures hanging in the trees. One of the highlights of the movie is, after Josh's disappearance, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks filled with bloody bits of flesh. Donahue's panicked performance really sells that moment.<br/><br/>The common complaint of ""jerks lost in the woods"" certainly does hold some water. Long scenes in the middle section are composed of the characters wandering around, yelling at each other. While it certainly adds to the film's tone of desperation and a few moments, such as a revelation concerning some downed logs, prove effective. However, this part of the movie goes on for far too long. As short as it is, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is truthfully a little long and probably would have been best served as an hour long short.<br/><br/>The ending makes up for a lot though. The survivors stumble into a strange house in the middle of the forest. The ending is notorious and well known. It's also incredibly stark. The viewer is left with no answers, the mystery maintained. First time viewers might not even catch why Josh is facing the wall in the basement, a reference to the earlier legend. The effect is intensely creepy, the found footage illusion maintained until the end credits roll.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" was a true pop culture phenomenon and that's honestly sort of surprising. I'd never expect a film as low-key or divisive to resonate with so many people. Maybe the internet campaign really caught everyone's attention, even those who knew the movie was fiction. The movie spawned a television special, several books, comics, collectible figures, a much-contested sequel, even a series of computer games. Yet its biggest influence was on the horror genre. It took about another decade for found footage to really catch on, hundreds of copy cats following in the wake of the wildly successful ""Paranormal Activity"" series. Every notable title in the sub-genre to come, from ""Cloverfield"" to the ""Marble Hornets"" web series, owes something to ""The Blair Witch Project."""

","Literally the worst movie I've seen thus far, and that includes screening for undergrad film majors. <br/><br/>What are you people thinking giving this high ratings? Let me break it down. <br/><br/>""You had to have an imagination/it's all left up to the imagination."" Okay, so yeah, it's supposed to be psychologically scary. It's a little difficult to be lost in your inner fears with Heather screaming like a self-centered crazy woman. Seriously, shut up. If she would have been even a tiny bit less annoying, it'd have been easier to go into the ""...what if...""'s that my mind wanted to throw out there. Make Josh disappear sooner and perhaps have him scream every night for two nights or more. That's the only part in the movie when I was a little scared. What happened to Josh? Why is he yelling? AH!But we never know, and the mind takes it to the goriest, most painful experience imaginable. Only well-done part of the movie. <br/><br/>""The editing was spot on/first person camera is so immersive!"" I'm sorry, but what person jiggles and shakes around that much when walking in the woods? Try it. When you walk, your vision does wobble a bit, but not in the nausea-inducing way the cameras do in BWP. I didn't feel like I was there, I felt like I had a migraine coming on. I get it, it's supposed to be that the viewer found the footage in the woods. But... it didn't feel like that. For that to happen, I would have preferred a police officer or something to introduce us to the footage, not just a black screen and words.<br/><br/>""The ending was so scary/the locals built suspense!"" It wasn't suspenseful. The moment it was mentioned how the kids were killed, we all knew what was going to happen. Seriously people. NOT SUSPENSEFUL. <br/><br/>""The acting was so honest/believable/ad hoc!"" Cut out Heather. Just get a new actor, she isn't believable as a person, an actor, or a character. About as ""deeply sorry"" as Hitler. Annoying enough to make me WANT her to die. Incessant talking? No. Just, no. Stop. And the way all the actors sort of faced each other awkwardly like a school play for a good majority of the film? Unprofessional and not believable one bit. They didn't work together one bit. <br/><br/>Just burn it, and start over."

","The Blair Witch Project is probably the worse horror film ever made. It's basically 5 idiotic teenagers who are stupid enough to go into a dark wood, camp, lose their map and not find a way home. It's so predictable, all the way through.... It's just boring, only the least 15 minutes has a tiny bit of action in and it's pathetic. The acting is terrible and this is NOT footage. How they can try to say it is... It's OBSCENE. I really didn't enjoy this film, it was a waste of £4.00 and I don't understand how Shrooms has the cheek to say that Blair Witch is like Shrooms on Acid. It really isn't. Shrooms actually scares you and the horror is sustained.

Fortunately i am not one of those people. this film is up their with the contenders of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I respect the fact that they tried summing new with a hand-held camera and to their credit it has not been used all that much in horror films during that time period. It tried being a horror film, however the film was a horror show rather than horror film. one of the main reasons i dislike this film is because its one big anti climax and the concluding part of the film is laughable.<br/><br/>if you wanna watch a descent hand held film watch paranormal activity it much better and way more interesting than this. I dread to think what the Blairwitch 2 is like."
"sddavis63","7","2","3","7 November 2009"," Imaginative And Pretty Effective
","Although the style has become fairly common, at the time this movie was released, the idea of a simple movie filmed in a documentary style using a single hand held camera was pretty imaginative, and to give the makers of this film their proper credit, no one since has mastered the raw style as effectively. The story is a simple one. Three college students learn of a Maryland legend about the “Blair Witch” and they set out for a weekend in the woods to investigate the stories.<br/><br/>The film starts out in a light-hearted manner, showing the trio joking around as they prepare for their adventure, then doing some background interviews with residents of the nearby town of Burkittsville, which adds some horror-type mystery and “history” to the project. There wasn't much excitement in that opening, but it established that the three didn't take the legends seriously and that they weren't expecting much more than a weekend in the woods. At first we watch essentially a routine nature hike, but the suspense builds pretty quickly once the three realize they're lost. Then they begin to hear mysterious sounds at night and stumble upon strange things by day - unusual rock piles, and the now famous Blair Witch symbol made out of sticks and hanging from trees. The movie never tries to explain these things, focusing instead on the increasing terror felt by the campers. There's an interesting study of group dynamics as the three respond to their plight by increasingly turning on each other. The climax of the movie starts when Josh goes missing. He's nowhere to be found, but Heather and Bill hear him calling to them. Their search finally leads them unexpectedly to a crumbling old house. There's something terrifying in the house, but it's never revealed, the filming stopping suddenly when Heather comes across Bill staring at something. In the story, the three are never found, but the camera and film are found a year later.<br/><br/>I realize this was in keeping with the genre, but I would have liked a bit more resolution. The movie leaves you with your heart pumping but no explanation of what happened. Still, the film is effective at building suspense and presents a frighteningly creepy feel once the kids realize that they're lost, and the three do a great job of portraying their increasing fear and desperation. The college documentary project angle also shields the film from the typical, ”low budget"" criticisms. Altogether, it's pretty effective. 7/10"

"SteakSalad_101","1","2","3","22 April 2008"," By far...the worst horror movie I've ever seen
","I very, very rarely write reviews for films that I don't see in the theater. However, this is a gross exception. Now you may think I am writing this review because the film I saw was a spectacular piece of cinema, something worth drooling over, spending $20 on and watching every Friday night with a different group of friends. But noI am writing this review to tell you that if you ever so much as THINK of seeing it, I strongly recommend you to reconsider your decision.<br/><br/>Those who know me, know I love a scary film. The original 'Saw' is the only horror movie I have seen that managed to scare me. I picked up The Blair Witch Project after it had been called the scariest film since the Exorcist, genuinely frightening, and among other critics' ravings, I knew I had to give it a shot. So I made myself some tea, some popcorn, and sat down in the middle of the night and put it into my DVD player to watch on my big projection screen TV. All alone with the Blair Witch Project. Some may say, quite a daring thing to do! I may say, quite a laughable thing to do. (that is, laughable in the sense of me thinking I actually was going to be scared.) The Blair Witch Project is 87 minutes of pieces of footage collected by three young adults who go filming a documentary on the Blair Witch legend deep in the woods of Maryland. After interviewing several locals about the legend, they trudge into the woods, only to become horribly lost. They begin seeing strange thingssticks that look like witches, babies crying out in the middle of the night, rocks that magically appear in piles outside their campsyou know. The stuff from your absolute scariest nightmares.<br/><br/>So basically we have these three stupid people who DON'T stop cursing (130 F-bombs in one film) and these poor souls just can't find their way out of the woods. About 75% of the film is made up of footage of these people crossing streams while saying ""turnip! I hope I don't fall!"" and ""I thought we already WERE traveling south!"" The other 25% is made up of them crying during the night in their camps saying ""Jesus kissing Christ, what the kissing turnip was that?! turnip!"" While leaves rustle outside, rocks fall, and voices murmur. Then the morning comes. And they go back to crossing streams. Except this time, their map is gone. Ooh! The Blair Witch took the map! Getting scary, eh? Yeah, right. Then the night comes again. More ""turnip! ITS BACK! turnip! WHERE THE turnip IS JOSH?! turnip!"" Then the morning comes.you get the idea.<br/><br/>I kept thinking ""This has GOT to get scarier, maybe the film hasn't gotten going yet."" I was saying that throughout the whole film. I was even saying it during the final scene, and then the credits came up, and I was like WTF? Is there more? Wow, guess not. To be honest, that's what the Blair Witch Project is. And I'm not being funny or making it seem dumb for the sake of this review's successI'm being completely serious.<br/><br/>All three of the people are laughable. Heather Donahue, who is an actress I love the work of, is the only one who seems mildly genuinely unsettled. The other two just scream like idiots. And then more F-bombs are dropped. Give me a BREAK already.<br/><br/>So yeah. Then we get to the final scenethey find a house in the woods. Pretty scary. They go in, they hear screams in the basement, and their cameras drop. THE END! Roll credits. I was thinking to myself, ""They just used an hour and a half of camera time for something that could've been shown in literally five minutes."" Now, I am not saying that the three people in this situation weren't scared, or wouldn't be scared. It's a pretty creepy set-up. But watching it on a screen? Bleh. It's just three stupid people who can't get out of the woods and who scream and curse at random noises they encounter. Last night I had a dream Nathan Radley from To Kill A Mockingbird snuck into my house, hacked my computer, and stole my kitchen table. And even that was scarier than this terrible movie. I'm not trying to be funny either.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion: mix three stupid people, a big woods, 130 F-bombs, and a bunch of weird noises that don't make sense, and you've got yourself The Blair Witch Project. I mean come ongimme a break. Or, better yet, give YOURSELF a breakand never see this movie.<br/><br/>Come on, filmmakers! Give me another 'Saw' to scare me! This is your best shot?"

The obvious switching between one camera to another without breaking audio leads one easily to conclude that. Not only that, but where was the extra juice for all the video they took? Going into the woods and being followed by someone or something. That is not scary. Sometimes the people argue with one another and improv, which was funny at one point.

However, as all you horror heads out there know, you put yourself through this to discover that 5% of gold that gets released so rarely.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a very welcome addition to that 5%. An ingenious idea well executed has produced one of the scariest experiences this 30 something year old has endured. Thanks to this film I am now officially scared of the dark and not ashamed to admit it.<br/><br/>The uneasiness began to creep in when the locals were telling their tales of the Blair Witch legend, particularly the crazy old lady with her ""fur"" story. The documentary style was maintained with absolute perfection and hats off to the film makers for showing discipline and sticking to their original idea throughout.<br/><br/>The woods are beautifully eerie, the soundtrack of indecipherable sounds, events that keep getting stranger and more terrifying as the film rolls on and the growing sense of desperation and hopelessness finally brings us to the perfect climax set in that run down house that is the stuff of my nightmares.<br/><br/>I truly don't believe I'll ever be able to re-create the real terror I felt at the first viewing of this film and now I'm doomed to walk the earth fruitlessly trying for the rest of my days."
"JimRaynor55","1","2","3","9 October 2006"," Massively Overrated Tripe
","The Blair Witch Project is not the brilliant film that it was hailed as by the critics when it first came out. No, instead it's a uniquely-made (not necessarily a good thing) movie that just had masterful marketing. Before it came out, many people honestly believed that it was real. Even after they learned it was not, they were still intrigued by the eerie advertisements and the unique premise. Coming out in 1999 amid the backlash against of big-budget, visual FX-heavy blockbusters like Godzilla (1998) and The Phantom Menace also likely benefited this low-budget film.<br/><br/>I'm not some stupid kid looking for tons of ridiculous gore in a horror movie. I can understand the idea that sometimes ""it's what you don't see that scares you."" However, I also believe that you do have to see SOMETHING, even if it's just a little, to be scared.<br/><br/>All this movie shows is a trio of stupid kids running around lost in the woods. Occasionally they freak out after hearing spooky sounds, that's basically it. Oh yeah, at one point they find a bunch of little wooden arts and crafts hung on some tree branches. Real scary.<br/><br/>The plot is nonexistent, as is the backstory (I hear it's provided in a sequel which dispensed with the unique first-person video camera perspective, and was just a plain old crappy horror movie). You NEVER learn what the Blair Witch is, or even if that's what's behind the things that go on in the movie.<br/><br/>The characters are stupid and unlikable kids. I heard that the no-name actors were told to improvise their scenes, to make things more ""realistic."" Believe me, it shows. There's an entire scene where the three characters do nothing but scream ""F*** you!"" This movie which supposedly reinvigorated the sagging horror genre is completely overrated. There's not a single real scare in it, and the story and writing is pathetic. Save yourself the time and rental fees by passing on this film."

","OK, I'll go step by step to tell you just how bad this thing really is.<br/><br/>Camera Work: Horrible! The camera shakes every second! It's so annoying and you can't really see what's going on. Most of the time you'll be skipping parts because of a black screen. You'll wonder: ""Is this important or can I just skip this part?"" <br/><br/>Acting: The acting is just screaming and yelling and arguing and that kind of stuff. But do these people really need to put a swear word into almost every sentence?<br/><br/>Sound: What sound? There is no music except at the end and on the DVD. But it's so stupid. Seriously, the opening sound on the DVD sounds like someone turned up the volume of a keyboard as high as it would go and then sat on it. The music at the end sounds like a dog and a cat ran across the keyboard.<br/><br/>Story: OK, so there are 3 kids who go off into the woods to make a documentary about some witch or something. One of the kids gets lost or something. I don't really know what happens to him. So they spend some 3 days in the woods then they go to this house but then the one guy gets lost. The girl finds him like standing in a corner or something. What is he doing in the corner anyway? He's just standing there and the girl flips out and the camera lands on the ground. Wow....<br/><br/>Overall: I don't understand why people sometimes force themselves to watch bad movies. Most likely because they want to see if it's worth the 6-8 dollars they shelled out. In the case of the Blair Witch project: To stop watching this film should require as much strength and intelligence as breaking a potato chip. It's BAD. DO NOT WATCH IT. WATCH IT ONCE AND YOU WILL BE HAUNTED FOR LIFE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT IS!!!! How can a movie just be that bad? It's inhuman! Do not watch it if you value your eyes and ears."

My guess is that most watched it at home with the lights on and a couple of their friends near by. This is a scary and innovative movie. What makes it scary is that it is different from 99% of other horror movies. In most standard horror movies you have a Freddy or Jason to embody terror or evil. You see Michael Myers an you know he is evil and supposed to be scary. However, real terror is terror you cannot see and that is what is so brilliant about this film. The Blair Witch is a mystery and she leaves our imagination to decide so much. I am a creative person with quite the imagination.

","The Blair Witch Project is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of clever use of minimal resources, hype, selective leakage of information and superb disinformation that made a film that cost a pittance into a spectacular success.  It did this not by trying to defy its humble origins but indeed it played on them in the most effective way;  it used its amateur feel and low budget appearance to make it look all the more real and this was backed up by hyping people into believing that it was indeed real (at least for a time).<br/><br/>Even when they realised that they had been `duped' so to speak they were intrigued (as was I) to find how this had been done to so many people so effectively.  The film came out very late in Australia (so we could cop the 2nd hand prints from the US) but I had purchased it on DVD from the US about two months before its theatrical release and had read a great deal about it and the hype surrounding it before even I saw it.<br/><br/>It was intriguing to note the trickle of broken information that made it even here, others had heard this or that about this new film and many even believed it to be real - the thing was everyone wanted to see it very badly.<br/><br/>Not everyone who saw it was effected by it - some didn't get it, some didn't like it, some weren't scared by it (one friend of mine borrowed the DVD and she watched it at midday with the lights all on and the windows open cuddled up with her border collie on the sofa;  she deliberately tried to minimise the scare impact, I tend to show it with all the lights off and around midnight!).<br/><br/>Others had heard too much real information for the hype to have worked properly - but that's ok, I watched the film to see what they had tried to do and how they had tried to do it and I was enormously impressed by how someone took what they had and used simplicity and ingenuity to make something work so well.<br/><br/>This is a film that is special in many ways, like Orson Wells' radio play of `War of the Worlds' and even Ghostwatch (1992) on the BBC, this film can lull the viewer into a sense of what they are seeing is real and even if you know it isn't in the proper environment it can still send chills down one's spine and leave the shattered illusions in their mind for days afterwards. It works on a minimalist approach not widely seen for a long time and they do it very very well;  indeed this was the first DVD I ever purchased and it is still one of my favourites.<br/><br/>Not only is it a different type of horror film - it's a different type of film all together (from almost everything else I've seen) and in this day and age of repetition that's quite an achievement.<br/><br/>It's a shame the sequel was just so bloody awful, it had none of the feeling or atmosphere of the original."

","A real horror film is always primarily about the psychology of fear, which leaves the movie maker with one key decision: how much to show, and how much to leave only in the mind.  'The Blair Witch Project' exists as the video diaries of some self-obsessed film-makers, making a film about themselves investigating the legend of a local witch.  As well as being an interesting experiment in narrative legitimacy, it also provides a novel solution to the aforementioned dilemma: we see exactly what the characters see for themselves.  It's convincingly done, and truly spine-chilling.  The ""heroes"" are annoying American brats, but as their plight deepens, one is taken with the sense that they're going to die.  The result is harrowing, and more resembles the BBC's story of nuclear winter, 'Threads', than any conventional horror film.  Not exactly light entertainment, but genuinely good nonetheless."
"Mr_Mirage","10","2","3","28 August 2003"," This is the future.
","While many deride this film as empty, or less than entertaining, the fact remains, like it or not: This is the future of filmmaking. Period.<br/><br/>If you hate or loathe this film, all I can say is: do it yourself, do better. Like it or not, the makers of BWP have pointed the way. Anyone with access to a digital camera, computer and a simple editing program has the capacity to make a film.<br/><br/>This particular piece, so roundly trashed by many, does have its own, odd, quirky points, moments that stand out and are now part of the horror iconography. <br/><br/>While the detractors moan and groan, a simple tale from my own experience explains why I love this odd little thing.<br/><br/>One of my supervisors overheard me enthusing about BWP. He chided me, as I am sure so many others will, about how ""bad"" the film was, how ""stupid"" and simply not scary. He went on in detail, and I responded simply ""to each their own,"" or some such. A few seconds afterwards, though, he pulled me aside and asked:<br/><br/>""It wasn't ... REAL... was it?""<br/><br/>See, one of the greatest things about BWP is its simplicity.<br/><br/>
Once upon a time, two boys and a girl went into the dark forest, and were never heard from again. <br/><br/>The stuff whispered around campfires, or cautionary tales told by grandmothers to correct the unruly child... the power is in the simplicity.<br/><br/>Would that Hollywood could see the point... but I fear they are blinded to it... I have hope, though, because, as mentioned above, this is the future, I have the technology, and I can do it myself, should I so choose... I would invite anyone that hates this film to see if they can do better, not so much as a throw down challenge, but rather as a simple desire to see what others can do with such limited resources."

","This is by far the best horror movie I have ever seen. It's very original, and everything looks REAL. That's what makes it so great.<br/><br/>This is the perfect proof that you can really create some scary sh*t even without special effects, or clever camera work, or hideous monsters.<br/><br/>
Three students go deep in the woods to make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. They disappeared... and the footage was found a year later. The movie is actually a documentary-style presentation of what the kids have filmed during their quest.<br/><br/>So... everything's filmed on 16 mm, with cameras held by the actors. First, they interview some people in the village next to the forest the Witch is supposed to be in. And then they go deep in the forest. Only to get lost.<br/><br/>
So. There are NO effects. No monsters. No witches, or killings, or horrifying images. There are 2 handy cams, held by the actors, and nothing else.<br/><br/>Still, throughout the whole movie, your heart beats like crazy.<br/><br/>
What makes this so scary? Maybe just the fact that it DOESN'T have effects. So it all looks real. Or the documentary-style. The noises in the night. Their discoveries. When they get lost, the forest looks haunting. And - honestly - whenever there was night, I kept hoping dawn will kick in soon.<br/><br/>
This is an amazing movie. Vote: 10 out of 10."

","First of all I saw it only gets a 6+ on imdb, I can completely understand this, because this movie has a typical awsome or awfull feeling on people. Also I wanna say it's not a movie for film critics who judge on the story, directing etc..., it's not a movie like shawshank redemption or american beauty with an brilliant plot and meaning... This is a film to get u completely into the atmosphere of ""the unknown"", not a movie where the storie grabs u with your throat, the atmosphere, the feeling of being there yourself does this. Therefore many people will think it sux, because of the meaningless things you see on the screen. On the other hand I personally think this movie is pure class, the hype around it makes this movie certainly ""better"", just the thought ""did this really happened?"" grabs you, at least me. If u start watching the movie with the feeling of being unrealistic, fantasy etc... U will not enjoy it. Just sit back, and enjoy the amosphere of this awsome piece of independant filmmaking. It's original, thrilling, and its based on true facts. If u start watching the film with these three things in mind u will certainly enjoy it, others who take this movie down, are just not made for this. That's why it's an awsome or awfull movie.<br/><br/>Well, I can say this movie is for me certainly an awsome piece of ""documentary"""

","I won't go on and rehash the plot. But I will say that this movie is NOT for everyone. To see this film, you need an open mind and a pretty good imagination. If you need to see blood, gore, and things popping out at people to be scared--please see something else. The Blair Witch Project is a movie that scares without showing...it's up to you to create the horrors, the unknown, the monster that you're scared of, and take the movie in as real. Suspend your disbelief, and you won't be let down. Knowing it isn't actually based on true events, for me, didn't make it any less scary. On DVD, I think the movie loses quite a bit of the effect it had on the viewer. But even on home video, it remains effectively creepy."

If you like a good scare, rent this movie and watch it at night. The ending will blow you away! It freaked me out bigtime. Well worth 100 minutes of your time if you like psychological thrillers."
"Gjay2","10","2","3","17 May 2002"," the woods will never be the same again
","A lot of people tell me that they did not find the blair witch project scary in anyway shape or form. I later found out that most of these people had seen it in the cinema so what do they expect. You can not be truly scared when you are surrounded by loads of other people, eating and coughing and walking in and out all the time. So i waited for it to come to video. And when it arrived, i rented it, went home, waited till midnight, closed one set of curtains, left another set open, turned off all the lights and plugged in my big headphones. Now that is the best way to view this film, because after it had finished, i found myself running up the stairs, straight into the bathroom just so i could lock the door behind me. The Blair Witch Project chilled me to the bone. When i was younger, i played a lot in my local woods, and sometimes i would be afraid of what lurked in them, so this film attacked that fear with a vengeance. The performances (improvisations) were very real, aswell as the atmosphere. The attitudes the three characters had were believable, very human unlike most other horror films. And with my headphones on, each footstep, shout and the quiet cracking of twigs could be heard, which made it more chilling, as it's the almost unhearable sounds which create the scares. So if you're gonna watch this movie, do it right, be brave and watch it on your own with the lights off. I think everyone who didn't like it would have a different perspective if they watched it like that."

","One word sums up this movie: WEAK.<br/><br/>If you are anticipating a scary movie, you will be vastly disappointed. Except for the last 5 seconds, the movie was totally without anything scary. The movie spent a boring hour and a half building up for this final moment. Through this, some audience members were rewarded with motion sickness due to the actors inability to hold a camera without having violent shaking fits.  These audience members did not only go home disappointed, but they had a whopping headache as well.  Those of us who were lucky enough not to be affected by the shaking actors, got to enjoy watching 3 idiots wander around the woods because nary a one could read a compass or a map.  The only remotely entertaining part of the movie was watching the actors argue over who is to blame for their situation."

","The Blair Witch Project is without a doubt the most original and unique movie I've seen in a long time.  Besides the bone chilling fear inflicted upon me, I left the theater seriously questioning whether the movie was real or not.  In all good sense I know that it was just a movie, but since seeing it I've seen a documentary on the scifi channel all about the Blair Witch that insists that there really was three film students that disappeared while doing a documentary on the Blair Witch and whose footage was found. This film has two qualities that are outstanding in my mind, the believability of the characters and my disbelief, against my better judgement, that it was just a movie."

There is no gore or blood.  Just language, and anyone under 13 that sees it would sleep in their parents bed for 3 weeks.<br/><br/>This is the scariest movie I've ever seen.

"cougar-23","Null","2","3","2 August 1999"," Felt I should offer my first IMDb comment
","I saw TBWP on a Saturday afternoon showing, and I wasn't scared that night..or the next night really. Then, tonight (Monday night) I looked it up here and started reading the comments. After the first 20 or so, I felt the need to turn on the lights around the computer and started making sure that the doors were locked. This movie isn't the typical group-of-teenagers-find-a-slasher-and-get-killed-off-one-by-one-until-the-most-annoying-one-is-left (see any of the interminable Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street movies for that). The film itself isn't even scary in the traditional sense, but prefers to take the eerie route. Blood is replaced by  far off sounds that could be one of many things. Body parts are replaced by mysterious (in the case of the stone piles, not so mysterious) symbols.  The final 10 minutes is probably the scariest 10 minutes I've spent in a movie theater. To my mind, is is a classic psychological thriller that shows what happens to a small group of people trapped in an unknown situation with no obvious signs of escape. The naysayers I've seen on IMDb seem to have a couple of major sticking points. One, they say, is that the script is contrived.  Sorry folks, but according to most all reports I've read there WAS no script. The 3 actors were dropped into the middle of a forest with a couple of cameras and a finite supply of food. They were told to shoot their travels through the forest, and then at night the crew would attempt to scare the crap outta them . Their reactions on the screen is the real thing.  The only real plotted out point is not following the stream to civilization. The plot and dialogue show that they were following their compass in one direction with little or no deviation, yet still arrived back at the log crossing the stream. Therefore, the supernatural seems to have set in, and it wouldn't have mattered if they had followed the stream, they would have ended up at the same point anyway. To me, the only thing I might have done differently was (after the first strange occurrances) I would have slept during the day and walked during the night with EVERY SINGLE LIGHT I could find blasting. That's just me, though. All in all, the movie was a great film, and was given (during my showing, anyway) the highest accord a horror movie can be granted: when the movie ended, the theater was completely silent. Everyone was too drained to talk about the movie until they were back into the safety of the daylight."
"Andrew-151","Null","2","3","2 August 1999"," Take my advice and wait for the video release
","I know, I know, most of you feel this is the scariest movie of all time. The only scary thing about this movie was the fact that it cost $9.50 to see it.  Everyone who claims this is a masterpiece in horror needs to understand that their desperation to see a good horror movie has blinded their thought to think this was scary.  We have been deprived of scary movies for too long and we are too eager to jump on the Blair Witch to get a quick fix.<br/><br/>Hey, don't get me wrong, this movie was brilliant, but not scary.  I applaud Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for creating an original and unique movie with such a limited budget and cast.  They have proven that you don't need a billion dollars to make a good movie that makes a ton of money. If I were to compare the Haunting(newly released) and the Blair witch Project, I would have to say that the Blair Witch supersedes the Haunting in both its ability to scare and the entertainment factor.  However, they are both two movies you don't want to waste your hard earned money on.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch was astounding in originality, the acting was great and believable, and the filming was superb except for the times when I got a headache trying to focus on a jumping screen.  However, and this is a big however, they forgot to put in the scary parts.  The story was great, but they forgot to put in the scary parts.  I know they tried to add horror to this film but their attempts were feeble.  This film could of been the classic everyone is talking about if they shot a little more film and realized they were shooting a horror film not a documentary"
"Koth-3","10","2","3","2 August 1999"," Highly recommended, with one catch! (possible spoilers)
","I was completely impressed with this film.  When I first began to hear the hype, I was one of the many persons who didn't realize that the footage was fiction.  I am very glad I found out before going to see it, because the knowledge in the back of my mind that it was fiction was the only thing that kept me from freaking out completely. Simply stated:  If this film doesn't win an Oscar or two, the folks that hand them out had better just pack it up and forget the whole thing.  It has been a long time since any movie had done what this one has (neither financially or emotionally.) I have given it a 10 and would whole-heartedly recommend it for folks who are not normally plagued with nightmares after scary movies.  If you are, do yourself a favor and skip it.  You'll go broke paying for therapy."

","If you are the type of person who can easily lose sleep on a stormy night by recalling Grandma and Uncle John's sworn testimony that late great Grandpa has been known to phone during thunderstorms, you should be able to appreciate this movie.  And it definitely helps if you've spent time deep in the woods at night and don't mind barrages of profanity.<br/><br/>
A piece of advice to which all potential viewers should pay heed:  Listen to the stories told in the beginning in order to understand the ending!  Those who don't are the ones who walk out of the theater afterwards saying, ""That's it?  What happened?"" <br/><br/>I've seen The Blair Witch Project twice, in two very different audiences. The audience made the atmosphere, which I found to be the crucial element in getting into (and therefore appreciating) this movie (or not). The first group was quiet from the beginning, aside from laughter at the funny moments and yelps at the frightening ones. With silence and few distractions, people could lose their actual surroundings and be there with the campers, not to mention decipher the faint sounds that occasionally required careful listening (and good hearing).  If only the theater could have been pitch black, like the woods at night.  I would suggest closing your eyes at those times when there is audio but the screen is black, and just listening.<br/><br/>
Of course, this advice would be useless in an audience like the one in which I viewed this film the second time.  There were macho types who had to scoff loudly at every turn, a gum popper to my right, whisperers behind me, four CHILDREN jumping up and down in the front row, and various popcorn go-fers cruising the aisles the entire time.  Bad experience- there was no empathizing with the characters or catching the more subtle details, and I doubt anyone in the theater (including the five year old) was all that frightened.  The reality of the theater was too all-encompassing. <br/><br/>
You have to experience the film as a fourth (or fifth?- evil cackle) camper, who is all too aware of how sinister unusual occurrences can be when there isn't an exit sign nearby."
"Duna","Null","2","3","2 August 1999"," Unsettling mojo
","I've an older brother who, when we were younger and shared a room, would NEVER profess to being scared at horror movies.  When he'd shout in his sleep hours later, I knew better.  I wonder how many like him were in the theatre with me last Friday night.  I'm not proud -- the ending to this one had -- has -- me spooked.<br/><br/>I won't attempt to analyze why.  Too much of that spoils the fun.  It's not a perfect film.  But suffice it to say that those involved in its creation have tapped into a set of sounds and images that trigger subconscious dread and terror in a large number of people (noises in the dark, being isolated and disoriented, a feeling of abandonment, etc.).  And that's why it works, and still lingers in my head.<br/><br/>Now why can't people just play that angle?  I can understand the approach taken by Artisan in its marketing campaign, but when unaffiliated critics start bandying about phrases like ""scariest movie of the millennium,"" they're just drawing a line in the sand, and thinking too much in the short term.  Instead of people debating the interpretations of the mythology, the discussion centers mainly on how one answers the ""Was it scary for you?"" question.  And that's not enough of an intellectual challenge to keep a movie alive for too long.<br/><br/>I've wanted to see this movie since reading reports of it at Sundance.  I knew from past disappointments to simply avoid reading the thousands of subsequent news stories on its imminent arrival to my cinema.  I'm glad I did.  It won't be the last time.<br/><br/>Turn off the news.  Put down your newspaper.  Tuck away that magazine.  Veer away from that Web site.<br/><br/>Go see the movie.  Then shout in your sleep."

It was 90 degrees outside the theater when I left, yet I was covered in goose bumps and shivering from chills up and down my spine. <br/><br/>I guess if you think too much about the story you'll find things that don't make sense to you. I didn't even try. I suspended my disbelief and really let myself get absorbed by what was taking place. It felt real to me and when the film reached its climax, I was just blown away. The ending was so quick and left so many unanswered questions that my mind was reeling.<br/><br/>
Very few movies truly scare me. With most scary films I'm ultimately quite aware of the cinematic process which occurs to create a movie. With The Blair Witch Project, I really felt as though this could have actually taken place to these actual ""film makers"". Now THAT'S truly frightening."

","I've read some of the negative reviews for this film, and I can't believe they even exist. This is an incredible movie, perhaps the only movie to ever really /scare/ me. I'm a programmer by trade, and it is thus quite easy for me to dissociate myself from characters in a movie. I can look up there and see the characters of your average movie as fake. They appear to me as mere collections of pixels, slapped together on a piece of celluloid and displayed for my amusement. It was not this way with the Blair Witch Project. I saw this movie about 3 hours ago and I'm still scared senseless. I'm still shaking just a bit. I drank a couple shots of bourbon just to try to calm down. Nothing works. This movie is *that* scary. I don't know if it was faked or not, but if it was then I must say that it is a masterpiece. The characters are so afraid and their emotions are so real that even the most jaded among us can't help but empathize with them. And that, really, is the true power of this movie. It's not scary in the way that someone jumping from behind a door and saying 'BOO!' is scary. It's more the kind of scary you feel when you walk down a dark hallway and feel like someone is following you. Or the fear you feel while walking through an unfamiliar alley on a dark, cold night. It is primal fear, a fear which can't be shaken. A fear which is bred into you for your survival. That is the fear that this movie brings out in you. And that, good people, is one of the hardest fears to shake."

In my case, the hype definitely hurt--the movie was creepy, but really scary? Nah. It also became repetitive--during the day, our heroes shrieked at each other for getting lost; after dark, they heard scary things; and when it got light they shrieked some more.

"Kauffman","10","2","3","30 July 1999"," A real movie.
","It has been a couple of weeks since I saw this film on a preview.  At that time, I knew NOTHING about it except its stated premise: 3 filmmakers are lost in the woods and a year later their footage is found.  So I went, very sure that this was not the actual case.  The ending credits belied the premise.  It was ""only a movie"" after all.  Yet, throughout, I found myself involved and then I would pull myself out and say, ""would they really do that.""  I must tell you.  For pure veracity, this film is unbeatable.  It could be exactly what it says. To think such an effective film could be made for under $50,000, and have such talented actors, that the actors were the camera operators and improvise their lines, and that we see absolutely nothing that is inherently frightening, is quite amazing.  Everything that scares us is what we do not see. This is one of the best conceived film projects I have ever seen.  It uses its medium (this could be done in NO other art form) and hits where it intends.  By the way, on a more prosaic level such as was the directing/writing good? the performances sound? YES!  Every element was excellent, and Heather Donahue deserves an Oscar nomination."

"andy-227","10","2","3","27 July 1999"," The scariest film I have ever seen, or probably ever will see!
","First off, anyone who says this movie is okay, bad, or ""just plain sucked"", obviously is full of shit or needs serious psychiatric help!  This film may not be the most memorable horror film ever made, but it doesn't have to be memorable to be scary.  ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"" were memorable, yes. But were those motherf*****s scary?  I don't think so.  I am delighted that I have seen this film, yet at the same time, enraged at the negative criticism people have wrote at the IMDB!   Do you guys think you could make a better or scarier movie?  I'll believe it when I see it.  Anyway, on with my review of ""The Blair Witch Project"".<br/><br/>I honestly can't remember a time in my life where a film managed to scare me this deep into submission.  What makes this film so scary?  Well, for one thing, it's VERY realistic.  As a matter of fact, the actors truly suffered. They were deprived of food, as well as the knowledge of the fact that the directors themselves, were making the ""Blair Witch"" noises at night.  They were fooled, and the result was the capture of authentic reactions of fear on camera.  The next stroke of genius was the camerawork.  What you are seeing is supposed to be the unearthed footage of the doomed filmmakers. So, instead of paying for a cinematographer, why not give the actors the cameras.  It's their story.  They're the ones who shot the footage that was found.  Sure the camerawork is shaky.  But it's real, nonetheless.  Also, this was the first horror film I've seen that could scare you to death, without the aid of gore, special effects, music, or even a monster.  If you are deaf, or hard of hearing, then you won't be scared by ""The Blair Witch Project"" whatsoever.  You never see the ""Blair Witch"", but you can hear it. There are moments in the film, where the lenscap is on, or it's just too dark to see anything, yet you can still hear, loud and clear, what is transpiring.  I cannot describe the sounds heard by the three filmmakers. The first one is merely some twigs breaking, but the other ones are combinations of moaning and babies crying.  Whatever it was, it managed to speed up my heart rate!  Scarier still, there is little doubt in my mind that these events couldn't really happen!  I think that is the heart of the nightmare, that it could happen to you!  I've always been scared of woods, and I could've sworn on my last camping trip, that I heard something walking around outside my tent.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" brings out that phobia of darkness and the woods out of every person that sees it.  Even before I saw this film, I was scared to walk around outside my cottage at night(which is out in the country).  Does this fear worsen?  Unfortunately for the squeamish, yes!  It builds up to an unbelievable climax until something hits the camera, and complete silence fills the woods.  It's inconclusive, which is again, aiding the fright factor, because it makes you think and wonder, what did you just witness, and what happened to the three missing filmmakers?  It's a terrifying ending, and it's one I'll never forget!  I've had nightmares similar to this.  Everybody does at one point in their lives. The directors knew that.  They also knew that this kind of buildup of fear would give ""The Blair Witch Project"" it's life.  You are not going to get anything else from this film.  Not message, not euphoria, not sadness, nothing!  Just a hardcore scare, that never leaves you! NEVER!"
"schief","10","2","3","27 July 1999"," my two cents about The Blair Witch Project
","Apparently unlike a lot of the people on this site, I'm not some frustrated would-be Gene Siskel who runs out to see every new movie, then races back here to put up a lot of self-important blather disguised as a review...I'm just some schmoe who goes to go see a movie from time to time. It so happens that The Blair Witch Project is one of the best I've seen in a long, long while. A couple of points I'd like to make:<br/><br/>1. I think a lot of your enjoyment (or lack thereof) of BWP depends on the theater you're in. I was lucky and sat among several hundred other folks who were well-behaved through the entire thing, but other people I know went to a showing full of people talking/making noise/laughing at odd moments/etc., which would just absolutely kill the atmosphere for this movie. And surprise surprise, every last one of them came out not liking it that much.<br/><br/>2. I generally make it a rule to avoid horror films as much as possible, simply because I find most of them to be really, really stupid when you get right down to it. I went into this movie thinking that there was a pretty good chance it would fall into this category. How wonderful it was to be wrong. With this plot line and shooting style, it would have been really easy for BWP to turn out either hokey or too contrived, but this cast manages to avoid that perfectly. I walked in knowing full well it was fiction and STILL found myself gripping the armrest.<br/><br/>It's great to see a creative, well done low-budget independent film can still get wide distribution and exposure in today's world. But for those of you that didn't like this movie, fear not. I'm sure Hollywood will come out with another ho-hum, hype-and-tripe, overbudget 'scary' horror megamovie that's more to your tastes, like The Haunting or I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."
"g-man-22","10","2","3","25 May 1999"," The Scariest Movie in over a Decade
","Some movies stick with you, difficult to shake for days, weeks, months afterwards.  ""BW"" is one of those films.  Directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick (a swell couple'a guys, from the mere moments I had to chat with them prior to screening the film) in a pseudo-documentary style that's unlike anything you've ever seen, this is the easily the scariest film I've ever seen in a movie theater. ""Aliens"" and ""Jaws"" remain my two fave fright films (as well as Craven's original ""Nightmare""), but having not screened any of those in their original theater releases, I felt something after seeing ""BW"" akin to what audiences must've felt upon exiting the theater back in the 70's following Friedkin's ""Exorcist.""  The acting is top notch, save one argument scene by a river, and kudos in particular for Heather Donahue.  This film is most effective if you grew up in the midwest/east coast and remember those ""tell me a scary story"" campfire tales.  The film evokes an uncannily primal sense of fear through sparse visual trickery (none, really, which amounts to more style than any horror movie of the past decade, oddly enough).  Despite some spots that might be considered draggy or slow to some, this was a pleasant surprise, given the overhyped nature of other indie genre fare (""PI,"" ""Cube"") and anyone with a degree of patience will be immediately sucked in the moment the 3 characters enter the dense Maryland woods to unlock the secrets of the fabled Blair Witch.  Myrick and Sanchez are so good at scaring their audience with the most basic and rudimentary of aural/visual devices it's shocking nobody's thought of this sooner.  When the final credits rolled after the numbing final scene, the hair on the back of my neck literally stood up and I felt a twinge at the base of my spine that still hasn't worked itself out.  If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.  This film will get under your skin and stay there.  Go.  And bring someone you love, 'cause I guarantee you'll need to be grabbin' onto someone."

I realized that the final 5 minutes of the movie were really a lot more creepy than I thought while I watched.  I know it's been said, but the image in the room at the end of the film was truly chilling.  Oddly enough, I think this movie may be even better on video, in the dark and private confines of your living room, letting your imagination play without the disruption of bag candy and popcorn eating.

","Being an avid viewer of horror films I've become a bit bored with the selection of recent horror titles these days. It seemed to me that no one had any original ideas out there in movie land. Well, that's what I thought until I saw The Blair Witch Project. This isn't a movie, it's art. The characters in this film are all normal and believable, which has become a rarity in horror. The fact that this film is so real is what gives it it's greatest impact. The way the movie is shot through hand held cameras makes you feel as if you're there as all the events are unfolding. Will this movie scare you? That depends. If you're a true horror fan then you're going to get the most from this movie. The fear of the unknown is truly going to scare you. But if you're part of this whole ""Scream Generation"" of horror fans then you may not get everything this film has to offer.

When I first saw this movie, I actually thought that this whole thing was real. And I believed this for quite some time (almost a year), until I saw something at the end of the movie that said that it was all fiction and after I saw the sequel, BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2, I was positive that this was all fake. But there still are some people that believe this is real. The entire film is shot on a home video camcorder that is to document the final days of a three-person documentary film crew, going into the Black Hills Forest of Maryland to make a movie about the legendary Blair Witch. The creators of this film were very smart. They thought their plan out very well. Although many residents of the town itself were very angry with this, I find that it is great that they could create such a phenomenon with such a simple project idea. But that might be just because I myself don't actually live in Burkittsville (but that is what I said for my location anyhow). I am happy that Marilyn Manson and Korn finally did a song about the Blair Witch. Maybe it will be in the third film. The end credits even made it look like this was real. If you are a fan of movies where you never really see the evil that lurks in the ominous shadows of the movie, then this one is for you. But you are just a person who is thinking of seeing this because it sounds different, then stay away. You be just another person who will moan and groan about how bad it was and then I will just have to slap you in the face, too....5/5."

","The Blair Witch Project was a box office hit at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and was hailed by critics and audiences alike. Eventhough it only grossed $12 million in production, it was one of the biggest box office hits of 1999.<br/><br/>Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Micheal Williams are film students at Montgomary College in Maryland. They are given a project by their film professor to do a documentary about a legendary witch scandal that occured during the Colonial days. They travel to the small town of Burkitsville to interview the locals about what they know on the Blair Witch. After one day of filming, they decide to head up to Burkitsville's Black Forest where they choose to film at Coffin Rock and other locations. When they reach the forest, it starts out like a walk in the park when they stick to their path. But, as the story moves along, they go off their path which ends up getting them lost. As the nights go by, they hear noises that don't sound normal for camping, and when the sun rises, they discover new things outside their tent every morning when they wake up. Their trip turns into nothing but a pure nightmare in the Black Forest of Maryland. Their cameras never stop rolling.<br/><br/>Produced and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick (Blair Witch 2), The Blair Witch Project is a very chilling and disturbing movie that will leave you breathless by the end. For sure though, it is a very good movie.<br/><br/>Best Ages:    15 & Up!"

","When I walked in and sat down at the theater, I expected to be scared, but not THIS scared.  Like other horror flicks ths characters did stupid things (go out at night, follow a person with a voice when they obviously weren't able to make sound) but UNLIKE other horror flicks (i.e., scream & stuff) you understood their panic.  The unique way the first person view was used, helped the audience get seriously disturbed.  The audience usually couldn't SEE anything so they had to rely on their hearing sense alone.  It was such a new experience... it seemed so real that it scared me more than any other 'unreal' films could.  No special effects to be comforted with just the unknown, sudden fear inspiring panic that the characters passed on.  I loved this horror flick and warn those weak of heart shouldn't watch this."

"MASK Agent 703","10","2","3","3 December 2001"," The true fear, is within ourselves
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is not about drenching the audience with blood and gore, of terrorizing them through the film.  Well, okay, maybe the second one, but it's much more than a horror movie.  It is a crude but tolerable display of an emotion that each one of us holds dear in our hearts...fear.  Everyone fears something, no matter how big or small or important or insignificant it may be. This movie toys on that emotion to the fullest extent.  You do not watch ""The Blair Witch Project"", you feel it. We live in a world that is fully dominated by technology, and money.  With ""The Blair Witch Project"", that is not the case.  It was made on a shoestring budget, and used some of the simplest filmaking techniques around.  Yet, it shows us that no matter what we may see when it comes to horror, the greatest creator of fear is our own imaginations.  And in a day and age where technology is king, queen, prince, and the rest of the dynasty, ""The Blair Witch Project"" proves that the stuff out there that really scares the pants off of us is what we don't see."
"drewinlove","10","2","3","12 October 2001"," I know it's a fake, but still scary.
","Before I saw ""the Blair witch project"", all of the mass media said that it was a fiction, more real than a non-fiction. I took it as a commercial thing, only to raise concern. They also recommended to go ad check the ""Blairwitch.com"", an official web site of the movie.( Later,I was aware of the fact that without the basic information of the movie, it isn't scary at all.) I took their recommend and saw the movie finally. At first, the trembling of the scenes and unfamiliar actors seemed to me that it was pretending to be a sort of documentaries. But as running of the movie, I found myself trembling with fear just like the actors doing at the scenes. Even the subject of the fear,like Freddy Kruger, appears enough. It just gives you the feelings that you are chased with something, and you can sleep peacefully no more. It's the beauty of the film. It's not that kind of bloody horror movie. Without lots of blood, screaming, and chopped body, the Blair witch project team made it a really scary movie. Except The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist, no horror movie made it ""horror"" only with unidentified thing and people's fear and insanity ever. I know it's a fake, but still scary. Literally SCARY."

Proof that a low budget movie can be just as good as one with a lavish budget. The creators and directors must be geniuses. I'd like to see the footage they scrapped, too.

"ScaryBoy","10","2","3","1 August 1999"," The best horror movie ever made
","The above statement is no lie. The Blair Witch Project was absolutely magnificent from start to finish. It replaces Scream as my favorite horror movie, even though they are too totally different to compare to one another. The performances in Blair Witch are totally convincing and amazing. I have always heard the phrase ""Just keep telling yourself it's only a movie . .."", but I never really knew what that felt like -- until now. Seeing the looks on the actors' faces, it felt like you were there with them and you could totally identify with them. The three actors were excellent, with emotions ranging from humor to sorrow to sadness to fear to utmost horror. Heather Donahue especially does well with her character undergoing the most significant change, but Mike Williams and Josh Leonard are good too. The scares are more subtle in this film than in your usual thriller - there is no clanging musical score to let you know when the scares are coming. The uneasiness starts off slow, with the film throwing us off-balance early on with a great deal of humor. But gradually the terror becomes more and more apparent, and you feel more and more like grabbing hold of the nearest person and not letting go until it's all over. And what an ending - several people have said it's not clear enough what happens, but I disagree. I think it is good just the way it is. By the finale you are totally run ragged, and it ends perfectly. I think everyone should see this movie. Forget about the cliches of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; the real deal in horror movies is this amazing film. 11/10"

","Boy... I don't know if I've ever seen so many mixed feelings towards a movie. Some people were so offended that they felt the need to post multiple comments here! If you have that many issues that you have to keep coming back and re-insulting this movie, then maybe it touched a nerve and you just don't want to admit it.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is an experiment in fear. It gives the impression that three student filmmakers are going into the Maryland woods to film a documentary about a supposed witch that lived in the area many years ago. It is also insinuated that the witch influenced a serial killed in the '30s. Unfortunately for our clueless heroes, they get REALLY lost in the woods and spend a couple of days just wandering around. They have a compass, so it seems that the Witch is somehow causing them to walk in circles. As the intrepid trio travel through the woods, they find little ""gifts"" left behind by the Witch... piles of stones, little men made of sticks, and a rather nasty bundle with a soft, chewy center. A particularly scary part features an attack on the group's tent. Later, one of them vanishes in the night. The remaining two students finally end up at the house of the 30's serial killer...<br/><br/>No spoilers. You'll have to see what happens for yourself.<br/><br/>I'm not pretending that this is a major Hollywood release... less than $50,000 was spent on equipment and production. But this isn't meant to be high-budget. The movie looks exactly like it's supposed to... a student film that was edited together by people who found the ""lost"" footage after the students ""disappeared"". (I did think it was funny that some people thought this was real... the hype on the Sci Fi channel was great - it took quite a bit of convincing, plus video footage of the three actors alive and well on MTV, to show that they were still alive!)<br/><br/>I think some people are angry at this film because they were expecting the next Exorcist or Poltergeist. Unless you're blind, it's blatantly obvious from the previews that the movie is shot with shaky cameras in a very ""real"" environment. If you came to this movie expecting something else, then you deserve to lose your $7.50.<br/><br/>Also, I think people were really p***ed that they didn't get to see the Witch. In this age of CGI monstrosities and special effect-packed blockbusters, many movie-goers expect to see the monster all the time. If that's what you want, go rent The Haunting remake or Godzilla. I'd wager these same people would get upset at the original Haunting for not showing the ghosts. <br/><br/>Maybe some of the people who hate this movie really WERE scared and it bothered them so much that they decided to pan the flick. Either way, I think it's worth giving this movie a chance... don't take it too seriously, though... it's a much better ride if you sit back and try to watch it with an open mind. Be prepared, because the ""action"" doesn't really kick in until halfway into the movie, and there isn't a whole lot of it. This is more of a suspense movie, not a slasher flick or an action horror movie.<br/><br/>I've seen BWP twice in the theatre and once on video... and the last 5 minutes STILL gives me goosebumps."
"Robert Thompson","10","2","3","26 May 2001"," Truly frightening
","I can see why so many people didn't like this movie and it was very interesting to hear other peoples comments as I left the Theatre. It seemed to me that it was mainly the younger audience did not get the movie or the concept behind it.<br/><br/>I was truly frightened by this movie and I think this has a lot to do with my age. I was raised on a diet of old black and white Dracula movies and me and my sister used to sit up every Friday night, pillows ready to hide our faces, being scared stupid by these movies. Looking back at these movies now they are not vary scary but they are not graphic either. You only ever got to see some vague shadows and very little else. Every thing else was in you imagination.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project has tapped into this fear very effectively. By not showing what is stalking our hapless adventures the directors are letting our imaginations run riot as to who or what is following them.<br/><br/>I think younger viewers of this movie has been brought up watching films where every thing was shown and nothing was left up to the imagination. They wanted to be shown everything and were disappointed when they weren't.<br/><br/>This movie is unique and could not be made in the same style again until this movie is a distant memory.<br/><br/>If you like  to let you imagination take over from the movie makers this movie is for you.

"waxwingslain77","10","2","3","5 April 2001"," One of the best horror movies ever; here's why:
","SPOILER ALERT. Don't read this unless you have seen the film.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch,"" very original but shot on a very low budget, with no star names, no standard glitter or spectacle is still an excellent film. In fact that is WHY it is excellent; it is original, it is completely non-Hollywood, the dialogue is so good that I felt drawn into the film as I watched it, something which rarely happens with me. In other words, because the three were saying EXACTLY the sort of things I would say in a similar situation, I ""felt"" this film potently.<br/><br/>I love the constantly moving camera, said camera being the chief complaint from those who ""hated"" the film, I think the acting is flawless and the direction and photography make this movie REAL. And what a pleasure to see a horror movie without the cliche-ridden often stupid shock music most horror films have!<br/><br/>I personally relate most to Mike. He is skeptical from the start, and I get the feeling he agreed with Heather and Josh out of boredom more than anything else. ""Thank you for the opportunity,"" Mike says to Heather and I hear a faint blend of reluctance and sarcasm almost at the film's start. Mike is the first to say ""we're lost,"" something I believe Heather and Josh also know, but don't want to admit.<br/><br/>I would not have kicked the map into the creek, (even though the map really was worthless if you think about it,) but otherwise I would have been a near clone of the Mike character. Mike doesn't like the camera on him, and makes no bones about it. ""Shoot some ambiance!"" he says to Heather after she has yet again stuck her camera in his face. My reply would have been more curt than was Mike's. Mike is the most down-to-earth character in the film and I don't think it coincidence that Josh, not Mike or Heather, disappears first.<br/><br/>But I like the other two as well. Heather is an archetypal film student know-it-all, right down to her arrogance. She is completely self-absorbed, (""I'd like to mark this occasion,"") she says acidly when Josh and Mike are complaining about moving on, and she lives to regret her stance. Josh later turns the camera on Heather, who, VERY SIGNIFICANTLY, says ""Are you expecting me to say something?"" She whines to Josh, even though she has practically rammed the camera into both Josh's and Mike's souls. When Josh really starts yelling at Heather, the bitter sarcasm he uses is most understandable. (I personally love it!)<br/><br/>Josh is the first to entirely break down. This is completely unexpected, I was sure it would have been Mike. Josh puts on a convincing laid back facade but when things get bad, he's the first to crack. This was a brilliant stroke.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" is a character study, if you'll pardon the expression. I was only scared once. (Those straw and twine symbols of hell in the trees, you know the scene.) Otherwise I was fascinated, and I have seen this rather short film several times. The dialogue, the characters, the moving camera; We KNOW something is going to happen. Indeed something does happen, in fact several things happen, one of them being an extremely well crafted film which contains MUCH more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>I give ""Blair Witch"" a ten."

Best of all, the feelings of horror and suspense are not produced through the usual set of Hollywood techniques -- expensive SFX, overimposing sound track, and the usual plot line of ""girl / couple get killed after / while having sex"".<br/><br/>One word of warning though:  you MUST see this film on the big screen, it just will not work if you see it on video.

I read many comments who claimed that this just was not scary, but it was. There have been scarier movies, definitely ( The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, It ), but this is at least in the Top 10 of the scariest movies ever. You just have to want it to be scary. I am glad that I love this movie, since so many people did not. <br/><br/>Good points : acting, directing, authentic camera work, story, ENDING<br/><br/>Bad points : sequel, too short, there could have been more shock effects ( there were just some, but those were very shocking )<br/><br/>All in all, I rate this movie 9.8/10 and recommend watching it alone in a dark room.<br/><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.<br/><br/>CU; Rinho."

"kirk.wagstaff","Null","2","3","1 January 2001"," Brilliant
","I saw this film a year after it came out, I have lost the love for modern horror movies, since the actual emphasis nowadays is on gruesome deaths and limbs flying all over the place. I've heard all the hype, and came to the assumption that this was another hyped up cash-in. When I saw this going as an ex-rental in the local video store, I decided to give it a go.<br/><br/>That teaches you never to take advice from Internet Know-It-All's. With all the bad reviews, and hype, I ignored all the bad press and sat down to watch it as if it were a new, unknown film. Well well well, what a surprise. I really enjoyed it. Instead of OTT acting, this is what we would really see if we were in this position. Life-like acting. Very realistic. We see it from their point of view, from the camera. For once, I didn't see people getting slashed to bits, or have to watch a poor sex scene added for ratings. However, one criticism could be given, the amount of bad language. ""F this"", ""F that"", ""F you you F-ing F-er. I'll F-ing F you up you F-ing F."" However, this is exactly what X-Gen students are like, so it only adds to the realism.<br/><br/>The last film I saw which scared me was John Carpenters Prince Of Darkness, it scared me more then The Exorcist ever did (speaking of which, was a over-hyped piece of garbage). The Blair Witch Project brings back those childhood memories of haunting myths, and legends, to life thanks to three students with cameras, investigating into the uncovered legend of the Blair Witch. What they uncover is extraordinary - but believable. The amateur camerawork brings their tale to life. That is the fact which makes this so chilling. No super-imposed rubbish like in other supernatural movies. No monsters or unconvincing special effects. The horror is in the unseen, the unspeakable. In the last 45 minutes, what you witness will send your imagination wild. What exactly went on in the night? What is in the dark? Who is the Blair Witch?<br/><br/>Thanks to all the hype, which has shed light on the film, viewers are prevented from enjoying the full experience. The less you know, the better. Thankfully, the Internet Know-It-All's didn't spoil the fun for me. To those who criticise the film for being low-budget, please answer me one question: What exactly is your criteria for a film? It seems like any film boasting huge special effects and explosions is an instant hit - BWP goes beyond this by providing the viewer with a chill-fest, a film which stretches the imagination and proves that the real horror is all in the mind. Films like Scream are putting the horror film genre into a rut - it's such a breath of fresh air to see a film like this which doesn't rely on big stars who take the actual emphasis of the horror film away.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is the best horror film I've seen, in five years. That might not seem like a long time, but in those years, I've seen hundreds of horror flicks. Nothing in that time scale comes close to what the Blair Witch Project stands for. Originality isn't a common thing these days, and with the film industry focusing on rolling in the money with big special effects and death-fests, there won't be many films like this. 5/5."
"Jat-7","10","2","3","23 December 2000"," Don't let the subtlety throw you
","As a straight horror movie, if that were all there was, I didn't find it terrifying. Supremely tense, definitely, particularly in the scenes without light; and when reflecting on it afterwards the full impact of its chilling nature hit me more. It doesn't provide the shockfest that horror audiences want the most, though. However, I found it excellent as a psychological thriller. We get to watch as three ordinary people, complete with ordinary flaws that make them all the more believable, are exposed to extreme stress with inevitable consequences. Watching them break down, culminating in an incredible monologue by Heather, is a fascinating experience. The realism is also top notch; while others might decry the lack of any kind of polish, I reckon it's just that that makes it so intriguing. It could easily be real life that's being filmed, a premise aided by the very natural acting of the three main characters. Eerie, unsettling and very effective in its subtlety, this ranks as one of my favourite films and well worth watching."

","I remember being afraid to enter the cellar at all hours.I was afraid to enter a dark room and I was afraid to enter anyplace that represented darkness.I was afraid because I did not know what was beyond that darkness.So what a chilling experience it was for me when I viewed ""The Blair Witch Project"".In actuality,""The Evil Dead"" which was also set in the woods,did a much better job at scaring me as well as this film did.They are both great horror films that deal with the unknown. What remained so eerie about this film is that we are never allowed to remind ourselves that this is only a movie.It works because there are no special effects,big stars or a man running around with a machete wearing a hockey mask.""The Blair Witch Project"" is the kind of horror movie that I would probably watch once every Halloween.Do I think ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the scariest films ever made.Yes,I do.I don't think it's scary enough to freak us out.""The Exorcist"" did a better job at that.""The Blair Witch Project"" is worth being called one of the scariest films ever made because in my opinion,the unknown can be a frightening subject and that is what ""The Blair Witch Project"" is all about."
"Speechless","10","2","3","15 December 2000"," War of the movie fans...
","I love and admire every single frame of The Blair Witch Project, and nothing anyone says will ever be able to shake me from that opinion.  BWP is, for me at least, one of the scariest movies of all time.  <br/><br/>You have to pay attention, you have to think, you have to imagine.  The movie doesn't show us the witch for the same reason 2001 doesn't show us aliens and the original Jaws barely ever shows us the shark--your imagination is much more effective at creating those images than any special effects artist could ever be.  We live in an age where every movie plot point is so thoroughly explained that even the dullest audience member can follow the action and where special effects take the place of characterization.  It's incredibly refreshing when a rare movie like this one that actually respects its audience comes along.<br/><br/>Maybe the problem is that the film respects its audience too much.  I guess people see the words ""scary as hell"" in the trailer and they go to the movie expecting to see blunt, frightening images.  But that's not the way BWP works, and those viewers just sit there waiting for some more traditional movie scare that never comes.  Or maybe they've never been out in the woods, and have no idea how incredibly creepy it can be out there at night.  Maybe they were too busy ruining the movie for everyone else, yawning and making jokes and obnoxiously asking if the movie was over yet, to be able to hear any of the dialogue.  Or maybe they just enjoy bashing successful, publicized movies because they want to feel different from everyone else.  I don't know.<br/><br/>Too many people have the mistaken impression that a movie takes one form and that's it, that's all the movie is.  The Blair Witch Project is different. It's like a horror movie Mad Lib.  It can be as scary as you want it to be."

UNREAL!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","3","3 September 2000"," Whether you love it or you hate it, you have to respect The Blair Witch Project for its uniqueness and its originality.
","One of the many unique things about the Blair Witch Project is that no one liked it. Everyone who saw it either absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it, there was unusually little in between. It should be noted that no one has ever made a professional film like this before. People often joke about a movie being so bad that a student filmmaker could make a better one. Well, a student filmmaker really COULD make a movie like the Blair Witch Project, but the point is that no one has ever made a film this deliberately crude and yet attained such stunning success. <br/><br/>The makers of the Blair Witch Project cleverly avoid the inevitable comparisons to student films by making the actual premise of the film as a student documentary. That's what makes the movie so good! The tagline is about a bunch of kids who went into the woods, got lost, and whose video footage was found a year later. That makes the film itself realistic beyond all other horror films. The methods of production enabled the actors to present an even more convincing portrayal of a bunch of kids lost in the woods and desperate to get out. A lot of times they didn't even know what was going on with the picture, they really WERE lost and confused. Another notable element of this movie is the way that they were able to create such a tense atmosphere with a virtual absence of gore. This is proof that you do not need buckets of blood in order to make a good scary movie.<br/><br/>
So many people complained about the shaky camera work in the Blair Witch Project. They say that it was terrible filmmaking because the camera is always bouncing around, but that was done on purpose! Don't these people realize that the home video look was the primary goal for the finished product here? These kids didn't go out into the woods to shoot this documentary with a full-on film crew complete with caterers and everything else, they went ALONE. However, there was a little bit of botched editing in this film. It is meant to be presented as though they found their video cameras, and what you see on the screen is simply what they recorded on their cameras, with little, if any, editing. Obviously the two cameras they used needed to be edited together so that they show the same material, but there was at least one scene where Heather was seen on the opposite side of a stream crossing the log (the one that they had come back to), but her voice is heard as though it is her holding the camera.<br/><br/>
Overall, the Blair Witch Project is a very original and satisfying horror movie, but you have to have an open mind. You have to be able to accept something that was made different than your traditional movie is made, and try to really understand what is different about it and what makes it good. I think that one of the best things about the story is that it leaves so much to the imagination. You never see what is actually tormenting them from out in the woods, all you see is the dark, and that makes every individual audience member imagine whatever it is that they fear the most out there in those woods. In this sense, the film is almost interactive. No other horror film has ever come close to doing anything like that, and the Blair Witch Project should be recognized for it. This is an original, entertaining, and ultimately terrifying film, and you see something new every time you see it."

I'm one of those that loved it.<br/><br/>First, the movie has this ""feeling"" of reality, that convincing look, that strange resemblance with the everyday people and live. I found that kind of ""ambience"" in only one more feature: The Simpsons TV series, although for completely different reasons.<br/><br/>In the Simpsons, i think that the sounds and the voice acting were extremely reality-inducing.<br/><br/>In TBWP, every part of it (picture, sound, acting, improvising) transpires a strange sense of real life happenings, that no special effects can buy...<br/><br/>The movie is quite slow for some time, i must admit. But thats part of its ""magic"": the viewer must be given the change to ""relate"" with the characters, to know then, to care for them.<br/><br/>I think that it didn't work for some people, but then again, some people loved Holywood's Godzila, which show us that we are all different from each other... :)<br/><br/>Anyway, the last 20 or 15 minutes are the most dense and mind blowing piece of movie that i've seen for quite some time... i actualy got scare a couple of times, even though we don't see much ""explicities"" on the screen. Its our own mind that scare us.<br/><br/>Just to finish this lenghty review, i would like to say that the ending is just p-e-r-f-e-c-t, a wonderfull climax to those last 20 minutes of adrenaline and worries.<br/><br/>My advice? See it like if it was something that popped up on the evening news, let yourself be ""absorbed"" by its reality, and forget all those teen-slashing flicks"
"RElKO","10","2","3","25 July 2000"," Pure terror, for only 50.000 dollars in production costs.
","First of all, to all the people saying nothing much happened in ""Blair Witch project"", this is NOT ""Friday the 13th part 10"". So if you wanted to see this movie thinking a hockeymask-wearing maniac jumps from the bushes, lopping heads off with an axe, you've been heavily misinformed. You can't be cheated, nothing of the sort was ever stated in the ads. This is a movie about REAL terror, not about 7 foot mutes who get up after stabbing them 20 times with a pitch fork. Those who say they've never been remotely scared or at least feeling uneasy when hearing strange sounds in the woods at night, read no further. You don't really exist. I dare you to really watch this movie, try to experience it, and then go out in the woods at night and say you're totally cool when you hear children crying out in the dark, or twigs snapping all around you as if you're surrounded by a group of unknown animals or even humans.<br/><br/>I must honestly say i knew about the hype when i saw this movie, and still wasn't disappointed, because once again, i KNEW there was going to be no Jason hiding in any barn waiting for an unsuspecting victim to foolishly come strolling in just to get spliced into ribbons of human flesh. I expected frustration, anger, fear, hysteria and downright TERROR. You know, the emotions real people have when in a situation like this. That's why the acting was perfect. These were real flesh and blood people who first got uneasy, then frustrated to getting more scared with each abnormal sound or found object. Real people yell at each other when frustrated and get hysterical when at the end of their emotional ropes. The photography and editing was perfect too. To people saying it was amateuristic: HELLO,WAKE UP! The whole idea of the movie is based on the premise of amateur filmmakers making the footage we, as an audience, see when they go into the woods. If these amateur filmmakers made professionally shot footage, then it would have been an amateuristic movie. The whole thing is brilliant. Right upto and including the nerve-wrecking ending. If you only have about 50.000 dollars to spend and want to make to make the best movie you can make with that kind of movie, this is how you make it.<br/><br/>Remember: Godzilla cost over 100 million dollars. What a great movie that turned out to be, huh?"
"stonkey","10","2","3","20 July 1999"," This is no ordinary scary movie
","I'm of a generation that knows the horror genre primarily as a gore-ridden slasher fest. I'm talking about a type of movie that sought to scare through cheap shock tactics that never work the second time around (IMHO). This movie does not employ shock value. It keeps you guessing, keeps you wondering, keeps you worrying. This is not a fun scare. This movie follows you home and whispers things in your ear, conjures images from the movie in your mind, when you're trying to get to sleep. It takes our primal fears of the dark and unknown and makes them a raw, visceral reality. An experience of eight horrifying days is distilled into one eight-seven minute descent into walking nightmare. Do not watch it alone. Do not watch it at night. It is the most effective, consistently horrifying piece of cinema I have ever seen. I could not have imagined that a movie could scare me so much. Anyone who has not seen it should take heed: it will hurt your mind. It is not gross. It is hardly bloody. It is hardly violent. The R rating is primarily because of extensive profanity. But it should be rated R regardless of the profanity. Don't take your kids to see it unless they've done something bad."

","The Blair Witch Project is a film that was slaughtered by hype and propaganda. When the previews came out it, the film was described as being the scariest movie ever made and it was compared to films such as The Exorcist. As a result, people went to see the movie expecting to be frightened out of their mind. In a lot of cases, the film had trouble living up to these expectations. I feel this film has been treated incredibly unfairly by the public because it is a very scary movie. You find a lot of people didn't like it because you never actually see the witch. Other people say there wasn't enough violence. I think this movie is very tastefully made and uses the art of subtlety to scare its audience. The scariest thing about the film is its intense realism and credibility. It seems so realistic. You can imagine it happening to you. If you haven't seen this movie, then go and see it for yourself.

","I have never been so drained, physically and mentally, than when walking out of the cinema after seeing this, surely a modern classic, and quite possibly an Exorcist' for the MTV generation. We all know now of the legend of the Blair Witch and how three young and arrogant students got lost in the woods, their only legacy being their footage. It is this knowledge of the film that has perhaps partially ruined the experience of this film for me and many others. I can only imagine how terrified I might of been had I believed that what I was seeing was real, as those who saw it at Sundance did. Yet the film holds together brilliantly despite, or maybe even because of, the hype that has surrounded it's entrance to the UK.<br/><br/>	What the film does best is to build up the tension, almost silently, and allow one thing to go wrong after the other before dropping the crew (and us) in a living hell, within reach of all of us. It is hard to define the point at which they realise that they really are going to die, because it all builds up on different layers. The genius is that we are seeing this arrogant bunch do everything wrong, yet we know that we would do exactly the same thing in their position. We are annoyed with them, but we don't want them to die, even though we know they will. <br/><br/>	Because we never see exactly what it is which is stalking them, we are left to imagine something far worse than CGI or animatronics could conjure up. The sound effects paint everything for us. The gore is minimal, but devastating. The design of the film (the stick figures, the house, the hand prints) is extremely effective. But what the film gives us more than anything is indescribable fear which oozes out of the film at every moment. The pace never lets up, and we are left every bit as exposed to the terror on the screen as the characters are, thanks to the ultra realism provided by the vérité style of the film. Thank God Hollywood didn't pick up on this, for it would have no doubt tainted the film with effects, music, gore and A-List actors. There is nothing intellectual or clever' about the film, but that is not the point, because this reduces the audience to a primal state, turning us into the closest we have ever become to cavemen.<br/><br/>	I don't think that it was a fluke that this film was a success, and I fail to see how anyone could be less than terrified by it. I have noticed that those friends of mine not scared by it are not the most imaginative people I know, and if there is one thing that could have been added to this film, I think it would be a glimpse of the witch, and JUST a glimpse, for anything more than that would render the film dead. I believe it would have worked every bit as well as the gore did, for as I walked out of the foyer, the dialogue that was ringing around my head to that final, truly disturbing image was not Heather's now infamous monologue in the tent but rather the early description of the witch by a local. The key to this films success is really the fact that you are not once spoon-fed a CGI ghoul or witch, but are treated like an intellectual, educated filmgoer, who can imagine the witch perfectly well (although it would still have been nice to see it)."

She would be being congratulated for acting when all she was doing was portraying herself as she had no idea what was going on anyway.

Hitchcock knew how to bring suspense in a picture (like ""the Birds"" or ""Psycho""), a number of movies knew how to bring scary filth (like ""Evil dead"" or ""Hellraiser""), both being able to scare you in some way. This movie doesn't either of them. Together with the illogical behaviour of the 3 main characters to find a way out of the woods, I had to close my eyes many times: It was a slow, boring, illogical and bad movie.

All they did was go into the forest, get lost, kick the map into a river, lose one of their mates, get very scared, end. The ending was totally c**p and it was way to sudden. They go in the house, run up and down some stairs, and bingo they fall over and the movie ends. When I saw the credits come up I exclaimed a mixture of WTF and you have to be f**king kidding!

Put that in front of a Parkinson's Patient using a handheld video camera and you have the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/> I'll keep this real short, because most of the negatives have already been discussed. But explain this; these three kids get lost in the woods, and even after they're terrified and at the point when survival is the number one priority, why did they continue to film the whole thing? (Even when they indulged into a few physical fights? Wouldn't they at least set the camera down?) This is amateur filmmaking at best, so shoestring and holed that it probably didn't even take a full day to square it out. You don't need a huge budget to make a good film, but if you extend your time, efforts will prove to be more thought out and worthwhile. That wasn't the case here. The premise was extremely mundane (Anyone who hasn't seen The Vanishing, Cannibal Holocaust or 84 Charlie Mopic, first, would understand), the delivery was ill-concieved and overbaked, and the characters were no less annoying than those in the common Hollywood teen horror flick.<br/><br/> This is a rape of intelligence, money, and time. If, to you, life is a terrible thing to waste, you'll be better off avoiding this movie. I say this as a friendly suggestion."

","When getting ready to go and see the Blair Witch Project I had seen a fair amount of television programmes showing scenes of the film with pictures of film-goers coming out of the cinema scared witless. The thing is that they must have been witless in the first place because all this film is, is a cheap camcorder documentary. The actors strive to be real which somehow they never achieve. Only the last 15 minutes of the film were remotely scary while the 65 mins at the start were weak. To believe the legend you would have to be Mr. Gullible which doesn't help. I thought that in the last 15 minutes the film could redeam itself with... (do not read on if you haven't seen the film)..<br/><br/>...some mutilations and the girl (who screamed so much I wanted to kill her)running around being chased. Unfortunately this film would have been good if it was as good as the hype, but it never could match that, maybe that was the problem. I read somewhere that the film cost $33,000 dollars to make so I shouldn't be too harsh but as it approches or maybe goes over $100 million in the box office I can but wonder ""is this a huge scam?"" Th mystery of the Blair Witch to me is how it ever became so great in the eyes of the critics.  when I register my vote on IMDB I will do so accordinally."

","We had a website devoted to it, trailers, magazine articles, and superfluous information about it, so when this film finally arrived on these shores it was not going to have the same effect as when it opened in America. Shot with video cameras on a minuscule budget, the film is about an asinine trio of film students who decide to go into the woods and make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. Led by the bossy and foul-mouthed Heather (who seems to use the 'F' word in every sentence) along with her two geeky-type male associates, they get lost and are stalked by an unseen witch/spirit/whatever it is, notice the word unseen, we never see anything only sets of twigs made into a strange symbol and the tent moving, and we hear lots of strange noises at night. At first the amateurish camera style works but soon becomes tiresome as the trio constantly bicker. The ending is also unsatisfactory. The film has broke box office records and good luck to it, but when you have seen it you feel letdown. There was howls of derision at the cinema when I saw it, and that was from a lot of people. An overrated disappointment. Don't believe the hype."

It has all the scary essentials: Dark forest, scary noises, stories of witches but it fails to create any atmosphere at all. Given a big enough budget this film could have been terrifying. Instead it was just dull. Most of the time you are staring at a black screen waiting for something to happen.

","This movie should be retitled in the name of Psychology. I suggest a name change from 'The Blair Witch Project' to 'The Effects of What a pseudo-Documentary of Three Bickering, Swearing, Sleep, Food and Cigarette Deprived American 20-Somethings With Over-Active Imaginations Due to Emotional Instability the lack of the afore mentioned] Can Have have not!] on a typical American audience.' Doubtlessly that title would be a burden for cinema-listings, but seriously! This movie seemed over-long, yet it couldn't have been more than a little over an hour long. I couldn't help yawning. Maybe I'm not impressionable enough, maybe I've seen too many cheap-thrill type shockers to get the subtlies... maybe the home-films shot by my parents of my siblings and I frolicking in our garden are more inspired. Lets face it, this 'film' just defies any logical explanation of a plot, a purpose or a reason. Furthermore, it has been way overhyped. The short trailer featuring a snippet of the Heather character's desperate soliloquy to the camera was actually scarier out of context on the t.v. screen. But that's the price you pay for creating false impressions--some are driven home in individuals willing and possessing the trait of being conned by hype; others just end up having their illusions shattered. Just between you and me, I knew deep down I wouldn't be scared, cause that's just not my personality, but I needed to verify it. Perhaps that's the other attraction of such movies... they make us doubt our senses and our convictions. But only temporarily. The moral of this story is that the real scares we have to experience ourselves. I don't believe such badly filmed footage can recreate in the audience any feelings of the terror felt by the actors."

It's truly depressing and disturbing, but why would anybody want to go to the cinema for those emotions, for a good fright, yes. But depression and disturbance is something we want NOTHING of in our lives.<br/><br/>d/ The language and dialogue - This is REALLY were the film screwed up, I have no problem with the ""F"" word when used infrequent and for the right reasons, but the use in this film was appaling. At no point was the rest of the dialogue clever.<br/><br/>e/ The filming - Good for about all of 5 minutes and then it just got clearly boring and messy.<br/><br/>f/ The plot - Um... didn't have much of one really. The ideal of going into the woods for a project was ""different"" but the rest a What was the nonsense about a witch anyway, more likely it was just Josh fooling around with the kids, maybe they didn't even get killed.

Where were the scary parts?

"upstartfilmworks","10","2","3","17 July 1999"," A truly scary, watershed moment in filmmaking
","There are going to be two kinds of people that walk out of this film.  Some will be immediately shaken by it.  It will take the rest until they get home,  shut off the lights and try to go to sleep until they realize just how much the film messes with you.  Most of the latter are going to be of the backlash mentality, as this film's hype was only second to that of the Phantom Menace.  Fortunately it lives up to the hype.  This film delivers horror on that base, gut level that The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and (to some extent) the Evil Dead gave us.  This is not a cut-and-dried post modern horror flick like the sort that typifies the genre of late. The main premise if you haven't heard it:  Three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams) disappear into the woods while shooting footage for a documentary on a regional legend, The Blair Witch.  A year after that, their footage is found, and the conceit is that what we are watching is the actual footage of what happened, edited by Haxan Films.  What happens?  There are no easy answers, and in all actuality, it will take you a while to form the questions as well.  It bears the mark of a well-made horror film (or any film for that matter): it makes you think, and stays with you after leaving the theater.  All three of the students give frighteningly real performances that are wrenching at times, especially Heather's confessional towards the end of the film in which her eyes are those of a hunted, frightened animal.  The movie succeeds on a technical level as well, being largely an improv piece between the three main actors (who incidentally, also completely shot the film, contrary to recent reports that this was untrue) who were given basic character directions and rations by the directors, Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick.  The directors also basically told them, `We will mess with you at night.  You will never be in danger, but you will get messed with.  Film everything.'  What resulted was 18 hours of footage culled from an 8 day trek in the woods that eventually go cut down to a highly effective 82 minute film in which the fear and hunger are, to some extent,  very real.  Take note, this cinema verite approach is not completely new.  Benoit Pooelverde used it to great success in Man Bites Dog, (which also features a similar denouement), and the sparsely released The Last Broadcast also features the same plot device (among other interesting similarities: a crew from a faux documentary access show gets slaughtered in the woods, and their footage is all that is left). Even if the Haxan films guys bit a little off of these preceding films, and I'm not saying that they did, they still managed to turn out a hell of a good film that I can easily label (as a horror buff since infancy) as the scariest this decade.  It has had some detractors, people complaining about the shaky camera work (part of the idea, when you're being chased by a supernatural force in the woods you don't have time to frame up shots), or about the fact that there's no latex-covered face for the horror in the woods, no boogeyman that gives us a payoff, very little gore...but therein lies the charm and freshness.  I challenge any of the naysayers to try to go out and spend a night in the wilderness now.  Then would they realize how deep this film cuts.  It is an innovative and welcome change from Scream-era mindless horror.  The only bad thing is that it will probably spawn a slew of copycats.  But hopefully said copycats will realize that you can make a very good film on a very little budget as long as you have a good script or extremely well-fleshed out idea and an excellent cast."

Yes, it's different, yes it has suspense. Generally though there is no substance and no decent 'events' within the film. The premise alone may negate the requirement for graphic or typical plot devixes, but you have to question the validity of a film that seeks to exist on a fictional authentic-esque documentary film style but neither shocks, revolts or disturbs to any degree whatsoever. It was though a change not to have familiar predictable shock scenes, over the top mutilation or typical actors, film grade and of course artificial/background soundtrack. As a concept it could run. However, with no plot, it plods. And although the ending was necessarily weird, it just reminded me of the ending of Monty Python's Holy Grail. Vaguely interesting, ultimately very disappointing."

","So, it's been hyped to death as most films seem to be these days, but is it really any good? In my opinion, no. The film makes clever use of the home movie style footage, but the whole thing is a complete waste of time. Hardly anything actually happens in the film apart from a lot of noise and blurred pictures. This could be argued to contribute to the chill factor of the film, but in my opinion it really just annoys by not ever actually showing what is going on. You probably think I'm just not getting it, but I would say that I get what it is supposed to be, but it really isn't that.

The characters were poorly developed and not the least appealing.  I didn't care what happened to them.

Both movies caused alot of people to think that they are real and not just a movie which I liked about them because they do look really and do make you wonder.  <br/><br/>They movie makers are very smart in that they integrated the Internet with the movie (blairwitch.com).  If you saw just the movie you may wonder about the legend of the Blair Witch or what happened after or before and the Internet site tells you just that and also makes the movie seem all the more real.  After I went to the Internet site(yes I went there after the movie) the movie seemed alot scarier.

After seeing this movie, I envied those dead people buried in the nearby cemeteries. They did not have to sit through 87 minutes of shaky handheld footage. <br/><br/>Rather than a ghost story, the Blair Witch Project is largely a pseudo-documentary about three often-obnoxious Gen-Xers lost in the woods. We grasp their plight early in the film, so it's difficult to endure their bickering and histrionics after that point is made. By the time we arrive at the film's climax, most of us are glad to know that these tiresome filmmakers will be bound, tortured and disemboweled.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project Web site actually contains more information than we see presented in the film. Web surfers are allowed to read the ""back-story"" of the Blair witch and her lingering hold on the Burkitsville community. I was hoping to see some standard ""talking head"" footage of the law enforcement officers and the private investigator who eventually located the personal effects of the missing filmmakers. I also expected interviews with the trio's grieving friends and relatives.

","Title pretty much says it all. It was marketed as being ""real"" and shills were HEAVILY involved with reviewing this film. Now this is the the worst Horror film and possibly one of the worst films ever made for 2 reasons. First, it's not a horror film. It's people walking in the woods who made a home video. Secondly, it spawned the worst trend ever in horror being the ""found footage"" subgenre. Now I admit found footage did land a few good films: Cloverfield probably the best of all, Chronicle, and as above so below to name a few. So this film is only ""good"" in the sense that actual competent filmmakers were able to raise the genre to its true potential. However, this genre became so commonplace because of the low cost of production and terrible filming being passed off as a ""film"". Thankfully this trend has pretty much died out and decent horror is being made again."

A few people share their discussion on the legend of the haunted woods. Knuckleheads actually go there. One forgets the compass, loses the map, and hence, they get lost in the last place that they want to get lost. ( Maybe if they just walked in the direction that they parked the car....just saying.)

( Don't mind the body count, either.)"
"elicopperman","6","1","1","10 June 2019"," It Holds Up Just Enough
","Ever since its release 20 years ago, The Blair Witch Project has made history as a cultural horror phenomenon, mainly for how it utilized the found footage genre without showing much of what the real horror is. While it did divide audiences back in the day, the intrigue of the film lies a lot more in what we hear rather than what is actually causing hysteria. It's a testament to how divisive the film is when even though what was videotaped did actually happen in real life, just the thought of what lies out in the middle of nowhere is enough to make one feel at ease.<br/><br/>Now understandably, the film has a very simplistic plot, in which three young filmmakers named Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard seek out the local legend called the Blair Witch infamously located at the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994, but they all disappear and the film plays out as a feature length collection of raw footage based on what they experienced. Admittedly, the film doesn't have a great start, as the leads come off as more annoying and obnoxious than likable and charming, and not much happens besides them goofing off for the first twenty minutes. However, as the film progresses, strange oddities start to occur and slowly heighten the stakes with every passing day. The very idea of being lost in the deep woods can really affect someone mentally, so even without the supernatural aspects, the movie works well in playing with the viewer's expectations with suspenseful tension.<br/><br/>One major problem with most found footage movies is that the creatures feared by the cast are either always seen or are in a typical environment we're all familiar with. The better way to create paranoia within your horror narrative is by placing your characters somewhere they've never been before. Also, the decision to have many of the night scenes be pitch black and out of focus really helps the soundtrack, as all the crazy sounds coming from the area feel all the more terrifying without knowing where they are coming from. What people hear is more reactionary than what they see, and the filmmakers react so well to what they hear that the audience could be in their shoes as well. Even then, as the film goes on, Heather, Mike and Josh become much more relatable with their ever-growing impatience and frustrations with the whole legend itself, whether it's fake or not, and even towards each other with anger and fear. The more away from civilization you are, the less human you become.<br/><br/>So while it may be slow paced and the idea of not seeing the real terror can be a turnoff to some viewers, I definitely think The Blair Witch Project stands well on its own after its original release. Regardless if this whole movie is complete fiction, crafting a whole narrative around the supernatural in a place as unknown as a forest at night can work if you center it around the idea of implication rather than flat out showing the creature. All you need is a shoestring budget, a cast of people you know personally as opposed to famous celebrities, and an environment you're familiar with enough to let your small camera create practically everything. In spite of the found footage genre being somewhat of a joke nowadays, there is nothing stopping you from taking on the challenge of forming a film around raw recorded material."
"azathothpwiggins","7","1","1","7 September 2018"," ""I Want To Really Avoid Any Cheeeze!""...
","After many years, it was time to re-watch THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. First, for the two or three people who don't already know, THE STORY: Three college students- Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, take a trip into the deep woods of Maryland in search of the titular legend. Horror ensues. THE EXECUTION: The preliminary / introductory footage is actually pretty good, including the interviews w/ the locals. Heather's narration is dramatic, but effective enough. Like all ""found footage"" films, the dilemma is how to make it appear realistic, and not like a phony documentary. To make it look as though the dialogue and the actions taken are NOT contrived. Once the group settles into their journey through the woods, the interaction between the trio feels more ""natural"". They start finding various signs, symbols, etc., as agitation w/ each other and their situation sets in. When they decide to stop filming due to strange events, they have difficulty getting back out of the forest, and things grow more frenetic. Not surprisingly, the scary stuff is reserved for nighttime, when the viewer's imagination can fill in any blanks. As they get more desperate, the question becomes, as w/ all similar movies, ""Why are they still filming?"". In a life or death struggle for survival, who the hell keeps the camera rolling? EXAMPLE: Heather screaming her head off while filming her yelling comrades. When more weird symbols are discovered, the group spends a terrifying night in and out of their tent. In utter chaos, running and screaming wildly, Heather, for reasons beyond all human understanding, films it all! Of course, this is explained by Heather's dedication to the project. Back in 1999 this was crazy talk. Today, w/ everyone glued to their smartphones, turning life itself into a video, it actually seems more believable. THE FINALE: As the tension increases, and someone disappears, Heather keeps making her movie. Her big moment of screen-time terror comes into play, and the last roundup occurs. THE VERDICT: TBWP is a simple, enjoyable, supernatural yarn. When it was originally released, it was a victim of its own insane hype. Watching it now, having long forgotten most of the initial ads and ""audience reaction shots"", it's just a fairly frightening, low-budget horror movie. Not a total dud, but certainly not anything extraordinary..."

At the end of the film we can see that Mike is facing the wall because she or whatever can kill the person who is coming down the traps it is a trap.

"zkonedog","6","1","1","4 March 2017"," A Precursor To ""Paranormal Activity"" (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)
","Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise ""Danse Macabre"". In that book, he discusses ""The Blair Witch Project"" as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen. I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Blair Witch"" focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town. At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.<br/><br/>Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing). While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the ""monster behind the door"" (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen. SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings. It's the ultimate ""devil you don't know"" story.<br/><br/>Yet, ""Blair Witch"" also works on a more human-drama level. Much like the later ""Cloverfield"", it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible. As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion. Viewers begin to wonder ""would I react the same way in a similar situation?""<br/><br/>Overall, I was more intrigued by ""Blair Witch"" than anything. It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no ""jump scenes"", etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch. I have also seen the first ""Paranormal Activity"" movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while ""Blair Witch"" has to fight for every inch, so to speak. They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than ""Paranormal"" ever did."
"davidphillips67","7","1","1","3 May 2015"," Simple but effective tactic of preying on peoples fear of the unknown.
","I know the swearing is part of the whole ""experience"" but it detracts from the rest of the production being simple, disturbing and totally believable. Something about uppity females swearing is very unattractive. However, this effort goes to the heart of human fear, that which they cannot see, that which they do not understand and that which they cannot explain in simple and logical ways. Much like the power of religion, fear is baseless yet all pervasive, the very things modern people scorn as hocus pocus or fantasy (god, ghosts, evil spirits) are the same things that will give a well adjusted person the fear this film evokes, it is elemental, the caveman type of fear of the dark, strange noises and""things that go bump in the night"". This is why it works, I watched with a background in emergency medicine, funeral direction and other forensic science experience but it still made me jumpy. That is what a good horror movie is all about, not gore and blood and chainsaws every 5 minutes. Spoiler alert is purely to cover my butt, lol."
"eshaines","7","1","1","5 June 2014"," Fifteen Years Later: Not Terrible for a 60K Budget
","I'm not sure what it is about this film that makes it interesting. By all accounts, it should be quite dull: much of it is shot in motion or out of focus by hand-held cameras, the dialogue is petty and tedious, there's an absence of sexual tension between the main characters, and much of what is feared throughout the film, while eerie, is merely suggestive of horror. Perhaps I am spoiled by modern day horror and suspense films, which are less understated, follow an explicit plot, and don't leave me wanting in terms of visual access. The ""agenda"" of this film is still fear —we are to believe that even after one or two centuries, the so-called ""Blair Witch"" still lives in those woods and is still out to kill, as evidenced by the eerie ending. <br/><br/>An obscurity that doesn't ever quite seem resolved for me, and there is more than one, is what one man at the beginning of the ""documentary"" tells the filmmakers: that a man was found guilty of killing some children and confessed to the crime—are we to think that the witch possessed this killer? Or were these unrelated crimes that just happened to be occurring in the same geographical area? <br/><br/>It also seems to me that all of the folklore and mythology surrounding the Blair Witch deaths pertain to attacks on children—with the one exception of the men tortured on that rock whose bodies later mysteriously disappear—why would the witch go after children for so many years but then in the modern day attack these three grown adults? It is a possible statement that these three filmmakers were so consumed by naiveté and child-like curiosity for the macabre, or a rather dumb, stop-at-nothing passion for art, that they were mistaken for children by the witch, or at least considered to be one in the same. Because really, what thinking, rational adult would so discredit a history of serial killings—just for the reason that its roots were non- scientifically explained—to put themselves in what would potentially be harm's way? Aren't there a million other things to explore and about which to write and direct films? Ridiculous. <br/><br/>This is the second time I've seen this film, the first time being early in high school, for me about thirteen or fourteen years ago. I watched it the first time at night, at a friend's house, and when the movie was over and I had nearly peed myself in fear, never having seen any movie quite like it, she insisted we go to the local woodsy lake area to light some fireworks—naturally I was petrified, tried to convince everyone it was a bad idea, but ended up ignored, and went. That was the first night I forced myself, for my own sanity, to make a distinction between film-based fear projected onto reality, and reality itself. Why would a witch come out of the woods in the middle of Dallas, TX, where I was at the time, when the witch in this film haunts a forest in Maryland, I asked myself. And so I found my firmer footing. It is only now, thirteen years later, in revisiting the movie to see if I still found it as scary, that I have decided to reevaluate it. <br/><br/>I guess I could've done without the foul-mouthed protagonist—why on earth would I empathize with this woman who doesn't know how to speak without dropping an 'f-bomb' every other word? Not that I have a big problem with cursing to convey a certain amount of anger or frustration—but to hear it constantly, it was as if she were beating me over the head with it. Her male counterparts were far better behaved and easier to stomach as characters. <br/><br/>I think that what works about the film is the gradual decay in the lead characters' morale. They begin their adventure peppy, excited, naive, almost cocky—and by the end of the film disintegrate into panic, rage, fear, cynicism, and desperation. I still get a kick out of seeing that extreme close-up of the leading lady in her beanie, only half of her face visible, welling up with tears, whispering: ""I'm afraid to close my eyes, I'm afraid to open them...."" I think it's the first time in the movie one can really feel the film's trademark desperation and isolation these characters must have been internalizing as their project progressed. <br/><br/>The movie's not perfect; there are some things I would've done differently: fewer, but more focused, less scattered interviews with locals (when in doubt, simplify, don't obscure your characters' motivations), interspersing steady cam shots with the hand-held, blurry ones—purely for palatability to the audience (you are trying to achieve the effect of a realistic out-in-the- woods experience, but isn't filmmaking just as much about satisfying an audience as pleasing the filmmaker?); some more clues as to what happened to Josh; and maybe, if the steady cam shots were included, when Mike drops the camera at the end, there would be a way to show the climax of the film without the girl having to pick up the camera herself and film—it is simply not believable that, in this state of panic, after having formally apologized to her and her colleagues' parents for her stubborn will to make this film, she would still want to film what was at that point a very desperate and unpleasant situation. For a budget of $60,000, I think they did a great job, though.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I still won't be going on a hike in the unpaved, unmarked woods any time soon. In that regard, hats off to the writers and directors of this movie. Fifteen years later, and it still has that effect!"

""The Blair Witch Project"" is a movie that still affects me now. Like the people in the audience, I feel like I need to laugh it off, or say something like, ""Heather was so annoying.""  The simple truth is, though, that the movie absolutely terrified me.  Why exactly, I have few clues.  A friend of mine who attended the movie made fun of my slacked jaw and tight grip on the armrests.  He didn't think much of the movie(He likes ""Pet Cemetary."").<br/><br/>That is why it is hard to decide whether or not to recommend the film.  Alot is made of things in the movie that go against typical ""lost in the middle of nowhere"" films.  Maybe the movie's lack of standard cliches, and it's ""Spinal Tap"" innovative approach is what draws the critical acclaim.  I guess horror, like humour, is subjective.  Some people are scared of people in hockey masks with chainsaws.  Some people are scared of things that go bump in the night.  For me(and the young lady behind me who jolted loudly in her seat during the last 15 minutes), I think the scariest thing is the idea that strange things are out there, and there is absolutely nothing you or your friends can do about it.<br/><br/>Some things about the movie bothered me, technically.  The camera's constant movement was perhaps too real, and I struggled frequently to make out some of the strange things that the group finds in the film.  I was unclear about one particular detail towards the end involving a bundle of sticks(I will say no more to avoid any kind of spoiler).<br/><br/>The bottom line:  The movie may scare the pants off you.  You may find it silly.  It could be just ""all right.""  All anyone can do is say what they thought of it.

The film begins with a search team going to look for them, then recovering the footage, integrating both the real-time plot as well as the previous footage into the film.  Enjoy Blair Witch, but give its predecessor its due...."

","after the all the hype of the blair witch, i expected to leave the theater in complete fright.  but instead, i left with a boggled mind.  since the ending of the movie was only round 7 minutes long, i feel that if the tape ran for at least five more minutes, it would have easily been one of the scariest movies i have ever seen.  but when the movie ended i could not help but think.  rolling stone said ""scary as hell.""  did they see a different screening that was longer.  i feel that the ny post said it perfectly with ""creepy to the bone."""

","The Blair Witch Project, it makes you question yourself: Am I ever going to camp in the woods ever again? Take a hike in a forest with a reputation of unexplained deaths? Not over my dead body. The movie leaves you unsettling. No closure for the answer. You want to see what is actually happening but, there is nothing to see, only to listen to the horrifying screams. For that, is the reason I love this movie."

","Overall I thought it was a good movie, different of course, and a brilliant concept of taking the three actors and putting them in a situation that they would have to basically improv.  However, the thought was always in my mind that it was not real.  If I had thought it was a true story, I never would have slept again!  And I know I will think about this movie next time I am camping.  But as I watched this movie, I would try to put myself in the students' shoes for a second, and I was scared out of my mind, especially at the end.  I really enjoyed the beginning parts of the movie that lead up to the three kids going into the woods...not only were their funny parts but it seemed like it was real at the same time.  The original idea of this movie is what I like the most about it.  If you are a person that gets easily frightened whether it's a real story or not, expect to look over shoulder for a while after you see the Blair Witch Project.  If you don't get easily frightened, even this movie will make you think twice about going into the woods again."
"Larry-17","8","1","1","4 August 1999"," A very good film that might have been better...
","Before anything else, let me say that I liked the film.    Nice concept. Well executed.   In particular, I appreciate that the film makers leave the central enigma of the movie intact.  Peter Weir's in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""  makes a similar choice.  It takes strength of character and confidence to make this kind of choice.  It speaks reams about their potential.<br/><br/>Already a thing of talk among independent filmfolk long before it hit theaters, BWP had poked itself into my consciousness a year or so ago.  The buzz.  The buzz!   A website before it was a film.  The website, itself, less a billboard than a computer game.   The lore:  Really cheaply made -- 60 grand, 25 grand, 10 grand! for crineoutloud -- the whole thing improved in the woods in eight wet and stinky days; they gave a trio of actors a couple of cameras and a DAT, led them on a scavenger hunt for clues, left sketchy notes and mind-screwed the cast into near-real fear and panic and late night woodland snipe-hunts.  It was all so hip, so coolly generated, so clever.   Forget that it had been done before.  Forget ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and others...this one had integrity and a kind of kick-ass honesty about it. Just following all the material about the film before it opened, you just knew that -- if successful -- it was going to be one of those demiurge filmevents that redefined the business and would spawn a thousand mini-urges flailing for a ride.<br/><br/>The buzz and hype!  And it's all true.  There it is: kind of lovely and clever.  It HAS integrity.   You like those three people.  You buy their weaknesses and still you like them because they're weak like you are weak. They're jerks, but still you like them because they're jerks like all of us.<br/><br/>The actors are good, the self-revelatory stuff is honest -- forget how they did it.   (John Ford gave Victor McLaglen the next day off and got him drunk as a skunk the night before the big trial scene in ""The Informer.""  Crack of day the next day, Ford dragged McLaglen out of bed and shoved him in front of the camera.  Sleep-stupid and whisky-blubbering, fuzz-gargling his lines, shaking all outside and in, McLaglen acted his way through the day and earned an OscarÂ™ for his hangover.)<br/><br/>So there!  Who cares how they got there, they got there!<br/><br/>And there it was.  The personal hype machine worked well for these guys, the short booking worked for them boosting their per screen opening to stratospheric levels.  Great.<br/><br/>I still went in thinking the movie was going to be just okay.  It was better.  It was very good.  They might have done a little more with the sound.  They might have built the tension a little more.  They might have paced it better.  They might have...  They could have-should have...<br/><br/>Well.  It worked.<br/><br/>I will say: I came out of the theater not frightened but moved.  I left the theater more impressed with the film makers than their film.   Ah, phooey! It was a good night out.<br/><br/>It is, finally, a very good film that could have been better."

"Mike-866","Null","1","1","4 August 1999"," Its a great experience...if the audience works with it.
","The Blair Witch Project reminds me of the old camping days, where you sit around the campfire and tell scary ghost stories. These stories work when everybody lets themselves be absorbed into the story, letting go of critical thought.  Then, at the end, the audience is startled back into reality.<br/><br/>The good thing is that ""Blair Witch"" has a good story.  Its not very original, for there are many ""mysterious-happenings-in-the -woods"" stories told around many campfires.  But they are all scary when you let yourself be scared, and this one is no different.  The cinematography sometimes gets in the way of this, but usually it does add to the anxious mood of the film (and that's good).  And just like those old campfire stories everything comes together at the end, with frighteningly good results.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Blair Witch"" is that, in a theater (just like at the campfire), there is always somebody that has to talk or laugh inappropriately.  I don't mean nervous laughter (plenty of that in this film) or genuine laughter at the funny scenes (got those too).  And there are many times where the audience, as a whole, will react with anxiety/fear or laughter.  I mean annoying commentary and/or cell phones (shut yours off).  The audience needs to be quiet to hear those sounds in the woods that only Heather seems to hear.  <br/><br/>When you get absorbed into it, ""Blair Witch"" is a great movie with a fantastic ending.  Campfire tales thrive off of the idea that they are real stories.  If you can't do that, then the movie becomes very familiar, too predictable, and unenjoyable.  You paid to be scared, so relax and let yourself go!"
"Frag God","Null","1","1","4 August 1999"," Best way to prepare yourself to watch this movie
","I saw this movie at the midnight show of opening night. Unfortunately, everyone else in town had heard of it too, so the theater was sold out. Although it was not actually ""scary"", I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was the most suspenseful film I have seen in a very long time... if not ever.<br/><br/>So anyway, here are some tips I believe would make the viewing of this film as enjoyable as possible. <br/><br/>1. Go when there are the fewest other people around. This probably involves going during the day or afternoon.  The fewer people in the room with you to distract you by lauging/coughing/answering cell phones the better.  The crowded theater effect does not help in this case, it hurts it. The feeling of isolation and being lost are what you're going for.<br/><br/>2. Try not to anticipate what is going to happen. Don't try to fit in the short clips from the previews and figure out where you think it's headed. Just let the movie lead you along.<br/><br/>3. Sit near the front of the theater. The sound only came out of the front row of speakers in the room I was in, so it was often hard to hear what was being said from where I was in the back. The volume is not very loud to begin with, because it is realisticly recorded from the videocamera's microphone.<br/><br/>4. Have an open mind. This is not a regular movie. There are absolutely no computer generated graphics to awe at. There are no giant explosions or shootouts. The greatness of this movie is in the realism of the scripting and the acting. Consider it a work of art, something that belongs in a film festival and somehow escaped.<br/><br/>5. Make it real in your mind. There seems to be much controversy over how much of this movie is based on real events. Most of the information available on the web indicates that it contains real footage. The disclaimer at the end of the credits states that it is entirely fiction, although probably for legal purposes. The bottom line is, the more real you make it in your head, the more intense and thus more entertaining it will be.  Just get it in your head before the film starts that everything you see really happened/is happening as you watch it.  You will have as much of a look of agony and fear on your face as the characters on the screen!<br/><br/>6. Go to the bathroom before you the movie starts.  I don't know how long this movie is, but it seemed to fly by. This movie builds its suspense slowly and just keeps growing the longer it goes on. You don't want to be interrupted for anything."

","I must admit, this movie was not what I'd expected.  I had figured that I would constantly be looking over my shoulder, waiting for something to jump out at me.  But, it never happened.  Don't get me wrong, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is an enjoyable movie.  The actors are fantastic, and although their sense of fear and desperation was never completely transferred to me, it was hard to tell that this was only fiction.  I just did not find it as terrifying as so many folks have claimed it to be.  However, I do find it effective in one area, which is perhaps the intended point:  ""The Blair Witch Project"" will do for going into the woods what ""Jaws"" did for going into the water."

Its hard to describe how it did it but it really creeped me out and the final scene gave me chills the next day. I really liked the sound fx also. Its not a typical horror film which is a good thing. It seems that most of the people who really hated it are wannabe film makers and the reason for that is the simplicity of it. A lot of people could have made this movie as far as the cost/equipment goes. It was the idea and execution of it that made it work so well and that is talent.<br/><br/>Hank"
"Linz-5","Null","1","1","3 August 1999"," The hype over BWP defies the very principle the movie follows - fear of the unknown.
","I found this movie really intriguing quite some time before everyone started throwing a fit about it and hyping it up and stuff.  I was so anxious to see it, but I couldn't get anyone to see it with me.  To satisfy my curiousity, I read everything I could get my hands on about it, particularly the user comments here on IMDb.  More than once, I was advised not to learn anything more about it, to see the movie with as little knowledge about it as possible.  I didn't listen to these warnings, and now that I've seen the movie, I regret learning about it first!  I knew about almost everything that was going to happen, and I think it was for that reason that I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be (though that's not saying much - it still scared me more than any other horror movie I've seen to date - I tried to put my glasses back in their case and I had to wait a few minutes, because my hands were shaking so badly).  So take my advice, if you're anything like me - DON'T READ THE SPOILERS.  If you're willing to resist reading all the information out there, be as ignorant about The Blair Witch Project as you possibly can.  It will make seeing it many times better, and scarier."

","It's probably not coincidence that my favourite films of recent years have been independent ones - for example, My Name is Joe, and Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.<br/><br/>This one is on a similar vein - low budget, actors you've probably never heard of, and not necessarily your regular happy ending.  Blair Witch takes it further - as well as enough hype to take it way up the box office charts, you're left wondering 'was it real?'. The actors are credited as themselves, the official web site (www.blairwitch.com) contains news footage of the search for the three filmmakers, and has no mention of actually making the film.  Call me gullible, but I'm still not 100% sure!<br/><br/>As for the fear factor?  I saw the movie at a matinee, so the cinema wasn't too full, but even the few folk who were doing a bit of heckling during the film were silent for the final ten minutes, right through the credits, and people only started moving after the lights went up.  I didn't really find the movie too creepy, but 5 hours after I saw it, I've not had time to think it through properly.

","My wife and I saw this movie recently and both agreed that it was certainly an effective and eerie movie. While it will not ""scare"" adults (does anything scare adults?) it does manage to make one remember the childhood feeling of being scared of something one cannot see. The idea is a very good one and the execution is flawless. Viewers of this movie seem to be split into two camps: those who love it and those who just ""don't get it."" I think the problem for the latter group is that they cannot let themselves get involved in a movie to the degree required by this movie or have never really been alone in the woods for an extended period of time. I camp in the woods quite regularly and appreciate both the awe and fear that nature can inspire. To enjoy this movie, one only need appreciate that every Hollywood cliche has been studiously avoided, appreciate the method acting, and enjoy the unexpected ending. The ending is scary because you're expecting (dying, actually, by that time) to see something, but what you finally see is scarier than what you thought you were going to see. This is one of the few movies in a long time to end EXACTLY where it should. It will be interesting to see if the Academy remembers this enjoyable and extremely effective exercise in fear when it is time to hand out awards!"

","This film made me feel like a kid again.  I mean this because I haven't slept a sound night for four days counting.  The last time this happened was when I saw Halloween when I was nine.  My electrical bill will be bigger than normal as I've left a light on every night.  The film really hit me at my most vulnerable fears.  I really don't like camping and waking up to the sound of something outside.  In the film, every time the camera turned on in the tent at night, my eyes rolled and I thought, ""Will this film ever let my heartbeat return to normal?"" It still hasn't!  It was truly a frightening experience.  I'm glad I got into it and read a lot about the movie before I saw it.  A few people I know who saw it expected the standard Hollywood film and were a bit confused by what was happening.  They didn't quite understand that it was supposed to be actual footage.  I explained things to them and told them to give it another try.  We saw it on opening night and when we came out afterword and saw everyone in line, they stared at us and realized that nobody who just saw it was even talking.  They noticed our white faces and I even heard some comment on our condition.  What a great experience! What a chiller!

","Many may find the shower scene in Psycho, the shark attacks in Jaws, the breakdown of Jack Nicholson in The Shining, or Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs more creepy than this indie film, but I disagree.  Never before have I felt so uncomfortable, so shocked, so disturbed, and so intense after seeing this film.  And for some reason, after feeling all that even now (4 days later), I'm dying to see it again.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is best left unknown for those who haven't seen it. The less you know about the film the better, because some of the best parts would feel rather lame if you knew it was coming.  The last 45 minutes of the film I sat there with my hand over my mouth wandering what would happen next and truly caring for the students.  There wasn't a script written for this film nor was there a storyboard to decide the events, it is all incredibly realistic with no hocus pocus or special effects.  It costs the price of a car to make this film and it shows how brilliant the directors are when someone like Wes Craven or John Carpenter can't come close to frieghtening us as much as this film does, despite the millions they can put into their films.<br/><br/>Not everyone will like this film, however those who don't like it can't criticize it.  For those that think they can, they minus well shut the hell up and look at the originality and differences this film has to every other horror film out there.  This is definatly a film to see in theaters because not only is the sound an important aspect of the film but it's so amazing to sit there and notice how quiet a sold out audience will be while watching this film, you could hear a pin drop.

The best part about ""Blair Witch"" is the fact that the ending and conclusion are left completely to the audiences imagination. As we drove back home to our houses (conveniently found in the woods)we tried to scare the wits out of one another discussing the truly disturbing ending.

I think it's just amazing that 2 dudes blew their last bit of cash and made a really different and fun horror movie. The hype and gimmickery were relatively minimal and fueled almost entirely by the fact that this film got people talking. Sheesh, I mean there weren't even television ads until a couple of days ago! How can anyone who endures an incessant pummeling of Star Wars and Disney crap on everything from watches to coloring books to freakin Mcdonald's cups even begin to say that The Blair Witch Project is somehow especially hyped?<br/><br/>
Before filmakers stopped being storytellers and became illusionists, movies had to use the audiences' imagination, character development, and solid fiction to create cinema. In this age of horror movies that rely solely on teenage cleavage and cat scares, I am excited and moved by the fact that a teeny movie (that is, granted, a bit hard on the attention span at times) has completely exploded. And it's not because kids are whining for the Happy Meals, but because it for the most part is interesting and accomplishes something new. People are talking about it. I'm going to see it again ASAP. I have included some replies to other's posts below:<br/><br/>Right now, it is apparently ""hip"" to really dig this movie, and say you've seen it and loved it.<br/><br/>Invariably, as something becomes popular, those among us indeed ""too hip"" for their our good will bring things full circle and begin to dislike things for the sake of being contrary.                               <br/><br/><br/><br/>""Wouldn't these idiots put down their cameras if they knew they were being hunted?""

""They have done a great job marketing, and limiting theatre access (to get long lines, etc.), but the big joke is, this movie is horrible.""<br/><br/>Once again, there is a website.

I was really excited about seeing the movie...and had heard excellent reviews. I really didn't find it scarey or intense. First of all..this supposed legend of the Blair witch was not properly explained AT ALL! What in the hell kind of Documentary were they DOING? about what? some children who got killed? or some guys who got their intestines ripped out? BY WHO? It just didn't make much sense to me. I guess I was expecting some really intense moments..but most of them were pretty lighthearted, reminded me more of videos I have taken myself while in college. WHAT EXACTLY DO PEOPLE FIND SO SCAREY AND INTENSE ABOUT THIS MOVIE??? Other than some moaning or footsteps heard while looking at a black movie screen..Nothing much happens, untill Their friend Josh disappears..However I found it really strange that the other two don't seem terribly worried about him..I mean it shows them later the next day..Reminiscing about their hobbies...and joking around..HMMMMMMMM if you thought witches were stalking you, and suddenly your friend just disappears in the middle of the night..WOULD YOU BE IN THE MOOD TO TALK ABOUT YOUR HOBBIES? I don't know..perhaps I'm too critical...I did think there were a few eerie moments toward the end...BUT I WANTED TO SEE MORE...I don't feel there was enough explanation...or Intensity in the movie..For what its worth..SAVE YOUR MONEY..and if you really want to see it..WAIT FOR VIDEO!"

","My enjoyment of The Blair Witch Project was reduced somewhat by a bit of motion sickness from watching the camera bouncing about, but mainly from a couple of teenage girls behind me, commenting on proceedings throughout. Kinda ruins the ""suspension of disbelief"" necessary to really get into the picture. Given the small budget/small screen nature of the film, I think this will convert really well to home video. Then, without interruption, you could turn out the lights and scare the hell out of yourself. My hair stood on end during the final walk through the house."
"derek-42","Null","1","1","2 August 1999"," Scary as hell.
","Where do we go from here in the horror genre?  Psychological and emotional manipulation, that's where.  The Blair Witch Project concentrated all of it's efforts to do one thing: make the audience feel scared.  While it fits perfectly within the time line of popular media -- video: Cops, Real World, America's Scariest Home Video's -- it still exhibits the professionalism that a well thought out story does.  It is a one-up on the ultimate campfire campfire story.  Undoubtedly more frightening than The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project is a revolution in filmmaking.  It is a sign of the times. <br/><br/>We want to be scared, Alfred Hitchcock style."
"Rusty-61","Null","1","1","2 August 1999"," try to ignore the hype and just keep an open mind.
","First, I feel like I have to address the buzz surrounding the movie. I am at the same time disgusted and sort of impressed with the hype. It is pretty clever when you think about it. No trailers (well, they are showing one now, but still, it took them long enough) no cast members doing the rounds on talk shows, no big budget, etc. Just the website, the documentary on the SciFi channel, and bigtime word of mouth. It sure worked. I feel for those actors, since they got paid about what I make in 2 weeks for 3 weeks of hell.  I hope to God the filmmakers were generous and gave them points in the film. I am also hearing that at most theaters, they pay the manager, etc to get up before the showing and get the crowd all hyped up, which is kind of lame. When we saw it Saturday, the owner (before she threatened people who had laser pointers) got up and yelled, ""Hey, welcome to Crossroads theater, and ARE YA READY FOR THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?? Whooooo-hoooo! Everyone READY TO BE SCARED?"" I was like, oh please. I also heard these girls in front of me asking someone next to them if **this was a real documentary**. We got up and moved because I did not want to spend the movie sitting behind someone so incredibly stupid and naive. But I guess that's what a good job they did marketing it, because I heard there are plenty of stupid people out there who think the thing is real.  I also grudgingly admire whoever decided to market it initially as a 'hard ticket', meaning they wanted to have it only at one theater or so per city for a few weeks. I'm sure that helped the buzz.  Hyping it as the scariest movie of all time (though maybe this is more word of mouth than the filmmakers doing it) is kind of dumb, though, because people are just going to be disapointed, unless all they've seen are ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". I heard kids talking after the movie who were let down because they was very little gore, no monster, and no real pay-off. I had a good time because I told myself not to expect anything. I guess if you go, just keep an open mind, and don't think, ""This better be the scariest movie of all time after all the hype, or I'll be p**sed"". I do think it's kind of funny how the big studios spend millions of dollars marketing their lame summer 'event' pics, but this is the one most people are talking about wanting to see.<br/><br/>
So, that's my 2 cents as far as the hype goes.  Went and saw BWP for myself this weekend.  Inside the theater manager had to come make an announcement about laser pointers, she said if anyone used them during the movie she'd take them away and kick them out. She was this huge, burly, tough woman who looked like a prison warden so people calmed down after that and shut up.  Anyway, I loved it. Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but if you asked me what the scariest movie I've ever seen was, I wouldn't be able to name it. I would saw BWP, the Exorcist, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Last House on the Left (and a couple more I can't think of right now) are like the top scariest.  I was really impressed though. Very realistic, the way it was shot and put together, and the character's reactions to stuff. My spouse said it really scared him, which he hardly ever says, because he's been camping and that's like your worst nightmare. The whole movie was very creepy and spooky but the last 5 minutes REALLY scared the crap out of me.<br/><br/>It's funny, the audience started out very rowdy, and I thought I'd have to ""shhh"" people the whole movie. But after the first 5 minutes, people were engrossed. As the film got more and more tense and scary, there were no screams. Instead, the whole audience just sat there cowering quietly in fear. Not a lot of talking back to the screen, etc like there is in most horror movies, and the audience was full of teenagers. That speaks for itself, I think.<br/><br/>I read a review in which they said that the movie was all about panic, and I agree. One of the most upsetting things is the way the charcters go from calm, controlled, and joking, to nervously joking and then arguing, to trying desperately to hold it together, to understandable total freaked out panic by the last reel. As the film draws to a close they just give up all pretenses of composure and control and just panic and run around like maniacs screaming incoherently at the top of their lungs. Usually when characters in a movie do that you feel like slapping them, but the film draws you in so much that you do not blame them, one bit. You know you would probably act the same way if you were in their shoes, and the way the movie is filmed, you are pretty much in their shoes.<br/><br/>Bottom line regarding how scary it is: If I'd been watching it by myself at home at night I probably would have started crying."
"loud6969","9","1","1","2 August 1999"," Finally a movie worthy of an 8 dollar ticket price.
","This film is frightening.  It's not the visuals that make it but the lack thereof in much of the film.   The film relies on the audience's imagination rather than expensive effects to scare the audience and is very successful. The audio in many scenes is absolutely chilling.  This is a very well done and thought out film.  Much better than the majority of the ""Horror"" movies churned out by Hollywood lately.  Where films like ""Anaconda"" and ""Event Horizon"" fail with a huge budget and special effect this movie succeeds with a very low budget and NO special effects."

"HutDing","9","1","1","2 August 1999"," Didn't think it was scary enough? Read below...
","I just returned from seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and it scared the pants off of me.  I've read some negative comments, but I think those people didn't understand the end of the film. As soon as I saw that last shot, a chill went down my spine, and I knew that image would be imbedded in my mind for days. Those that didn't feel that way should see the movie again and pay closer attention to the beginning. I would like to add that I don't think being frightened by the film determines whether or not you have an imagination...it's merely a testament as to what truly frightens you.  I was deathly scared of the dark when I was young, but I wasn't scared of what I saw...I was scared of what I couldn't see.  That is what the film makers were attempting with ""Blair Witch,"" and I think they pulled it off well."
"slug-12","Null","1","1","2 August 1999"," The Finest Horror Film To Date!
","I call this the finest horror film to date as a way of respecting the sheer genius of the filmmaking.  Not relying on the typical horror scare tactics, director Dan Myrick and Eduard Sanchez have not only created an amazing psychological terror, but a complex character on the deterioration of three regular people.  The situations called for the same reactions the characters gave; a feat seldom accomplished in the sometimes phony, sometimes mesmerizing word of Hollywood realism.  This is my favorite American film of the year, thus far.  A terrific movie!"
"Swampfox","Null","1","1","2 August 1999"," DO NOT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM OR IT WILL DISAPPOINT
","That said, I have to say I was disappointed. On the day when the public finally got to see the year's most anticipated ""serious"" film from a dead director, I was anticipating the scariest film about the dead. In other words, this was a film I wanted to like, wanted to get sucked in to and wanted to have scare the bejeezus out of me. When the lights came up after finally seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I found I only liked the first half, was only sucked in occasionally and never once felt anything than some mild creepiness.<br/><br/>All those clamoring about the film on the internet may or no be real (there's talk in the entertainment industry that much the buzz was planted by the distributor), but the initial reaction at film festivals last winter was undoubtedly uncoached. Thinking that this 80 minute mixed media movie is real would probably make most viewer's skin crawl. But once that cat's out of the bag (and even the most cursory glance at articles about this film give that away), the big gimmick  turns out to be the biggest thing going for it. Not the only thing, but it can't drive the film anymore once a viewer is no longer scammed into thinking the ""In 1994 three student filmmakers went into..."" is on the level. <br/><br/>All the shots used in promotional stories about ""The Blair Witch Project"" are not used in the actual film. It begins with the same preamble that adorns the poster and ad copy. This is a mistake, as it shows a lack of foresight on the filmmakers' part. They should have realized that only the first audience would benefit from complete ignorance, the rest of us might need a sequence that builds the idea that what we are seeing is real. The distributor is obviously trying to sustain the illusion: at my screening a booklet proclaiming itself as the Blair Witch Dossier was given to us in line. Inside are notes from fictitious private investigators and class statements written by the ""missing filmmakers."" If only this had been included in the movie.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing about the film (after the chutzpah of its filmmakers) is the improvisation of the actors. There are scenes that rang so true that I will not be surprised next winter if one of the endless series of awards given out goes to one of the three faux documentarians. One scene that starts with gallows humor and ends in near fisticuffs affirmed that those magical moments of theater or recorded acting can still pull us out of our seats. On the basis of it alone I can see why the uninformed would take the events at face value.<br/><br/>As with most, ""Blair Witch's"" undoing is its last act. As events unfold, the filmmakers repeatedly squander the tension that has gripped the audience. Perhaps a little too attuned to the aesthetics of the documentary-within-a-film they have created, they let its sensibilities guide how they shape the events of the last 20 minutes. Too much of the ""found"" footage is allowed to unreel, loosing the dramatic build-up. And after all this overage, the ending is abrupt and confusing. There isn't a single back story to the legend of the Blair Witch but three, which undermines the payoff. We never see anything of the ""presence"" that is pursuing them through the woods, so it's hard to even begin to debate if it is supernatural or not. If not for a friend seeing it with me, I'm not sure how long it would have been before I ""got"" the ending."

But after months of hype on a Saturday afternoon it just wasn't that spectacular.  Of course the idea is genius, and the shaking camera shots made it seem like a spooky home video.

The characters progress from ambitious, if not over-confident  filmmakers into scared, hunted animals. This progression is one of the main points in the film since we get to view it in full detail. The scares are not of the ""jump-out-at-you"" variety but are more haunting since you must think about the film to really understand it's terrifying uniqueness. I would encourage anyone to go see this movie because it is so full of originality and it is certainly like no horror movie you have ever seen. I agree with most that say the final frame is one that is burned into your mind and stays there for a time after you have viewed the film. Truly a psychological scare in top form."

","Every once in a while a movie will come along that will make America re-assess the way it looks at parts of life they encounter on an every day basis. For example, in the aftermath of such genius as the original ""Psycho"" (1960), America lay witness to an actual recorded drop in the amount of women who took showers instead of baths. After a movie like ""Jaws"" people were forced to think twice before entering the seemingly peaceful ocean. And now after viewing the shockingly original and very independent ""Blair Witch Project"" (it had a $75,000 budget)and after seeing its opening weekend figures I am positive that this movie will make the country if not the world afraid to enter the woods at night. The acting is so good that it borders on genuine and the idea is so original and successful because it shies away from the horror-genre cliches that would usually appear in a movie that takes place in a wooded setting. Not only is ""The Blair Witch Project"" one of the best summer movies ever, it is also scary enough to change the way horror movies are made in the future. God bless independent film."

It stuck with me for days after seeing it and I think I even offered to personally give some people their money back if they didn't like the film (although I'm just going to say I was drunk if they come to collect). It's refreshing to see and be scared by a flick that sports a bundle of sticks and piles of rocks and snot as major special effects.

Probably not the scariest movie ever, in the standard sense of the word.  But, what this movie does is follow you out of the theatre, into your car, back home, and into your dreams.

We are also never given any easy answers about what is happening.  We know exactly what the students know, which is really very little.  My only complaint is that the camera work was so jumpy at times that it made it hard to focus on the screen.  However, this is just me being very picky.

The story line was very boring, the ""effects"" were barely there, and the horror part of the film the film makers were trying to get across never happened. This ""film"" was too predictable and you could see the ending coming a mile away. Another major downside to the film was the constant back and forth swaying of the camera, true this was supposed to be a documentary but after 15 minutes into the film I had to look away for a few minutes to focus on something that wasn't constantly moving a 100mph! I walked away with a headache and 4.50 poorer. Don't go see this one folks, don't even wait till it comes out on video. Here's an indication that a great deal of other people have the similar opinion as I do...I when to try to see it on opening night, it was sold out an hour before it was supposed to start. So I go the next day buy my tickets in advance and when I do go to see it I have no problem finding a good seat with no one in front of me, hmmmmm...could it be that after the majority of die hard film fans saw the very same movie as I was about to see and then after clearly seeing that it was a complete joke told everyone else the same? I think so, it's just too bad that one of them didn't get back to me in time."
"DoctorJ-2","Null","1","1","2 August 1999"," Sometimes tedious, but an ending which provides pure horror
","First off, I have to say that I am quite relieved that someone finally said that this movie draws inspiration from Cannibal Holocaust. I have been saying that ever since I learned the premise of the film. Some people also mentioned a little known recent movie called Final Broadcast or something like that...but it also draws from Deodatos Italian gore fest due to the same ""find dead persons film watch what happened to them"". That out of the way lets proceed to some analysis.<br/><br/>Regarding the camerawork, the camcorder is shaky at times...but its nothing that a t.v show like Cops doesn't have either..if anything the two creators should have shelled out an extra 100$ or so to give Heather some lessons in camerawork. The B&W 16mil camera is just fine.<br/><br/>As for the plot and pacing of the movie, the middle part of the movie does drag on sometimes, but there is at least one scene where they are in the tent that is very frightening. But the middle part of the movie can be summarized thus: get lost, argue, get more lost, stay in tent, get scared, get lost, argue some more etc. etc.<br/><br/>The acting is just fine and its one of the high points for me. Besides some of the secondary characters in the beginning of the movie (which are laughably bad actors and detract from the movie)the main characters themselves act very convincingly. I kept thinking if me and my friends did get in that situation that is exactly how we would act. Some criticism is aimed at how Heather keeps filming through all thats happened, critics claim it is too contrived. Well those critics have never seen any war footage or footage of riots were journalists keep filming while under fire or attack. This is the same situation: Heather and those journalists want to keep filming because thats what they do! They want to go down in history and get that amazing footage.<br/><br/>And as for the finale...it is pure visceral horror...."
"STPFan","9","1","1","2 August 1999"," A new disturbing genre is born & Hollywood should be scared!
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a masterpiece in its own right. The movie is laid out like a student documentary would be. The interaction between the characters is truly realistic from friendly exchanges to mild distress to pure fear. The mysterious disappearance of Josh induces a true array of human reactions in Heather and Mike. This movie leaves you with a chilling climax without the use of computer graphics or blood squibbs. In fact, the psychology of the last chilling schene is what scares you, not the visuals. In addition, every little detail has a significance and returns later in the film to provide a sense of closure.<br/><br/>Hollywood is full of the notion that higher budget will mean better box office results. Due to this, Hollywood is only interested in making movies with large budgets and famous stars. This movie had a miniscule budget and no-name actors and is turning heads left and right. I feel the quality of acting in this film is almost unparalleled with any other movie I have ever seen. I hope that Heather Donahue and Michael C. Williams are nominated for Best Actress and Actor. Joshua Leonard also deserves an Oscar nod for Best supporting Actor for his performance in this phenomenal film.<br/><br/>But this won't happen. There is too much  Academy to entertain. They will take the latest realease from a major studio for consideration. This new type of ""real life"" motion picture should be a wake up call that big budget, action packed films are on their way out.<br/><br/>There are signs though that Hollywood is a little bit intimidated by BLAIR. Dream Works was afraid that their latest offering, ""The Haunting,"" would not be as popular due to its opening against BLAIR. Universal Pictures delayed the release of ""Mystery Men"" a week to prevent it from being slaughtered by BLAIR.<br/><br/>My only complaint lies with the theater where I saw this film. I sat 5 rows from the front and I got motion sickness and eye strain from the wobbly camera. I really can't complain about the camera because it did create the mood and tone for the picture. Please, if you see this film and plan to sit in the front, take some motion sickness patches!"

That this did not happen, at least for me, is a startlingly important thing.  I think this is one of the most gripping films I have seen in years, and I believe it marks a real marriage of concept and execution that the studios would do well to at least attempt to recapture.

And the fact that there is no soundtrack to spice things up only adds to the seeming reality of it all.  I would not, however, recommend this movie for anyone that gets queasy easily, not because of any gore or blood in the movie (in fact, there's barely any of that), but because of the shakiness of the camera throughout the film.

People who haven't grown sick of Hollywood potty-training will not be able to appreciate something as inventive as this.  Ironically, you could criticize the film for not having much of a plot and that the characters don't act logically. But the film perfectly emulates real life which isn't plotted and people frequently aren't logical under such stress.  We can only make those criticisms because we are outside viewers.  To enjoy this film, you have can't set yourself ""above"" it an expect to be entertained.<br/><br/>I saw the movie with a friend who found it plenty disturbing.  His summary was ""the perfect example of how three inexperienced people who have NO business being in the woods in the first place royally screw themselves over.""  I agree.  I almost burst into tears along with the students when they encountered the log crossing they'd been at earlier in the day and realized they'd been going in circles.  Witch legend or not, this should be a testament to anyone who wants to go jaunting off into the deep woods without any serious preparation or at least a local guide in an unfamiliar area.<br/><br/>As for whatever was stalking them, well that was the truly disturbing part. The ending was terrifying, and utterly confusing at the same time.  Those who didn't like the endingÂ… well, the film said that these students disappeared and were never found.  It didn't say that they died, although I'm certain that's what happened to them.  People don't disappear and leave tidy explanations as to what happened to them.  I found myself haunted by this film long after I left the theater, and I had anxiety dreams about it all night.<br/><br/>Bravo to Haxan Films.  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to the Holly-hacks that have reduced the so-called ""horror genre"" to cheap scares, gore, CGI unbelievability, and gratuitous wise-cracks and laugh lines."
"Kelly G.","9","1","1","2 August 1999"," A new classic with only two minor flaws.
","Since my comment will be buried under hundreds of others within weeks of it's posting, I'll keep it very brief.<br/><br/>First of all, it's a classic. It met almost all of my expectations that the last three months of underground hype built up. Seeing this, I felt exhilarated that I was watching horror movie history unfold. It was kind of the equivalent of taking Mr. Peabody's Way-Back machine to the 60's to see the original ""Psycho"", or to the 70's to see ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".<br/><br/>I only had two, VERY MINOR, problems.<br/><br/>#1. The sound level. I know the directors wanted this to seem very real, and that digitizing the sound would have ruined the realism. But the movie was so quiet, I felt they lost an opportunity to utilize the sophisticated sound systems that most theatres have. The low volume also makes it possible to hear what other moviegoers are saying. I saw the movie in a packed house at midnight, and unfortunatly just a few jerk-off screen talkers who kept laughing at inappropriate moments almost totally ruined the vibe of the film. That's why I wanted it louder, I wanted something to drown them out.<br/><br/>#2. I wanted a bit more back story. I knew that the web site to the film had lots of neat information about the town history of massacres, and how the tapes were found. To my surprise, almost none of that was in the film. Now I know that part of what makes this so scary is it's self-contained ambiguity. But I still wanted a little more near the beginning about the history of the town. The fact that the producers leaned too hard on the website for details was the one element of it's promotion I didn't care for.<br/><br/>But as I said above, these are very minor quibbles that didn't keep me from enjoying what, ten years from now, will be considered to be a classic."

","I was disappointed with how little ""The Blair Witch Project"" scared me.  I felt like they concentrated too much on the being lost parts rather than the being stalked parts (which were truly creepy).  It woulda been cool if during the day, they could hear something following them but couldn't see anything.  When they stop, it stops, if they reverse, it reverses. Something like that.  It was a really good movie, though.  Original to say the least.  I'd put it on the scare-o-meter level with ""Jaws"" and ""Psycho"", but much lower than ""The Shining"", ""Halloween"" and ""Alien"".  Hopefully the inevitable copycats to follow will be really good and old-school scary.  I will say this; though, I think ""The Blair Witch Project"" has the scariest ending I've ever seen.  On the other hand, the scariest beginning I've ever seen was ""The Hitcher"" which, after the first scene, was not a scary (or good) movie at all.  The moral:  A scary scene does not necessarily make a scary movie. One last word of advice:  The less you know about this movie, the scarier it will be when you watch it.  If I were you, I wouldn't read anymore user comments or reviews."

They get temporary A.D.D. when there is no score to tell them when to be scared, and when to yell at Drew Barrymore, ""Don't go outside!""

","Whatever you do, do not see this movie alone!  Not because it is scary, but so you will have another perspective.  While my movie partner was screaming in fear, I was screaming let me out of here! I was excited when it started, and ecstatic when it was over.  This rates as one of the most tedious and boring movies I have seen in years. The effect,to me, was more like Formica, than real wood.  It was pretending to be something real, but I was never able to believe it.<br/><br/>Three film students get lost in the woods on a quest for any truth behind local myths of witch evils, and ritual slayings.  You know the ending from the very beginning, so how the story takes us there is the meat of the movie. Events start out fairly enough, introducing the players and effectively sharing their enthusiasm and naivete'. The filming process can be dizzying but is part of the premise.  The first half of the movie lost my attention and was never strong enough to recapture it.  As a result, I never felt their fear, or cared about their plight, but instead my mind wandered during the terror-like scenes to visions of the real film crew skipping happily through the woods gathering bundles of twigs and rocks, while others strung them into funky voodoo ornaments to hang in the trees.  Lapses in logic became more noticeable due to my lost interest and the seriousness of the documentary pretense.  If you find yourself in that position during this movie, you might wonder where they found the super-batteries to power their cameras?..why would someone waste flashlight power to sew in the dark when you might really need it to find the boogie-bitch later...why, if you are scared witless, hallucinating about mashed potatoes, inhumanly fatigued, and eating tree leaves, could you even consider hauling around a 70 pound back pack, much less, remain focused on filming???  While the script's depiction of bickering and likely conversations may have been one of the more accurate aspects of the movie, that too, became annoying due to its excessive reliance on the characters ""f**king"" limited vocabulary.<br/><br/>Many moviegoers will love this effort simply because it is different, not because it is good.  That alone, reflects the sad state of big budget offerings. Hooray for the true indies and I'm happy for this group and their success.  Maybe they can make the movie business better now.<br/><br/>
There certainly seems to be no middle ground for personal or professional passions regarding this movie.  You love it or you hate it.  With that in mind, wait for the discount showing or video.  It will be a bargain love fest, and not much lost for the other scenario (take a flashlight and a knitting project, just in case). But please, if you choose to see this move, bring a friend and plan for lively discussion afterward."

It took a little while to get used to the 16mm camera, and documentary style, but it added to the terror with its natural sound and reality.  Such a simple idea as this must leave big-horror-movie buffs and agencies kicking themselves, because it shows that audiences are truly terrified not by serial killers wielding chainsaws coming through the wall, but by symbols and slight crackling noises that leave chills for days and weeks to come.

","It's too bad that some people are calling this film the scariest movie ever. I didn't find it as scary as it was thought provoking and splendidly done. The film makers succeeded abundantly at making a film that was truly brilliant. It's too bad that Stanley Krubrick died, after ""Eyes Wide Shut"" he could have learned alot about film making from the makers of Blair Witch. The movie is so well done that when it was first shown the film makers had private investigators calling up and saying they wanted to re-open the case and find out what happened to the three film makers. They had to assure them that it was only fiction. I saw two films this weekend, Blair Witch and The Haunting, the former was brilliant, the latter was just another typical Hollywood formula film that depends on specail effects and computers to entertain.

","I had been waiting over a month before finally seeing this master piece. TBWP is by far the creepiest, most frightening film to come out in a real long time. Those that didn't appreciate this truly great film are either lacking in imagination, or too young to remember classic horror films like The Shining. <br/><br/>This film isn't like Scream, which makes you jump a number of times throughout the movie. No, this is much more. The unique camera views make you feel like you are there with them. Rather than use fake looking monsters, the film makers force the audience to use their imagination. Assuming you have one, the worst possible images will invade your mind. The simple sounds are so effective because the feeling of being in the woods at night is freaky alone. <br/><br/>When the film was over, my original reaction was that it lacked some truly frightening effects. However, as my girlfriend and I talked about the film, I continued to relive the experience, each time creating a more terrifying image to go with the experience. I am still reliving the final scene, constantly inventing new ideas about what happened. I now see that this is the scariest movie I've seen, because I can't get it out of my head."

If this is not the most frightening movie I have ever seen, then it's in the top three for sure. The film is scary not in the sense of ""shock"", ie. Jason jumps out from behind a tree and yells ""BOO!"", but scary in that disturbing way, that for the duration of the film, you have this sense of profound dread building up, the kind of terror that children who play in the woods at night and hear a scary sound feel for a brief while. <br/><br/>Sitting in the movie theater, the most honest feeling I had was ""I just want this to END"".

","*SPOILER WARNING*<br/><br/>
Personally, I loved The Blair Witch Project. I had been waiting in anitcipation for it ever since I saw a preview back in April. I was happy to see that I wasn't disappointed. Rather than rely on expensive and cheesy specail effects a'la The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project used the views own imagination to scare you.You NEVER know what is out in those woods making those sounds, which I think is much scarier than an actor in bad make-up. Of course, if you have a poor imagination, this concept is kind of lost on you :) .  I loved the freakish sounds the characters heard at night, as well as the bizarre discoveries during the day. But once Josh disappears, it really picks up. When Heather finds the body part in the bundle of sticks and the final shot......brrrrrrrrrrr......freaky, scary stuff. It was like an old campfire story that was filmed. My one copmplaint was that there was too much day footage and not enough night stuff. I liked watching the slow breakdown of the characters, but I would have much rather have scene more of the creepy night sounds and maybe even a glimpse of a shadowy figure or something. As much as I loved this movie, I can understand why people may hate it. It was INCREDIBLY over-hyped by the Internet and the media. Hype will kill anything good OR bad. As well, the first hour is rather uneventful (but NOT boring). Not to offend anyone, but I believe this is a ""smart person"" horror movie. If you have a good imagination, and a grip on what horror is, and are not expecting special effects you will love The Blair Witch Project. Just sit back, and try and put ypourself in Heather's shoes and I htink you will really enjoy it. But go in with an open mind and expect soemthing totally different. Side note, that one scene with Heather making the apologies was awesome! The terror in her eyes...especially when she heard that sound...the defining moment in the film!<br/><br/>By the way, don't sit in the first few rows. I had to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie because I thought I was going to puke! The jiggly camera effects made me sea sick!"

","The reviews I read were mixed but mostly were in big favor of the BWP. In general the movie was pretty good. The acting was great and the story was good too, including the last ten minutes. I may have enjoyed the movie more if I had been closer to the screen. As with most movies plays etc., you get more out it if you are more focused and are not distracted by your surroundings. You need focus with this movie. It is meant to be a documentary so I had no problem with the shaky camcorder and 16mm footage(apparently the character students were not in senior year). The biggest problem I had with the movie is that if I were scared and fearful of my life the first thing I would do is drop the camera no matter how dedicated I was to my work. Although Heather did admit she was using the camera as a way of dealing with the fear."
"dino-45","Null","1","1","1 August 1999"," The Blair Witch Project can be summed up in one word - HYPE.
","This movie was said by some critics to be the scariest or possibly best movie of all time, but it  was far from the scariest or best.  Although many people who have seen the movie state that they were completed terrified and still shaken by the movie, I was not even a little frightened.  I am not trying to say that I'm tough I just think that perhaps I missed something that everybody else found scary.  Perhaps I have been sucked in by the blood and gore horror's of the 90's but I just don't understand how people can say that they enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Maybe it was just me but by the end of the movie I was pretty sick and tired of all the screaming and arguing going on, especially from Heather Donahue.  Don't get me wrong I think they did a great job selling the supposed reality of the story I just found it annoying. A lot of common sense was also lacking in the film.  Simple things such as following a stream when you get lost, or to stop filming when you are about to lose your mind.  But perhaps Josh said it best when he said that looking through the camera lens takes away from the reality of the situation, or something like that.  Staying awake through the night would also have been a good idea. I think the movie had the right concept of trying to make it look real I just don't think that they did enough to make it scary.  This perhaps could just be my lack of imagination. This movie could also have been destroyed for me because I went in to it with such high expectations.  I have always enjoyed making movies with my friends and when heard that there was going to be an actual film made with a low budget by two film students I became very interested.  If I had watched this movie, knowing nothing about it before hand perhaps my opinion would be different. The majority of the film is the trio getting ready to embark on their journey and hiking through the woods with no problems.  This took up almost an hour of the eighty-some minute long movie.  I thought that the first hour was humorous and I think that overall the film was funnier than it was scary. I heard that the next movie for the two writters is supposed to be a comedy, maybe it will be scarier than it is funny. I would say to someone that hasn't seen it to go because there are obviously people who find it scary so go and see for yourself.  And hey, if you don't find it scary you'll at lest get a few laughs.<br/><br/>But hey, that's just me!"
"Jess-24","Null","1","1","1 August 1999"," the scariest movie ever made.
","i can not believe anyone who gave this one a bad comment.<br/><br/>I hardly ever get scared at movies, but holy hell was i scared here! The haunting story of the death of 3 documentry filmmakers told through the eyes of a camcorder is the most brilliant idea to come along in ages, and it is played out as a non-typical horrer movie. There is only brief gore and one shot of it. the suspense comes from the fear of the dark more than anything else, unlike other horrer movies. Not since The Shining has fear been played out like it could drive you insane.  <br/><br/>The story begins with 3 film students, all determind young people with an obvious knack for the art, and camping. They first destination is Burkittsville, formelly a town called Blair. But Blair has quite a colourful history involving a witch who likes to kill small children in the woods. She would often kill groups of them one by one while making the others stand in a corner. (If you didnt get the ending there you go.) The 3 would-be film students learn storys about it from locals in Burkittsville, which of course dont fase thier plans to film in the woods. Up in the woods their trip is all but cut off when of course they get lost. They turn against each other and themselves and are eventually drove close to insanity trying to get home. Thats all I'll spoil about the plot.<br/><br/>Things I like about the movie: The idea of of mockumentry-horrer. No gore. (Well, a brief scene.) The scenes where they first find the furry stick figure hanging from the tree, and the house. Amazing acting. The best ending ever besides ""The Usual Suspects"" Heathers confession-Powerful stuff. The scene with the two fisherman arguing.<br/><br/>Things I didnt like: Way to much swearing, even for me. Sickness enducing camera. They would never keep the film running when all that was going on. Heather found time to do her hair a new way every morning. I go camping alot and I think this might stop me from continuing. As some commenters already said, they would have taken a guide or a cell phone. Thier footage was way to deep in the woods to be ""dug up.""<br/><br/>

"RedWolf-8","8","1","1","1 August 1999"," A thriller for some, a thinker for others.
","I went to see this film with two other people. Going into it, I expected to be frightened beyond belief, which in hindsight, might have affected my opinion of the film. The general opinion of the film critics and other people who saw the film seemed to be that it was unbelievably thrilling , and gripping, and worthy of comparison too horror classics like The Exorcist. After seeing The Blair Witch Project, I can say that I do not agree with these people. I am not making any attempt to trash this movie as I was generally impressed by it in several ways. First of all, the first person perspective from which the viewer sees the film is very creative and adds a lot to the thrilling aspect of the film by making the viewer feel like they are actually there. Also, the way the characters are portrayed adds to the realistic feel of it. It feels less like acting and more like the natural behavior of three people in a difficult situation. For me, what was on the less appealing side was the lack of closure in many parts of the film. (You will be able to understand this statement after viewing the film.) While this feature also adds to the unique feel of the film by making us realize our own fear of the unknown, it also gives people the option to fill in blanks on their own. The problem with this is that you never know what is really happened. This nagging feeling of uncertainty was enough to turn some people off. I talked to several people after seeing the film, and the general feeling was that it left too much to think about for the viewers. These days, people go to movies to be told a story, whether it be funny, scary, dramatic or whatever, they want the story to be told to them, they don't want to have to create pieces of it themselves. Although it is intellectually stimulating, it is not expected from movies. For this reason, I would say that The Blair Witch Project is more of a psychological thriller than a straight horror movie. If you like thinking about what could have, or what really happened, then this is probably your type of movie, otherwise you might be a little disappointed unless you are very easily scared."

We know what is going to happen; we just don't know when or how. Plus, we watch as three seemingly intelligent people basically fall apart.<br/><br/>The film really kicks in during the final 30 minutes to the dizzying climax and haunting last scene.<br/><br/>A must-see for fans of horror and suspense; also for movie fans who want to see something new and different.

Seeing the footage of the parents putting up missing flyers and talking about the search, including where and how they found the footage, would've made it much more disturbing. I noticed that the people who thought it was real true enjoyed the movie much more, so don't go telling your friends that it is fake. There was some fairly good acting in it, unfortunately, the guy who plays mike isnt the best, and his facade falls through during the scene where he reveals what he did with the map.

This was easily the most shiver-inducing, all-out frightening movie I've ever seen. There are no jump-out-of-your-seat scares, no shots of a slimy, ugly alien or any other cheap scare tactics: all that exists while this film runs is FEAR, nauseating, jaw-clenching, stoop-down-in-your-seat fear. I went in to the theater afraid that the film had been overhyped, that I wouldn't like it as much as I hoped I would, and, after about 20 minutes or a half hour, I thought that my worries were coming true. Then I realized that I was hoping, really hoping, that the scene wouldn't shift to night again. That's when I realized just how afraid I really was. The big reason that this film is so frightening is it's realism. In most movies you have to make an attempt to identify with the characters; in TBWP you have no choice. You become basically the fourth person,  and that prospect is what is truly scary: ""What if that was me up there?"" I shudder to think about it even now. I'm not even going to get started on the last 5-10 minutes of the film; I'll just leave it at the fact that I have never been as scared in a theater as I was at TBWP's conclusion. And I slept with the light on afterward. This is a brilliant, brilliant film."

","After all of the hype (One newscaster said, ""the last 15 minutes is the most scary piece of film I've ever seen""), Blair Witch left me kinda flat.  Sure, it was VERY creative, it had a good story and was also kind of funny.  BUT, it was not scary.  It didn't have shock value, like any other horror movie. I was also slightly disappointed when we didn't even get to see at least a shadow of what was terrorizing the three documentarians the whole time. But, if you go in NOT expecting the scariest movie of all time, you might be a little creeped out.  But I was expecting the scariest movie of all time, and I came out wanting another teeny-bopper slash film.  Still a good movie to see.  It's entertaining to watch the spirits of our heroes decompose in front of our eyes!"

I rated it a 9 on the voting.<br/><br/>But if you're not careful and open-minded, you might not pick up on just how great this effort is.<br/><br/>The film has none of the Hollywood action cues, setups, or prompts that we're condidioned to respond to.  The lazy viewer, thus unprompted, will miss out on the import of the action.  There is no music to cue dramatic scenes. No sound effects to enforce the action. No sight or sound of the witch.<br/><br/>In keeping with the premise of the movie, the opening screens are unadorned and silent.

Even though it's short, some of my fellow theater-goers were bored after an hour and laughed at times when the tension should have been getting thicker.

","I enjoyed the film as a whole and definitely felt the pull of despair that slowly swelled up out of the actors as time went on. This film had the uncanny knack of being able to keep you emotionally paced with the events at hand. Nothing particularly jumped out and scared me during it, but I was definitely feeling the uneasiness of the characters situation and that uneasiness rose with the characters as the film progressed. I don't think that this film corrects what has been going wrong with horror films over the last 20 years (i.e.: too many FX, not letting the audience imagine anything) but it is a good step in the right direction. The actors are uncanny in how believable they are and how they react to what is a formidable situation. Lost, inexperienced, hungry, in the throes of a nicotine fit and unaware of how each person in the group reacts to stress and the unknown or unseen. This film could be used to illuminate how humans deal with the unknown and fear. The fear, like I said, doesn't jump out and bite you....it simply puts you in its mouth and slowly swirls you around. Next thing you know you are nearly a participant, and you really don't want to be. Good film...hope this isn't a flash in the pan for these guys. Wake up Hollywood. We want you to use this as a horror platform from which to launch new horror from. BTW, don't sit too close to the screen...especially if you get motion sickness easy."
"ltamburello","Null","1","1","1 August 1999"," The Scary Movie That Wasn't.
","Perhaps my expectations were too high.  Perhaps the anticipation was too attenuated.  Perhaps someone switched reels in the projector room before the movie started.  The main problem with the film, IMHO, is that the characters are just plain dumb.  They realize, albeit too late, that it's time to forsake their film project and haul ass out of the woods.  Like the characters, the audience is presented only with circumstantial evidence of supernatural events.  I guess this was supposed to heighten the tension, but instead with each passing ""occurrence"" the characters simply plod ahead with their little film, making them pathetic figures.  For example, if one of your three-person crew suddenly disappeared without rhyme or reason one morning, would you think that he would signal his return by making muffled grunts in the pitch black dead of night?  Would you then call his name and turn on a bright camera light so whatever's out there could more easily find you?  Please.<br/><br/>Although Heather has a touch of Ahab-like singlemindedness, the other two are stock characters who are content to follow her search for the white whale.. er, witch.  <br/><br/>Wait for home video, crank up the 5.1 surround and turn off the nights.

","WOW!!! Great movie.  Personally I did not find myself scared because I knew it was a movie but when we left the theatre last night their were about 10 traumatized girls their that could not even open their eyes to look at the credits so scared something else was going to happen.  What makes this movie so good is that you do not have to see a skinny old one with a long nose to actually feel fear, the directors relied on letting your imagination create what the scary sounds were, unlike in the new ""the haunting"" were you saw all the scary things.  The actors were great; they actual had emotions toward what was happening.  <br/><br/>If you go and see this movie you can go in two ways in as viewing it.  One this is just movie, there is never really anything out there that is going to hurt them and you know that this people are actual still alive at this very moment.  Your result is a good movie that is quite interesting and intriguing.  Viewing two going in thinking that this was real people put yourself in their place, believing that thing was happening to you and you end up with a movie that will probably scare the $#!^ out of you. <br/><br/>
Closing analysis great movie worth the wait in live and worth the money.  If you know that it is just a movie then it is not that scary if you can always keep that grip on reality then you are probably going to walk out crying clinging to a friends arm and stay up half the night wondering what that sound was coming from in the living room.<br/><br/>NeO raGe"

","I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" in Memphis yesterday, and let me tell you, you have to see this!! It is one of the creepiest movies ever made. The final 30 seconds of the movie is the best part, and it is one of the best endings I have ever seen in a movie, and definitely the best in a horror movie. The final scene is so creepy, it makes me scared just thinking about it. It's a totally original movie (well, almost). The atmosphere of the movie reminds me of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which, by the way, is my favorite horror movie. The movie has a lot of profanity in it, but it is worth watching again just to see the ending again. To fully understand the ending, you have to understand the stories at the beginning. I was actually scared last night before I went to bed, and it's been a long time since I was that scared after a movie.<br/><br/>I went into this movie thinking it was a true story, and I think this is the best way to approach the movie. I had a unique, unsettling experience unlike any I've had in watching a movie before. A warning: this movie will not work for you unless you use a lot of imagination during and after the movie.<br/><br/>
After the movie, you are not likely to say, ""Wow, that was a really scary movie."" It is in the hours that follow after the movie when you think about the ending and the rest of the movie when the horror really sets in. This is no ""Scream"", ""Halloween"", or ""Friday the 13th."" It is a refreshing turn for the better for the horror genre after a recent raft of hip teen horror flicks like ""Scream"", ""I Know What you did"", and ""Carrie 2"".<br/><br/>

","The Blair Witch Project creates a unique blend of the terrifying with the unknown.  The audience is enticed to become part of the film-maker's world, to laugh along with the characters, to wonder what led to this, and almost to run in pure horror of the thing hunting them down. <br/><br/>It is obvious as the film progresses that the 3 are losing their heads, their very personalities working against them, their egos and self-pride dissolving as hopelessness sets in, their mind becoming that of an alone and fearful animal.  They forget about their tedious social lives, instead the only thing that matters is finding their way out of a world they no longer have control of.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch project is not about the Blair Witch.  It is about what can happen when humans are no longer the dominating force, and consequently what happens to the person's mind that is subjected to this horror.  All of this build-up leads to an ending that not only is absolutely terrifying, but also leaves a huge mystery, a void that only the viewer can fill."

A camera is more likely to be used to smack something rather than try to film it, even when faced with a raccoon, never mind a homicidal spirit from beyond the grave. At first I thought it was just me, but as I glanced around the packed theater when the lights came up, my gaze was met by looks of confusion and disappointment all the way around.

","_The Blair Witch Project_ is, indeed, a very frightening movie; more interestingly, it's a pretty successful experimental film, of a sort I can't recall having seen before. The directors performed an experiment in ""method film-making"" here, taking three actors, giving them cameras and basic instructions in their use, set them loose in the woods and (evidently) spent some time scaring the blue daylights out of them while they played with the cameras. The results are very effective, not least owing to the film's complete obstinacy in refusing to explain what it is you're seeing.  This film is possibly better enjoyed if you've seen the ""teaser"" segment on the Sci-Fi channel: it provides some useful context in which to place the actual film."

There are no special effects or over-made monsters as the antithesis in the film.  The location could be Anywhere, USA and the cast made you believe what was happening.  All and all, you could almost believe that you were watching something that actually happened.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ALMOST is the key word.  The problem with the movie as a ""horror"" film is that you cannot suspend belief enough to really get scared. That is true in a sense of all horror films, but others have something PHYSICAL (like Michael Myers) that haunts you, even if you know it is not real.  Blair Witch Project delivers as a thriller that makes you wonder what will happen as the movie progresses, but leaves you ultimately unfulfilled. It HAD to end the way it did, you just wish it didnt.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is worth seeing for the concept and as a good thriller... you may even get terrified if you can suspend your belief more than I.

","""The Blair Witch Project"" ""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called 'The Blair Witch Project'. A year later their footage was found."" That's the premise the filmmakers give the audience for this recent Sundance Film Festival rave.  You can think of this film as a horror ""This Is Spinal Tap"", - completely fictional, but filmed in a way that suggests that what you are seeing really happened. Shot with a digital video camera and 16mm film, we watch as three young filmmakers get lost in the woods and bicker like a married couple from hell. I give first time directors Daniel Myrick and Edward Sanchez a ton of credit and respect for this creepy feature.  They create and execute the most searing horror film in some time. It's a truly original creation.  With more and more films itching toward the excess and pomp of the visual terror, ""Blair Witch"" is purely psychological. We only see bits and pieces of what is terrorizing the trio and that is enough.  Any more would kill the illusion and ruin the suspense.  Trouble is, cut to 82 minutes from a 150 minute cut (even longer at one point), the movie oozes choppiness.  Jumping from moment to moment sours the spooky mood.  More scenes should have been left to linger. Instead, the film cuts around aimlessly.  When the picture truly hits a nerve - in the final 5 minutes - it makes the 77 that proceeded it seem pretty wasteful. Most of the film consists of watching the trio yell and agitate each other. Only a small amount of attention is played to the Blair Witch of the title. While being lost in endless woods with nothing to eat and no way of getting home is a pretty damn scary concept in itself, the film keeps reintroducing the supernatural element only to dismiss it for yet another puerile fight.  If this was truly a real incident, I would bet the farm that any news outlet who got their hands on this footage would squeeze the Blair Witch teat till it ran dry.  When the ending arrives, it only reminds you of the gaps in the storytelling that should have been fixed. Actors Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams do a sharp job as the cameraman and soundman of the group.  They successfully convey fear and anger, and they convincingly look like hell.  It's actress Heather Donahue that bothered me. Out of all three actors, Donahue feels the most false.  She's just too cinematic in her acting, often resorting to melodrama when the film begs the opposite.  This is a situation which invites a million different questions.  A perfectly acted film can make you forget the seams. Donahue's acting keeps you reminded that this is a fabricated film. While I did like ""Blair Witch"", I fail to see what all the fuss is about. It's a wobbly horror flick that will spawn countless imitators upon release. It's a primitive film that reintroduces genuine scares to a genre that long ago forgot how to terrorize. It's a easily buzzable film that the cinematic community loves to hype because everybody feels that they discovered it.  It's a lot of things except the one thing that counts the most...  It isn't great. --------------- 7"

","I went to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" with 2 of my friends on opening day at my local theater(7/30/99), and to be honest, I  did not find it to be that scary...In fact we spent a good majority of the movie laughing at the film. I think the reason I found it to be so boring was that I had heard film critics rave about how scary it was, and probably expected too much from it. I can see how you could be scared if you really got into the movie and put yourself in their place, but I just had a hard time doing so. The only time I screamed during the whole movie, in fact, was when the lights came back on and I realized I had just wasted ten bucks. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that at times it succeeds at being spooky(The 3 piles of rocks by the tent, for those of you who have seen it), but due to the fact that you find out at the opening scene that the characters are already dead, it really kills any suspense the film could offer. I really enjoyed the fact that the movie was recorded using home video cameras and DATs(It made it all too  believable and realistic). So, I guess all I can say for ""The Blair Witch Project"" is that as a film I found it original and realistic, but for a horror movie there was little/no suspense(which in my opinion makes a scary flick)."

","There was alot of hype about this movie within the last few weeks, and it probably weakened the movies impact.<br/><br/>Regardless, the filmmakers went back to what really frights you, rather than CGI style which tends to be the trend these days. Rather than showering a movie with played out graphical special effects or simple things jumping out and queued music to scare you, they go straight to what counts. The movie uses a more psychological way to frighten you, it puts you in the place of the charectors and lets you think for yourself. The movie does not spoil itself and take part in the trendy slashing-blood-everywhere films that are around today. Although lots of suburbanite kids will be saddened at the absence of massive gore and that it's not a large hollywood spectacle with a giant 20 track soundtrack, MTV special and some jennifer love hewitt charector. This movie sticks to the basics, while the ending might anger some, it sure leaves alot to wonder about in your head. I'm sure some people will walk away thinking of the ending, and what happened... Rather than eye-candy, this movie is true substance."

","My friend and I saw The Blair Witch Project the night it opened. I admit that I'm a wuss and could barely WATCH the last 10 minutes of the movie, but my friend wants a sequel. There's nothing ""new"" to the movie that can't be found on the website, with perhaps the slight exception of a certain discovery in the woods.<br/><br/>There has to be a sequel -- this is only half of the movie. It doesn't answer any questions, it only raises them.

It makes people motion sick, and had I had the courage to watch during the scary bits, I might have been among those who got ill.

","Well, this is perhaps the most original presentation of a horror/suspense movie that has been brought to market in as long as I can remember.  I find only two flaws with the film:<br/><br/>1) To make the film have more of an impact, the filmmakers should not have revealed that it is not a true documentary, at least not until the movie had made an impact.  The knowlege that there is actually nothing out there but a bunch of filmmakers making noise in the forest detracts from the ""feeling"" of the movie.  I wanted to believe, and in a few scenes I did actually have goosebumps, but always in the back of my mind was the knowlege that it was all fake.  The goosebumps were generated by the true emotion shown by the actors/actress on the screen.  Their ""performances"" were great.<br/><br/>2) There needed to be more ""explanation"" of the events.  While the ""raw tape"" shown was gritty and provided the ""feel"" needed to pull off the movie, I think that without a set-up there is definitely something missing.  The two or three brief statements at the beginning of the film (the same statements that appear in the commercials and trailers) give the viewer a basic understanding of what they are about to see, but that's just it, a basic understanding.  I walked into the theatre with almost four months of knowlege of the ""story"" under my belt and I enjoyed the movie more than my companion who had heard very little.  If you haven't been reading the updates on the website and watching the special on Sci-Fi, you missed a great portion of the whole mystery and feeling that is the Blair Witch.  A bit of an intro would have been appropriate, in my opinion.<br/><br/>In all, I enjoyed the movie.  I recommend it.  Don't expect Hollywood at all when you walk into the theatre...but expect to get some chills."

","I saw this movie the week before the nation wide release.  With the SciFi Channel and the www.blairwitch.com giving the background to the Blair Witch, it is easy to mistake this move as non-fiction.  Even after I knew it was fictional, I was still enthralled with the movie.  I left it forgetting that it was fake.<br/><br/>The shaking of the camera is not that bad, kind of like hearing traffic outside the door...you tend to phase it out.  There are times, however, that I got a smirk at something that was supposed to be scary....AND there are times that something trivial scares the heebie jeebies out of me.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend viewing the www.blairwitch.com or the SciFi special before watching the movie.

"syaofsjc","Null","1","1","31 July 1999"," Don't let the hype ruin it for you!
","I saw this movie the night it opened nationwide, after weeks of the biggest hype since the second Austin Powers movie.  When the lights went up, I saw people all around me scoff at the so-called ""scariest movie ever made"" and even my companion said it was a ""let down."" Which is unfortunate, because ""the hype"" is forcing comparisons that shouldn't be made and turning attention away from the true brilliance of this film.<br/><br/>I am annoyed with reviewers who compare this movie to The Exorcist or The Shining.  You simply cannot compare movies with huge Hollywood budgets with a movie made with two cameras and next to zero budget.  Don't fall into that trap.  This is not like any movie you have ever seen and that's what impressed those who saw it before the hype and drove them to create the hype.<br/><br/>This movie separates those with imagination from those who do not.  If you are someone who scares yourself by thinking about horror films after you have walked out of the theater, than this  movie will creep you out for days to come.  The filmmakers didn't have the money for special effects and they resist the urge to give in to standard horror movie cliches.  This movie presents a terrifying scenario and asks its audience to take the terror to the next level.  How far are you willing to let your imagination take you? If you are not sure, you will know after you see this movie by your reaction to it.  If you need special effects, blood and gore or things popping up on the screen to make you jump in order to enjoy a scary movie, this film is not for you.  But if you can put yourself out in the woods, lost, with people you don't know very well, hungry, scared and tormented by something you can't see (but can hear), then you will find this movie full of creepy thoughts and images that give your mind just enough to torment you with a sleepless night or two.<br/><br/>Also, I highly recommend the website (blairwitch.com).  It provides cool background info and interviews not seen in the movie.  And, if you are like me, you'll probably start freaking yourself out before you even see the movie.<br/><br/>When you think about what the filmmakers had to work with and what they created, you will be astounded and impressed by this film.  Since it is impossible to avoid the hype, try not to let it manipulate you into expecting something this film was never meant to be.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  creepy, suspenseful and full of ammunition for a fertile imagination!

I think the best thing about this whole movie was the charachter development.  You really care about what happens to them. As you watch Heather,Josh and Mike go from vibraint,energetic teens to starved,lonley,terrfied and curious victims, you feel for them and their families. As a true horror movie buff, I totally appreciate and respect this movie.  It seemed like everyone came out of the theather with different reviews.  One guy a few rows back threw up ... I am not sure if it was from the movie or the stale popcorn.

"Devndemn","Null","1","1","31 July 1999"," ""Blair Witch"" Revives Faith in Originality and Terror in Horror Films
","Sick of the recent wave tepid and trite horror to come from Hollywood, I am delighted to report that this film revives not only the genre itself...but filmmaking as a whole.  This ""mockumentary"" follows three film students into the Maryland woods in search of the mythical Blair Witch.  They disappear...and the footage found four months later details what terrifying occurences befell them.  While knowing the film if ficticious, the viewer is still left with a feeling of uneasiness watching the slow and painful mental and physical breakdown of the central characters.  The tears and sheer fright portrayed on screen by the actors, however, is real.  With this in mind, certain scenes carry more impact and leave the viewer both frightened and quesy.  The scene in which Heather apologizes to the families of her friends (and her own family) while crying is especially moving...she then closes with the line:  ""I'm scared to close my eyes and I'm scared to open my eyes.""  A few words summarizing her fear and anguish to emotional climax.<br/><br/>This film plays on the old ""things that go bump in the night"" scenario and puts it into a perspective where every sound heard becomes relentlessly horrifying.  Every little thing that goes wrong becomes seemingly bigger and more engulfing.  Here, the characters' panic becomes increasingly more profound and their fear paramount.  By the end of the movie, they lapse into a state of total shock as things become more and more harrowing...and the final scenes show a blood-curdling glimpse of pure terror in the wake of an unbelievable nightmare.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" works on so many levels, and is by far the most orginal film to come along in many years.  With no need for the Hollywood image of mainstream horror, it sets itself apart on the sole purpose of a horror film:  the scare the audience. In this film, you will not find the typical, boring cliches of the slasher film...nor the trappings of FX-laden frighfares...no ""Buffy"", ""Party of Five"" bad actors/actresses...no ""hip"" teen music or look.  What you will find is a well-made, well-conceived, and well-produced picture with exellnt casting and a feel that will linger with the viewer forever.  This film challenges the viewer to use the imagination...and to think of the deep, dark horrors of our own minds in the darkness."

You actaully find yourself getting wrapped up in what these characters are going through. This movie does what every good movie should do, it entertains thoroughly and leaves the viewer wanting more. Not to mention it will scare the pants off of you! This is something most Hollywood movies don't have a clue how to accomplish.

"sally-28","Null","1","1","31 July 1999"," Very eerie, disturbing, bound to give u lots of sleepless nights!
","This movie came as a surprise for me.. my boyfriend and i wanted to see a movie and i happen to come across this movie while searching the internet on upcoming releases.  I read alot of horror stories like Stephen King and Anne Rice, which are full of vampires and stories of the supernatural.  I am a huge fan of thrillers and action-adventure movies, so obviously the Blair Witch Project caught my attention immediately upon hearing some comments and reviews on it.  That was all the info i had coming into the movie and the day after seeing the reviews we were looking forward to seeing it, but just expecting it to be a typical TRYING-to-scare-you movie like Halloween H2O. Well as it turns out i was totally shocked on how emotionally involved i was throughout the movie.  The last 10 minutes just happened so quickly and ended so abruptly, i don't think i had time to digest it all until after the movie when i really had time to absorb everything.  The more i thought of what happened to those three students, the more scary and eerie it made me feel.  It seemed so real, and i could see myself in their situation.  I probably wouldn't have been so brave to have survive some many days. <br/><br/>Even though i enjoy watching movies, i get scaried very easily and tend to get too emotionally involved in them.  I guess my problem is i keep over in my head all of the scenes which makes it more and more scary. <br/><br/>

After having seen the trailer, I've been facinated by the movie and after having red a few things about it on the net, I was convinced that it would be the first movie ever to scare me up and the fitst horror movie to disturb me. Well, not at all. I don't think I've been scare more than ten seconds at all in the movie. But it's still a really great movie. I've been impressed by the cast performance, I felt the tension rising and I've loved all the dialogues, especially from Heather, witch provided pretty funny moments. However, I do get why people vomited in several teathers. It's not because of the emotional charge but because of the hand camera effets, always moving one side to the other, enought to give everybody who gets disturb in a simulator a nausea. Maybe that's what broke my trill. I was actually hoping the movie ends fast. I had to close my eyes every minutes for 10 seconds to make the nausea pass. Maybe it will be the first movie actually more trilling to watch on video."

"MJ1852","Null","1","1","31 July 1999"," Scariest movie ever!!!
","Yes, this was definitely the most terrifying film I have ever seen. I had not even heard of it until my friends asked me to go last night (it was just released this weekend where I live). But now it's hard to stop thinking about it. The idea was brilliant and very original, and I love the fact that they could be so successful with such a low-budget film. I think that slasher movies like Halloween and Scream are scary, but they're different because you KNOW what it is you're afraid of. You sit on the edge of your seat while you wait for Michael Myers or some other guy in a mask w/ a knife to jump out of a dark shadow . . . but in BWP you just hear eerie noises and the thought that the three students can't find their way out of the woods, can't make their way to safety, creeps you out more than the slasher movies. The suspense, the anticipation of the unknown is the terrifying part about this movie. Although the jerkiness of the cameras gave me a little motion sickness, that was effective as well because it seemed more like you were really there than just watching a movie in a theater. I didn't know while I was watching it if it was real or not, but it didn't matter; it was scary either way. I felt for the characters: felt hopelessness, sympathy, terror, and even sadness for the way they were losing their minds and scared out of their wits. I'll admit that I was glad to find out it WASN'T real, but the movie was a real work of art. 10/10.<br/><br/>I'd also like to say, for anyone who implies that whoever thinks this movie is scary is stupid, you are being very closed-minded. It's okay to have your opinions, to say YOU weren't scared and you didn't like the idea for BWP, but obviously a lot of people WERE scared and DID think it was a good idea, so let others have their opinions too w/o bashing them."
"Solid_Snake_m80","9","1","1","31 July 1999"," The thriller all others must base themselves on.
","Let me start by saying, wow. I saw this movie in a theater filled with the most diverse group of people I've seen in a theater since Titanic. Punk teens intermixed with aged film afficionados. The first 40 minutes of the film seem more like a comedy than a thriller, with the three students travelling to Burkettsville, and getting information from townsfolk. Then they head into the woods. If you read the film summary I wrote, Now youre thinking, ""When does it get so scary?"" The genius thing about the film is that, like all of the best, waits until the last 20 minutes of the movie to reveal itself as a thriller. The suspence in this movie is killer. Take off your watch before you enter, or you will find yourself looking at it to see how many minutes are left, and that would truly ruin it. The film, Strangely enough, never drops from it's climax, once it reaches it. You find yourself pitying the students as the last shreds of humanity are torn away into an almost animal wish to escape the forest. This film doesn't explain itself, which will turn off Kevin Williamson fans, who want the happy ending, where all is resolved. You will question what happened in the end for days, before realizing that some things are better left unknown."

","Since there was no ""hype""in France and I don't listen to critics anyway, I saw this movie with no preconceptions other than the trailer.

Instead of being innovative, it gave me the feeling of going back to the roots of horror with stories, not by Lovecraft, but Algernon Blackwood (""The Wendigo"") or Arthur Machen, who could convey this sense of unseen terror and dangerous landscapes. The idea seemed reminescent of the ""dogma"" movies and a series of mock-documentaries made by the French/German TV channel Arte, all showing false documentaries about abnormal events presented as the real thing - but giving the trick in the end to question the viewer's gullibility. (But the filmmakers of BWP can't have seen it, of course.) And the movie ? I thought the end was a bit of a let-down, but as a suspense story, it was quite gripping. Why all the hype ? Maybe because low-budget ground-breaking horror is an established tradition since NOTLD and there was nothing else around ?(Like ""Henry"", very overrated in my opinion.) Why did  the media jumped on it ? Maybe the devil made them do it, or i"

"pat-89","Null","1","1","30 July 1999"," The most original, inventive, & gripping film in ages
","Who ever thought you could make a movie like this and it would have turned out so well. I mean taking three unknown actors into the woods with shaky, handheld cameras and having them improvise most all the dialogue in a film that has an unseen villain and is almost completely absent of violence and gore. And somehow it is the scariest thing you will see for years to come.<br/><br/>
Stellar horror films are few and far between. The only great ones in the last ten years were ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". But now ""The Blair Witch Project"" should be added to the list of horror classics, somewhere near the top. It does for camping what ""Psycho"" did for showering and ""Jaws"" did for swimming in the ocean.<br/><br/>As the three filmmakers get lost in the woods it becomes increasingly more evident with each passing night that someone or something is following them and has not taken a liking to their presence. The events that take place each night gradually become more and more drastic, making every evening more tense and frightening than the last. It continues to build until it reaches an ending of unbelievable intensity, and a final image that is as disturbing as it is perplexing. <br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it's seen entirely through the eyes of the victims. That is what makes it so damn scary. The fact that unknown actors were used also definitely makes it so much more real. When they use improvisation for dialogue they seem like normal people, and you can feel the anger, paranoia, and fear as it radiates off of them. They're great.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is a film that continues to haunt you long after the end credits have rolled. It stays with you. At night you may hear noises comparable to those in the movie. Just your imagination, right? This film is incredible. I loved it. Kudos to Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. You guys are geniuses!"

It's simply a shame that I was alienated from each character due to the fact that they're just plain jerks. By the time the ""shocking ending"" came about, I didn't really care if they died. (Which, everyone knows, they do.) I just wanted them to shut up. <br/><br/>I'm also a great advocate of oblique ways of portraying the antagonist.

"Harvestr","Null","1","1","29 July 1999"," A remarkably well done film
","Let me say one thing before I begin.. this was an remarkably well done film.  Its reliance on acting skills and inventive story telling rather than the sordid showmanship of today's so called ""blockbusters"" was a refreshing reminder that the moviemakers of today still have a soul.<br/><br/>The Good Points: The acting was exceptional on all levels.  Completely engaging and believable, you must keep reminding yourself that this is just' a movie.  The production method was, in such few words, ingenious.  The use of a non-fixed script method and the filming with standard camcorder equipment led to a more believable atmosphere and gave the film a realistic feeling'.  It's ability to use your own imagination to create fear from something they do not even show you was simply amazing.  It is a true thinking' movie.<br/><br/>The Bad Points: While I have few complaints about this movie, I can not conclude that it did not have its share of problems.  I did find the pace of the movie slow at parts, with scenes seeming to repeat their general point over and over.  The level of annoyance was a bit high at times, as the characters argued about camera usage for seemingly endless amounts of time. While this was credited by many as the `scariest movie of all time', I personally did not find that to be true at all. <br/><br/>
Thus the frightening' effect was lessened.  I found it hard to believe that someone would find themselves wanting to film under the circumstances presented in the story.  The amount of humor in this movie far outweighed the actual sense of fear that it induced in me.  But this is just my opinion. I noticed the level of pensive fear in most of the people around me during the movie, so be assured that not all feel this way.<br/><br/>Even with all of the bad points I have stated, the seemingly small amount of good points presented far outweighs them. Overall, the film was excellent.  It is far from becoming one of my favorite' movies of all time, but I am sure other will definitely feel much more strongly about it.  Go see it! You will no regret that you did. or will you?"

","For all that have been disappointed by horror films as of late should definitely see The Blair Witch Project. As we are seeing the events unfold in the first person, as well as seeing them through Hi8 video/16MM film, the realism is increased. Not to mention that at times, the actors actually show their descent into madness with each passing day. The more strange occurrences happen, the more the actors look like they are loosing their grip on reality. This translates perfectly into the audience's perceptions, and a hushed pandemonium grips the viewers. When I saw the New York advanced screening, everyone left the theater white faced and totally drained from the culmination of the picture. I don't want to give out too much about the plot, but the tag line says it all, and the ending will be the most horrific ending that anyone has exposed on film. If you let this movie into your head, you will not be right after viewing it. Just remember; it's just a movie."

","This is it, the movie that dethroned ""Scream"", which is an amazing accomplishment.  There's a problem built into the horror genre, what's terrifying, over time, becomes commonplace and then tepid.  I don't think people who see films like ""Psycho"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", etc., today are getting the same experience their parents and sometimes grandparents got the first time, audiences have become too media savvy, they know all of the rules.  ""Scream"" didn't break those rules, it made fun of them, it was entertaining but not that scary.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch Project"" is based on two premises which give the film it's power.  First, it's almost impossible to create a special effect today which an audience will buy as real, they might appreciate an effect but they won't believe in it, they've seen too much fake stuff.  ""Blair Witch"" gets around that problem by keeping it all off screen.  And second, if you want your audience to feel an emotion populate your film with self-indulgent drama queens.  I laugh at those who ever thought this film could be real but it's great entertainment.<br/><br/>For my money the scariest film of the past several years is still ""Saving Private Ryan"", the initial invasion scenes and the ones where Melish fights hand to hand to his death.  Terrifying and very well done.  ""Blair Witch"" is the second scariest but is much more in keeping with current definitions of ""hipness""."

","Sunday, July 25, 1999<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project - 30 minutes after seeing it! By, BillStoll@aol.com<br/><br/>Alright I saw it.  I had to cross the country to Los Angeles. to find a theater showing it.  But I did it. You need to too.<br/><br/>There are a hundred summaries of the film's plot on www.imdb.com, so I'll mercifully avoid restating it. My reaction to all the hype follows instead. Here at a Santa Monica, 800 seat  theater near L.A., the show was sold out ""seven shows"" in advance.  We wound up going to Sunday night's 9:50 PM showing (that's about 1 PM, east coast).  And it was worth the wait and navigating through the packed (large!) theater's audience.  Which I hate to do, generally speaking.<br/><br/>A comment first about movie's quality.  The home movie (shaky camera; crappy images) thing got on my nerves eventually, as I thought it might . . . until the last ten minutes or so, when the movie pays off.  Trust someone who has seen a lot of horrr films in his day: You will be freaked out by its closing minutes.  Oh yeah.   . . . it paints the face of fear like you've never seen it before, then goes on to chronicle it, bringing you along for the ride as it wraps up the story in a neat little package.<br/><br/>Great essays open and close to the same central thesis.  Listen closely to the opening small town dialog (about the Blair Witch legends) from the Burkittsville MD residents.  In particular, to Mary Brown, one of the creepier castings the creators of this film arranged.  It is a clean story, from back to front. Stories like that are what movies should be all about.<br/><br/>There are a hundred things to pick apart regarding the film's manufacture, particularly if you're a fussbudget viewer like myself ( . . . did I actually write that about moi?!).  But therein lies the genius of the home movie / college-student approach.  You forgive the flaws because the participants and their amateur process (in their fear) surely could have taken the tack portrayed.  Anyone reading this ever truly get ""lost in the woods?""  I have (35 years ago albeit) and it is scary.  Damned scary!  So: to the major criticism assigned by the internet reviewers about it being unrealistic for anyone - under those conditions - to continue filming, my take was that they needed to do ""something"" to preserve their sanity in their hopelessness and terror.  The alternative: to give up, wither and die frightened and unproductive in the woods.  The prospective flaws (I saw) were the absence of a cell phone or a search party perhaps.  However, even as I write this now (late, after getting back to my hotel,) my own cell phone is miles away in my daughter's car trunk, forgotten by yours truly. So anything's possible.<br/><br/>Do I recommend it?  (Fargo Voice) Oh, you betcha Margie!  It is only 80 minutes or so long; you get a kick out of it at first . . . well, up until those last ten big ones.  And those, my friends, are - all by themselves - worth the trip.<br/><br/>Don't worry about sleeplessness after seeing it.  Unless you're prone to camping, hiking or living near the woods now or anytime in the future.<br/><br/>See it when it comes to a theater near you.<br/><br/>BillStoll@aol.com"

","Inspired by the ""real TV"" shows of the past several years, this film attempts to catch the reality of watching a horror movie through the eyes of the victims as captured on their own 8mm and 16mm cameras - and almost succeeds perfectly!<br/><br/>With few exceptions, most horror movies enter into the world of fantasy and extreme gore, making it hard to suspend disbelief.  Consequently, modern horror has generally relied more on shocking with gore and violence (which can be scary if it's done right, it's just rarely done right).  There were old scary movies that drew you into the film and made you lose your sense of self for two hours as you lived through the unknown horrors with the characters (""Rear Window"" comes to mind).<br/><br/>But never have I seen a horror movie that seems so thoroughly realistic and believable that for days afterward I had to consciously remind myself that it wasn't real footage I saw.  ""Blair Witch Project"" did exactly that.  The only weak part of the film is some of the supporting cast, the ""interviewees"" near the beginning, a couple of whom gave sub-par acting performances, but once you're left with just our three main characters -- look out -- you're in for the most realistic excursion into the world of horror ever placed on film.<br/><br/>The acting from the leads, especially Heather Donahue, is first rate.  In fact, she is far more gifted at her craft than any other young actress I've seen in years.  So much about this film outshines what Hollywood can make with a budget 1,000 times as large it makes me wonder why our friends in California still bother to try.  On second thought, maybe they don't anymore."

","Despite what some people say, slasher movies can deliver quite a jolt.  It always gives a slight pulse-quickening when Jason drives a machete into his first victim.  But for that extended grab-the-armrest-until-your-knuckles-turn-white fear, only three different themes do that for me: religious-based horror, clowns (don't ask), and dread, the feeling that things aren't right and the cause of it is just out of reach, but coming closer.  All the best frighteners did it, from the two notes on the cello to denote the appearance of Jaws, to the silhouette of Ma Bates stalking up the stairs, to the wry grin of Vincent Price, to HAL telling his superior that he ""can't do that, Dave"".  The latest addition to this is The Blair Witch Project, which does it so well that almost half the audience I saw it with had difficulty breathing.<br/><br/>The movie is shown as a documentary showing three film students, Heather, Josh, and Mike, preparing a documentary on a local legend known as the Blair Witch.  They film their documentary, but also videotape their experiences, too.  After interviewing a few locals, they learn, with the audience, that there was a disappearance of some children back in the 1940s in the woods surrounding the town, and that people have mysteriously dying all the way back for 300 years.  They then go out into the woods to film some scenes at different sites of the killings, and during this time, they describe the design of twigs that would accompany the killings.  Starting on the second day, they realize that they are lost and when they camp down for the night, they begin to hear voices and disturbances, and when they wake the next morning, they find three rock formations outside their tent.  Josh and Mike begin to blame Heather for getting them lost, since she was the one who put the whole thing together, and never bothered to scout the area first.  After the third night, they change from being a little worried to completely terrified.  They frantically try to backtrack out of the woods, until they realize how lost they are....<br/><br/>First of all, I have to give kudos to the plot.  Documentaries in documentaries have been done before, but it works very well here, as they are still taping themselves in hope that if they don't make it out alive, at least their film will.  The premise of a local legend as the backdrop serves as an overarching fear.  Many areas have that urban or backwoods legend like the Jersey Devil, and this will remind anyone who has ever went into the woods as a youth and tried to find the truth in the rumors.  The whole trick is, you never actually see it, you just see what possibly is the outcome. The use of a simple black & white camera and a camcorder only heightens the worry, with the lower technology reinforcing the idea of just regular people.  There is a scene near the end when Heather holds the camera up to her face and apologizes to Mike's, Josh's, and her parents as she is so overcome by terror she can't speak without crying hysterically and running her nose.  The three of them show real fear as they face their own doom, and you can't help but feel slightly voyeuristic watching this.<br/><br/>The main question of movie is if this is real or not, so if this is pressing you, stick around for the end of the credits.  This movie draws on the most primal fears we all have: the unknown, the things you can't explain, and the things that go bump in the night.  Not seeing what is happening is what creates that feeling of dread.  It's the watching of things unfolding and the anticipation that delivers the fear, i.e. the hunt being much more visceral than the actual kill.  This delivers one hell of a scare and considering the lack of true horror movies of this decade, I would rank this up there with Jacob's Ladder and It (the whole clown thing) as the best fright-inducers of the decade.  It's biggest flaw might be word-of-mouth hype, because if you don't allow yourself to taken into a horror movie as a viewer, then nothing would scare you.  I also had to ask myself why would they bother to keep taping if they thought they were in such mortal danger, but obviously, the movie would fall apart if this aspect is noted.  I rate this a 7 out of 10, (definitely worth the price of admission) because this is a great original concept executed with great results, not perfect, and it is certainly not the scariest movie ever made, but it does sparkle.  This is a movie to see if you want to get a real pit in your stomach, and if you let it, it will.  After seeing this, you might think twice before going out in the woods ever again."

The sounds and the way it was filmed is what makes this movie an excellent horror flick.  The sounds are excellent.  The movie was filmed bad (because the camera movies up and down as the person holding it walks) but that only makes it more realistic since the person filming the movie is supposed to be one of the kids who is filming the documentary. ( not a person trained on how to use a camera.) It all goes along with making it seem like it is a true story.  This has to have been one of the best independent films I have seen since Halloween.

I say this because people in general have become de-sensitized to gore, blood, guts, violence, etc.  The Witch of this movie, her looks, her secrets, were left to the depth of the imagination, which is, a lot of times, more effective than actually seeing what it is we are fearing.

These kids are walking into their doom.  But who or what is waiting for them in the woods is not the magic of any Hollywood studio and refreshingly for that matter, neither is the script.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film, Blair Witch makes up for its shortcoming in its originality and its ability to conjure up excruciating tension.  It's like sitting in the dentist chair and waiting for him to come in for an hour and 20 minutes.   And then when he does, he just grabs the drill and turns off the lights - and leaves you there.

"John-405","Null","1","1","26 July 1999"," Wonderful -- definitely not ""Night of the Living Dead for the Millennium""
","No spoilers here, IMO, but read at your peril.<br/><br/>Most of the negative comments about this film seem to come from hard core horror buffs who fail to find it particularly frightening.  The problem is that hard core horror fans have been hooked on so much blood, gore and cheap frights that anything that asks them to use their imaginations is going to seem boring.<br/><br/>As someone who is not particularly a horror buff, I thought Blair Witch was brilliant.<br/><br/>I should say that I walked into the theater ignorant of any of the hype surrounding the film. I had seen a preview, and so knew the basic premise, but that was it.<br/><br/>The three principles are more or less completely believable, which is probably due to the fact that their situation in real life was as close as possible to their characters' situation.  They really were left to wander in the woods, and they knew only generally what they would find there.  <br/><br/>There is nothing profound about the film's content.  The 3 film students are typical slacker dumb bells, and they react to their situation with honest fright and little else. There is little time for philosophizing, but you get the feeling that even if there were these three would have little to say.<br/><br/>The brilliance of the film lies completely in its concept: the idea of throwing three actors in the woods and asking them to improvise on their own fear.  The result is extremely compelling and convincing.  There are little clues here and there that the 3 are acting, but, for the most part, they appear to actually be 3 people lost in the woods being terrorized by a coven of witches!<br/><br/>There is *one* glimpse of blood in the entire film and zero glimpses of the witches (or whatever they may be).  The horror is left entirely to the imagination and the oblique ending resists the urge to explain.  As the credits rolled, I was really grateful that the film makers hadn't tried to make this a ""Night of the Living Dead for the Millennium"".<br/><br/>Oh, and one other comment: Some reviewers have complained that it is unbelievable that Heather would keep filming, even when her life was in danger.  Actually, that is is not so hard to believe when you consider all of the documentary films that have been done in life-threatening situations during war time.  Heather may be a little more professional than you would expect a 20-something film student to be, but she's hardly unique or without example in real life.<br/><br/>J"

The last 20 minites totally steal the show in feelings of panic and dread.  I highly recommend catching this flick when it goes wide release on the 30. Hell, some movie companies are maneuvering their releases so they  don't have to compete with the wide release. Like Mystery Men and Deep Blue Sea.<br/><br/>

","This movie was freaky.  I know that that sounds a bit pedestrian but that's the only way that I can describe it.  The movie starts off appearing to be a couple of kids playing with a video camera.  As the movie progresses, it grows stranger and stranger.  Odd things begin happening to the three main characters but they write them off as just coincidences.  They soon find themselves in odd situations and unable to escape the woods.  That is all that I can say without giving away the entire plot.<br/><br/>The element that makes the movie so weird is the way it was filmed. The filmmakers kept it in its original 16mm format complete with shaky angles. They sure didn't use a steady-cam.  This movie is a definite for this summer.  I gave it an 8."

But into the movie, it starts to become a little obvious that Josh, Heather, and Mike start to do classic overacting. (This was supposed to be a real documentary, or at least plotted to be) The movie is full of suspense, such as hearing noises in the night, and alot of other spooky stuff. Let me warn you, I got seriously ill to my stomach from watching this movie. People that might be sensitive to the camera moving all over the place, shouldn't go see it.

","A lot of the reviews of this film have said the reason this is so good is it doesn't show anything, it lets you imagine it all, and that's the only way to make horror.  I think that's more than a bit simplistic.  After all, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EXORCIST, THE SHINING, and many other films cited as classics show a lot(if THE SHINING was truly ""suggestive,"" would we have seen the blood coming from the elevator?).  Nevertheless, they are right in praising this film.  It is entertaining and scary, and you do care about the three filmmakers and what happened to them.  It's not the best thing I've ever seen, but I had a good time at it."
"microbonnie","7","1","1","3 August 1999"," Creative and original idea not to be mimicked
","Brilliant idea:  a movie so realistic it's *real* until you know for sure that it's not.  The makers of this film went to so much trouble, in fact, to make it seem real, that even given that I knew it was just a movie, I had to reconvince myself it wasn't real after viewing the film and checking out the web site.  To be sure:  it's nice to believe it's real if you want to get really, really scared.  As a movie, though?  Mediocre.  They could have done more with the legend to build up the plot, without taking away from the ""real"" aspect one bit.  The footage they include doesn't include enough interviews or background to be pieced into a true documentary anyway.  I wasn't quite as afraid as I wanted to be, in all honesty.  If people try to copy this idea, however, they will FAIL.  This is the type of thing that can only be done once successfully.  I don't want to be going to a bunch of scary home movies and getting headaches all over the place every summer.  I recommend seeing this movie solely on its creativity, though."

","Truly this is the scariest movie I have seen for some time.  It proves that a good horror movie doesn't need a lot of blood, guts, or special effects to be effective.  Many have ranked this movie with Psycho, but I would definitely not go that far.  While it is scary in the night scenes, the day scenes tend to drag on.  I was always anxious for it to get dark again - when all the scary things happened.  In my opinion, Psycho never dragged along.  But, regardless, I am telling everyone I know to go see it.  It will most likely be their best scare for quite some time."

","I think it's the snuff film aspect of the exercise that's most captivating - the psychological verisimilitude inherent in the working method, coupled with the knowledge (from the opening caption) that there will be no happy ending, marks it as a morbidly voyeuristic exercise - but with a contemporariness that lends itself to a bandwagon and to mainstream respectability. The characterizations are well-judged, with the initial hubris of Heather's leadership providing the perfect springboard for the tensions that explode as their situation worsens - I didn't detect many false notes in it. It pushes all the buttons while remaining open to ambiguity and alternative interpretations, and on the whole seems to me to deserve its success for its fresh but respectful approach to the genre."

","I honestly don't know what to say about this film. So why am I writing, you ask? Because this film is possibly the best one I have seen in years. It is confusing, jaded, jarring, thrilling, and mystifying. The acting is superb, the production even better. Even an experienced film student walks away from The Blair Witch Project unsure of the true nature of the images on the screen. The barrier between fiction and non-fiction is truly tampered and disguised. And after much debate with many skeptics and cynics and filmmakers, I can only say that the only conclusion we have reached is that if it is crafted fiction - it is a supreme example of how a filmmaker can control sight and sound. And, of course, if it is non-fiction...<br/><br/>See it. It charmed and scared me."
"Tug-3","Null","1","1","2 August 1999"," It hit me where it hurts! (Warning: some possible spoilers)
","It is difficult for me to give an objective review of this film.  It is the most terrifying movie _I_ have ever seen, but my appraisal is, in this case, very subjective.  I was raised in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, where Jersey Devil lore still runs rampant and where, as recently as five years ago, a city-slicker couple got lost only ten miles away from the nearest paved road and starved to death.  I have always considered the woods to be sinister, and _Blair Witch_ might be the fulmination of all my unspoken fears.  It's pompous to say that whether or not you think this film is effective is dependent on how much imagination you have.  It is more accurate to say that your enjoyment of the movie is based on what sorts of fears you already have.<br/><br/>I am fairly certain that at some point, one of the filmmakers must have seen a low-budget 1984 movie called ""The Wind That Walks,"" which used to air every Halloween on the NJ PBS station.  Many elements of the movie seem borrowed from this short film about a scientist who mistakenly kills the Jersey Devil's offspring, including a reliance on sound effects to convey the unseen menace, jerky camera work, and even the same low-tech font in the credits.  All of my childhood friends were scared to death of this film -- another reason why _Blair Witch_ got to me at such a visceral level.<br/><br/>One recommendation.  As much as I liked this film, and as much as I want to see it succeed commercially, I must advise you to wait until it hits video stores.  Seeing this film in a theater is a bad idea, not because you might need a dramamine to get you through the more jerky scenes, but because any shuffling or coughing around you seriously detracts from its intensity.  You must play along with this movie: don't watch it guessing what horror cliche will show up next, but watch it as if you have uncovered some weird video that you are not supposed to see.  Think of it as an illicit snuff film, and you will be terrified."
"WDF","Null","1","1","23 July 1999"," great original psychological horror movie
","I saw this movie after hearing all of its hype and I was worried if it could deliver.  It did.  While I can easily see why some people would not like it (the shaky camera, leaving the terror to the imagination, etc.), I do think it is something that has to be approached with an open mind.  The film builds the suspense slowly, but by the end the last 10 minutes are the scariest 10 minutes ever put to film!  Congratulations to the filmmakers for making a completely original film experience."
"Nathanel","6","1","1","2 August 1999"," Inventive and original
","The Blair Witch Project had some pretty chilling moments. Some people in the theater were disappointed at the ending because the witch or whatever other horror was stalking the film students was never revealed. I thought the ending could have been a little better, but I liked the element of ambiguity and think that it adds to the terror of the movie. Being an avid woods man, I was annoyed with the stupidity of the students and how they handled their situation, but I guess it was necessary in order for the movie to work. Using the 16mm film added an incredible element of realism to the movie. This in my opinion was the movies strongest asset. The movie feels so believable  that many people in the theater actually thought they were watching real, authentic footage. The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie, and if one allows themselves to become one of the campers and accept what is happening on screen, the movie is pretty darn chilling."
"mermatt","8","1","1","2 August 1999"," Interesting study in the psychology of fear
","As a horror film, this is disappointing -- perhaps intentionally so to keep the audience talking about it after it is over. But as a study in the psychology of fear and self-fulfilling prophecy, the film works well. The moviemakers use fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, fear of the night, fear of unseen forces, fear of getting lost in the woods -- all very effectively.<br/><br/>While this is not in the same league as THE EXORCIST to which it has been sometimes compared in the PR hype, it is nevertheless a good example of the old rule of horror -- less is more. The people who remade THE HAUNTING could have taken a lesson from these people instead of relying mainly on FX for the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I think the unresolved ending is intentional to keep the word-of-mouth going. The Sci-Fi channel show ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" gives more information than the movie and is actually better than the movie. I think what we have here is the beginning of a legend. The Blair Witch myth is concocted solely for the film, but now the myth will begin to grow. Clever gimmick for a small-budget film!"
"Delerium","Null","1","1","1 August 1999"," The best horror movie in ages.
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror movie with no big name actors, no special effects, and no big budget. And yet, it is better than any recent horror movie I have seen. The horror is all psychological, relying on our own natural sense of fear.<br/><br/>Shot roughly on a Super 8 portable and a portable video camera, it is about three student film makers who travel into the Maryland woods where it is reputed to be haunted. The small town near the woods has a troubled past, and the locals tell tales of the ""Blair Witch"", which is a local myth and the subject of a documentary. As they shoot the documentary, they become hopelessly lost, unprepared, and turning on each other as their situation becomes worse. To make matters worse, they discover there really is something in the woods. <br/><br/>Because of the rough nature of the film, it is all the more realistic. You feel like you are out there with them, and the feeling of hopelessness rubs off on the audience. And since you are discovering things as they do, the horror is all the more real. As a movie, it is very unsettling and one that is sure to leave a lasting impression. Skillfully directed, and a premise that puts most horror movies to shame. I can safely say that I have never seen a movie like this one. One of the year's best. <br/><br/>Funny, but in a summer riddled with big budget action movies and garbage horror movies like ""Lake Placid"" and ""The Haunting"", a low budget indie film like ""The Blair Witch Project"" stands out as the best."

","I was fortunate to see this brilliant film the day after it's limited release opening on July 17th at the Main Art Theater in Royal Oak, Michigan. It's incredible.  The directors of this film prove that fancy cameras, high-paid actors, and overblown budgets cannot replace horrifying simplicity of sheer psychological terror.  It's unfortunate to think that many will see this film after TV advertising has started, and most major media will have revealed that this is a ""mockumentary"" not a documentary.  There is an added chill to seeing the film when there is the thought that these events may have actually happened.  No matter what your prior knowledge, see this film."

","Has there ever been so much hype for such a low-budget film? This film may have gotten a bigger push than any other low-budget movie in cinematic history, and in the end I believe it was hurt by this.<br/><br/>Not only was it being billed as ""the scariest movie ever"" but there were also rumors that these events actually occurred, and the film had been pieced together from actual footage (which is not true, of course). Whether or not the legend is real, I don't know, but it seemed real enough, where one might believe it actually happened. I felt the three actors involved were practically flawless, giving some of the most realistic performances I have ever seen; the fact that they ad-libbed all their lines must have helped them in this respect, but nonetheless they were excellent.<br/><br/>The problem I had with the film is that it isn't scary enough; there were more scenes where I found myself laughing than feeling scared, which was not the intent of the directors. It WAS eerie, I have no qualms about that, but it had the potential to be terrifying without wandering into the realm of ""campiness,"" and with a little more substance than innuendo it would have truly been a masterpiece (perhaps if they heard chanting at night instead of the all encompassing wood-snapping sound it would have been more effective at conveying the intense fear the characters must have felt which, judging by people's comments around me after it was over, was not accomplished). What is meant to be inferred or imagined is almost always more frightening than anything that can be portrayed on screen, but even the subtleties were TOO subtle, and they should have been a bit more graphic.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the film was terrifying and it wasn't until then that I felt truly frightened. There is something intrinsically creepy about the woods, but I think the film-makers relied to much upon that assumption."

","This movie took a while to really get going.  I suppose it's understandable that a certain amount of background information is necessary to get rolling on a movie like this, but be forewarned:  you might find the first hour or so a little boring! (I certainly did...)  That said, overall it's a damn good movie.  The suspense building up to the ending is nothing short of intense.  You are witness to the deterioration of these film students lost in the woods as they get more and more desperate to find their way back to civilization and an unknown presence that appears to be hunting them.  The background information on the movie is fairly compelling, I saw a special on the Sci-Fi channel after I watched the movie that made it more interesting. It is very hard not to ultimately get drawn into this movie after the boring sections.  You will be very surprised at the ending.  You will also not want to be in the woods at night for a long time.  If you don't catch this one in the theater, it's a definite rental for sure!!"

I must have a low tolerance for this kind of thing (I've had the same reaction trying to playing computer video games), but by the middle of TBWP I thought I'd have to leave the theater, I was feeling so nauseated.  I tried to exercise some control by looking away from the screen but my eyes were drawn back there because I wanted to see what was going on!  I thought that I might see something that the characters didn't.  Considering that I knew the premise beforehand, I was astounded at how much of a rise the movie got out of me, and I must admit that I bought the whole thing.

A local myth about a witch who was cast out by the town                              200 years before.

That being said, the filmmakers did right to max out their credit cards and beg their relatives for the $25K this supposedly cost (though that will be cranked through the indie myth machine until the buzz has our producers selling internal organs to pay for dubbing) since ""The Blair Witch Project"" is well above the mass of horror films served up from Hollywood.  And isn't that the point of an independent cinema, after all? Alternately frightening and amusing, this film will scare you if you let it run away with your imagination all the way into the final, terrifying sequence.

I think it would've helped if they built up the background story a little more.<br/><br/>That said, this isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it ranks pretty high up there. And when I say ""scary,"" I mean that in the sense that a very tense, uneasy atmosphere is maintained throughout the whole film (well, once they get lost, at least). You know you're never going to see the ""monster"" like in most horror movies, but the mystery just adds to the chills.

On a scale of one to ten(ten being the best) I'd give it a eight. Note to film makers, good job with this film, but you could have given a little credit to Mr. Deodato."
"Karen-47","Null","1","1","23 May 2000"," answer to poll question
","I chose The Blair Witch Project as the answer to the 5/23/00 daily poll question of what the worst movie to watch before a camping trip would be. However, I believe that The Blair Witch Project would be the worst movie to watch before breathing!  I can't understand how anyone was terrified by this movie.  The premise was good, and I can understand how a similar situation could be truly frightening.  But what truly terrified me was that with an investment of way under $100,000, the movie has made multi-millions of dollars.  Even walking in circles in Maryland, you'll come out somewhere that you'd recognize as civilization.  I found it very unrealistic and tedious, and it did not stimulate my imagination except to imagine life when the movie ended."

","First of all, let me say I DID enjoy this movie.  It was very clever, well acted, and quite creepy at times.  That said, I don't think I have ever looked so forward to a movie and been so disappointed. I can't believe that this was the movie that everyone has said is the scariest movie ever made, they are still having nightmares, can't walk in the woods in broad daylight, etc. I went expecting to be scared out of my wits. I made my husband go with me, I was so scared beforehand. (I am actually scared quite easily.) There was no need--I could've watched this alone, at midnight.  Like I said, I did like the movie.  I just don't understand what is supposed to be so terrifying about it. It was a really clever concept and was actually quite enjoyable.  And mind you, the things in the trees, the bundles of sticks, and the end (although very ambiguous)were really creepy. But people actually think this is scarier than ""The Exorcist""?  Please.  I will recommend it to my friends but I will tell them not to take a change of underwear.  They won't need it."

","Hard to say anything about this. Is it good ? Is it bad ? I don't know. I just know that I've sat during the movie nearly without any move, with full concentration, without thinking about anything else but the movie, what will happen next. It was so realistic. Is reality good or bad ? Does any of the ordinary categories for movies matter if its real, and not only a game ?<br/><br/>This movie focuses enormously, nay in an ideal way, on the character development. There is no sudden change, no compression of the emotions, like normally in movies. Everything happens in a way and speed normal emotions of real people would develop. If the characters had changed very much, there had been a pause of some hours where they didn't used the camera. I repeat myself, everything here looks totally real. I've never seen that in this degree in a movie before. And I'm wondering why I've never missed that in all these comedies and tragedies and maladies (french: illnesses) I've seen before. So often I've called a movie ""realistic"" before, not knowing that it wasn't realistic at all, compared with this reference.<br/><br/>This is not a horror movie. Read it again: this is not a horror movie. One could say much about the properties of all horror movies I've seen before, brutal, idiotic, boring, or sometimes funny, and some classical movies (such as Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)) even brilliant - but they where never, never realistic. I often cursed inside when I saw how illogical people behave in ordinary horror movies. Not here. No way. So at least if you're a fan of horror movies, you are not at all guaranteed to like this one, for its so different.<br/><br/>The screen picture is often of very bad quality, especially in the night. Is this a fault or an advantage ? Of course, this is also realistic; the ears gets more informations what's happening than the eye in the night.  <br/><br/>So what should I say ? Who could enjoy this movie ? I've no clue. I guess that many horror fans might even hate it. Everyone might hate it. But everyone might also love it. I've no clue, except that I think (I'm not finally sure!) I myself liked it.<br/><br/>Will there ever be a movie like this so successful ? I think so. It has very big faults, but also big strengths, and I think its strength are the more important ones. Again, I'm not sure. I don't know if I've seen a revolution or a bad joke of a movie."
"Candy-7","Null","1","1","13 November 1999"," Less is not always more
","Being a life-long avid movie fan, I look forward to any movie which offers a new concept or approach to movie making. And, since many of the best recent movies are from the independent film makers, I always anticipate eagerly a new film which does not rely on the presence of a highly-paid superstar for its appeal. Having said that, I must say that, in my opinion, the money that I wasted to rent The Blair Witch Project did not anger me half as much as the precious time that I spent waiting for the moment that never came-the moment when I could say ""Aha, THIS is what scared all of those movie-goers I saw interviewed on television!"" That moment never came. Oh, I paid attention to the plot. I had seen the Sci Fi special previously, so I knew what was supposed to be happening. And I certainly do not subscribe to the theory that a movie must have explicitly visual gore in order to be frightening- in fact, when it comes to horror, the less is actually shown, the more frightening the effect. One's imagination holds more horrors than any movie scene can ever visually present. But this movie failed miserably in its attempt to frighten, for several reasons.<br/><br/>The primary reason for the failure of this movie is its inability to make the audience care for the victims. I was so glad that they got what they deserved that I never for an instant felt any empathy with their situation. I am not a prude, by any means, but the language in this movie was unnecessarily foul, and its only effect was to make the characters totally unloveable. By comparison, the repetitive use of the ""F"" word by Joe Pesci's character in Good Fellas contributed to the plot and character definition- not so with Blair Witch.<br/><br/>I did not think that the poor quality of the filming itself was a detraction-rather, it contributed to the premise of the movie. But the lack of character development, the poorly explained ""threat"" of the witch, the jerky, uneven plot- all combined to create one of the biggest wastes of my time in recent history. If it is not too late- do not waste your time and money."

","The question is this. Why was Blair Witch Project so successful? The answer is simple. Because there are a lot of people in the United States that are very stupid and gullible. Who went to see this thinking it was real. Believing that a snuff film would be a summer release. People say Hollywood insults their intelligence, but after the success of Blair Witch, I wonder if the mass audience has any intelligence to insult.<br/><br/>
This is an amateurish gimmick movie. No more, no less.<br/><br/>I can only hope nobody wastes their time making a knock off version of Blair Witch, because as stupid as this MTV generation might be, I don't think you can fool them twice.<br/><br/>Note: Blair Witch was shot on video and 16mm.

","What can be said about this film? If you are looking for instant scares (i.e. Scream, IKWYDLS) then this film is not for you.<br/><br/>The clever aspect of this movie is that it is not overly scary as you actually watch it.  It is after the film has ended and you think back over what you have witnessed when it has its full effect.  The Blair Witch Project may well have you scared to get up in the night for weeks.<br/><br/>The best way to describe this film would be to say that it does not offer you any relief from you fear.<br/><br/>In the majority of horror or scary films,the viewer sucks their breath in and curses at the stupid person who is cautiously going up the stairs to investigate the scary noise that came from up there moments ago.  The viewer then breathes a sigh of relief when it is discovered that it was simple a cat knocking over a vase. TBWP does not offer you the chance to breathe that sigh of relief, you are simply left on edge because whatever is making the noise is left anonymous.<br/><br/>The idea of leaving so many questions unanswered is genius.<br/><br/>Look at it this way - when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a strange noise you get scared, however you are relieved when you realise that it is simply your parents going to bed or the central heating going off. TBWP does not resolve your fear, you are left wondering what the noise was. <br/><br/>To summarise; the noises you hear in the night are always more frightening that whatever is actually making them."

","This makes one of over 1500 entries about this film, and I've not seen one critique yet that's middle of the road. <br/><br/>There seem to be many factors at work here. The arguments range from ""if you're from the city, you won't get it"" to ""the production values suck.""<br/><br/>I'm sure that things such as one's background, to one's expectations, have a lot to do with the incredibly divergent attitudes about this film.<br/><br/>There are reports of people walking out, and others of people being riveted to the screen. In the end, opinions are like rear ends - everyone has one. So, if you're interested - I'll just tell you about my experience....because to me BWP was an experience.<br/><br/>I went to see it based on the hype. I read brief synopsis' on it at Artisan's web site. I had little knowledge of the story aside from the ""teaser."" The theater I saw it in was small, probably seating 200 maximum - and it was 95% full. No one walked out. No one laughed inappropriately. No one made comments. What I experienced was an audience captivated by a film that could very well have been splices of ""home movies"" made by genuine amateur filmmakers. The 20-somethings act the way I have observed many of them acting - using the ""f"" word often and without reason. In addition the fear and subsequent babbling and weird behavior seemed real (I'm speaking from personal experience).<br/><br/>When this film ended, the audience was stunned, and for what seemed a long time, no one headed for the exits. I usually stay to read credits, while everyone heads out the door (sometimes being rewarded when the occasional out-takes follow some films). When the first person began to leave, the credits were nearly complete. It's the first time I've seen a reaction like this, ever, and I've been to thousands of films.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt I was given enough knowledge from the interviews to understand that whatever it was these kids were seeking, was an entity the town-folk didn't want to deal with, regardless of their points of view.<br/><br/>It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, caused me to sink a bit lower in my seat, and even though during the last minute or 2, I guessed what the last scene would be, it still took me by surprise.<br/><br/>I have no opinion on those of you who didn't like it, or weren't somewhat scared, because, after all we're all different - and liking or not liking something doesn't make folks in either camp more or less intelligent than those in the other. It's all just reflections of our backgrounds, religious upbringing, environments, etc. <br/><br/>What I do have an opinion on is, despite my feelings of this being an unique look at an eerie subject, that for the guys who wrote and directed, this may be only a one time shot at using the method for creating this true ""horror"" film. Best of the year? Hard to say. Maybe not, but pretty damned creative. I like films such as ""In Country,"" and ""Inside Moves"" (both widely ignored by critics and filmgoers alike) and I only watch ""Law & Order"" or ""Homicide - Life on the Street"" on TV (damn NBC!).<br/><br/>And, I liked BWP, because it made me afraid for awhile and caused me to think about it long afterwards. When a film makes me feel, it works for me. I'd recommend it - with the preface that not everyone is gonna like this film. It's one of my 50 favorites, but I may not see it or watch it again for awhile. I keep seeing that last scene......"

The writers of the movie went to Wheaton high school which is also a short distance from my home.  So you can imagine why I liked this movie.

I am a big fan of scary movies and wanted to see what made this movie so different from the rest of the pack.  I appreciate the fright factor in the film.  The fact that there is no bad guy is a very different concept and a chilling one at that.  In all of the scary movies that I've seen there is a bad guy who invades your thoughts and you end up thinking about that night in your darkened bedroom.  But in this movie there was no bad guy... which seemed to me to be ten times scarier.  While I was watching the movie, I anticipated much more than was shown to me on the screen.  I kept waiting for something to happen... yet hardly anything did.  Here I can see why people did not like the movie.  The element of the movie is suspense, but in our society we are used to thrills and chills and immediate action.  The ending had my friends and me arguing for weeks.  Ambiguous endings can be good for a film.  In that way, you can put your own spin on what just happened on the screen.  When the movie ended, I was initially disappointed.

No, this isn't the greatest horror film ever made but it wasn't terrible. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD While the actual night attacks weren't so much scary as just confusing, the finale in the shack was truly nerve-wracking.  The house itself was a brilliant example of shooting in the exact right location.  The acting was okay but the improvised nature of the performances had definite drawbacks -- for instance, the two guys tended to switch personalities from scene to scene.  While it was obvious that Heather was ""acting"", it actually worked as evidence of her character's desire for everything to be a movie.  The story behind the film is more interesting than the film itself but on the whole, the Blair Witch Project is neither the disaster nor the masterpiece that everyone else seems to be making it out to be.  I doubt that directors will ever do anything else of note but they have nothing to be ashamed of with this project. As for the most frightening movie ever made (or at least the most frightening that I've ever seen), I'd have to go with the Shining.  Its the only horror film I've ever seen where just thinking about some of the images can still make me jumpy."
"aaaa","Null","1","1","4 September 1999"," Naysayers, get this for once..
","If you want to see a special effects horror movie like every other horror movie you've ever seen just because you're comfortable with the formula, there's a movie out called ""The Haunting.""  Compare the two and enjoy.<br/><br/>First of all, let's straighten this out:<br/><br/>1.  This is not a movie.  It's a trip into your imagination.  You don't watch ""actors"" and ""acting"" or monsters or gallons of blood.  You immerse yourself into the environment.  You pretend it's real, not because you have to, but because that's what any good movie does.  It convinces you that this could happen in a given scenario, whether it be an action movie or a comedy.<br/><br/>2.  See a doctor.  If motion sickness bothers you that much, either you're either very feeble or couldn't handle even stepping into a Six Flags themepark anyway.  In that case, why see a ""horror"" movie?  Your personal problem has no bearing on the quality of a movie, just as my being thirsty because I didn't drink anything beforehand has no bearing on the movie.<br/><br/>3.  You are, were, or will be a teenager.  Teenagers act very much like this.  They swear, they try to be entertaining, they rip each other's throats when their own personal ground is stepped on.  If you aren't in highschool or college, at least imagine yourself to be.  The same goes with any movie of a different age group, from ET to Message in a Bottle, you need to relate to the characters emotions based on your imagination, regardless of who you are.  You are the characters.  You see what they see.  You go through all the trauma they go through.<br/><br/>4.  The cameras have personalities.  Remember the b&w camera is the 'documentary' camera, used for high quality shots.  These scenes themselves are fine for an amatuer video.  The color camera shown through most of the movie is the girl's own personal recording of the events.  It's not supposed to be a convincing display of student filmmaking.  It's her life as she sees it, and she can shake it, put it on the ground, and even p**s on it because it was never intended for you to see this.  This is her personal footage and has no bearing over who sees it later in a theatre (looking from the character's point of view of course).<br/><br/>5.  Forget the hype.  Use your own personal judgement.  Skip past the commercials if you can.  Never expect anything better than your own imagination.  Especially for this movie.  <br/><br/>6.  Forget the premise.  The backstory that this is supposedly a true story is only meant to make clueless people wonder, which only makes the people who really know smile more.  But don't expect yourself to fall for it.  Just enjoy it.  And remember you can look at the plot from either Mulder or Scully viewpoint.  Mysticism or perverted human toying is up to you to decide.  It can happen either way.<br/><br/>7.  This is not a movie.  It has no special effects.  It has no top notch video camera with great angles and perfect lighting.  It has no celebrities. This is not a Hollywood movie.  You can rent plenty of Hollywood movies. This is a test of your thoughts and your emotions.  So sit back and relax. And enjoy the dark for once."

","Okay, okay, so it's low-budget. Think about why (just for a second, though--the movie really isn't worth that much thought). Were these two cinema dilettantes millionaires? did they have slick access to millions? No. They had, what? Thirty grand. So they made a movie with what they had. To consider it a stroke of genius that they made something low-budget is to give the filmmakers too much respect; they did what they could with what they had. It was not a choice, but rather a necessity.<br/><br/>
That aside, I would like to mention that although easily the most enticing part of the whole show, the pedestrian cinematography and is-it-real-or-is-it-not debate works as much against the movie as it does for it. I found myself picking the movie apart as it progressed, determining for myself the parts that showed it to be just a thirty-thousand pet project. Oh? Piles of stones? Hmmm...verdict? Cheesy! Of course this isn't real! But hey, she looks kinda scared...verdict? Cheesy! Who really swears that much when they really know what they want to say? Of course this movie's a fake! They're searching for their lines amidst massive quantities of vulgar expletives!<br/><br/>Final verdict: This is one for the marketing execs' books, but overall it's a gimmicky piece of crap, and I live in fear of what it may spawn. The Children of the Blair Witch? I guess it's time to start bringing Dramamine to the local multiplex."

","Even after the substantial amount of hype surrounding this film before it was released nationwide, I still find this the scariest film I have ever seen.  The concept was fresh and original: a group of college kids hiking through the woods looking for clues as to the legend of the Blair Witch, shot as a documentary.  From what I hear, the story and myth was a fabrication of the directors and the actors improvised the majority of the film.  Even after knowing all that, it was still an extraordinarily effective horror film.  The realism of the picture is what heightened the intensity.  The absence of a suspenseful score, ""fake"" scares and even a visible villain brought it above the recent ""Scream""-style genre invading cineplexes today.  The most effective special effect ""The Blair Witch Project"" uses is the audience's imagination.  Our imaginations are so wild and vivid; it taps into our worst nightmare in various moments of the film. What I have learned as a child is that the noise in the dark is, usually, ten times scarier than what makes the noise in the dark.  The performances were realistic and very emotional.  The three actors displayed the most impressive improvisation I have ever witnessed.  Heather Donahue gives an emotional and powerful performance, one of the best performances by an actress of the year.  Also, the ending is one of the most hair-raising climaxes ever put on film.  My heart was racing until its abrupt end, leaving me a very satisfied customer.  See this film while it's still playing on the big screen; trust me, it's worth it.  Or you can wait until it debuts on video October 26th.  Either way, experience the most terrifying motion picture of the century."

","The Blair Witch Project was an interesting film that had a very unique concept. The story was well conceived and the sheer reality of the filming effects helped to make it more believable. The acting was fine given the premise of how the directors operated (limited scripts and a lot of adlibbing)and the scariest movies are the ones that really make you think and disturb you for days afterward (which this one did). The shaky camera technique and the disappointment of never seeing much of anything kept the movie from being more enjoyable. I think even a glimpse of what they were seeing would have been sufficient. I view this film as being much like an episode of the X-Files, but not even as good as some of those. At least with the X-Files there's a payoff...and although things on that show are not often wrapped up in a tidy package that's easy for everyone to live with, there is a creepy chill that stays with you, makes you think and long to see more. I wanted to see what happened after the films were discovered and brought back to town. I wanted to see what was being shown and written on the Internet site that helped hype the movie. Bottom line...better than most horror films, but not the best I've seen. Left me wanting too much."

The acting is incredible, true human nature, no heroes, just real people reacting in ""real situations"". I consider this movie to be a myth-breaker, no fancy camera work, or incredible special effects, not even music was needed to get the audience so involved in the story.

I had a splitting headache by the end. If you tend to get motion sickness, you may wish to avoid this film.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project represents the maximum result with a minimum budget. Unlike many low-budget films, it stays within its means. The film could not have been improved by putting more money into it. The acting was likewise very good.<br/><br/>I'm not sure, however, that this was cut out to be a feature film. At 80 minutes it falls well short of full-length, but it felt more like 100 or 110 to me. The dialogue was repetitive, but little could be done to vary it. I would have enjoyed the film far more if it were 60 minutes. And maybe paired with another shorter film.<br/><br/>I would also recommend not viewing this in the theater. The picture is filmed completely on videotape and 16mm, so the wide screen gives you no advantage. Unlike most horror films, The Blair Witch Project uses no shocking visual effects to frighten the audience. I found it difficult to be frightened by pure suspense in a crowded theater. The imagination runs much more freely at home. I reserve final judgement on this one until I've seen it after midnight at a party with just a couple friends in a house in the middle of nowhere. . ."

The tagline gives away the ending - after all, only the footage was found, right? - but I was still at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>Many of the people leaving the theatre were complaining that it was boring, and that they expected a real ""horror"" film.

","Don't panic. I won't spoil the flick.<br/><br/>That would be cruel.<br/><br/>I just survived the new independent film, ""The Blair Witch Project."" If you haven't heard about this movie, and that is only possible if you have been living on a submarine for the last seven months, it focuses on three college film makers who, in the fall of 1995, trot off into the Maryland woods in search of the fabled ""Blair Witch."" Unfortunately, they never returned from their little jaunt in the forest. A group of anthropology students stumbles upon a duffel bag filled with their film canisters nearly a year after their disappearance.<br/><br/>The film is pieced together from their original footage by a film crew hired by the families of the three missing students. What results is a 120 minute spine chill. The chill originates when you realize that these three seemingly happy kids are going to come to their untimely demise at some point in the film. You have no clue how this is going to happen. You simply know that it IS going to happen. From there, the film, combined with your imagination, proceed to jar you repeatedly right up to the end credit. That is right. CREDIT. Exactly ONE credit. Less than they would have gotten for completing the film for their film class. That would probably be worth three credits.<br/><br/>Advice for when you see it. You will see it. I know. You won't be able to resist. You can feel it now. She is calling you. The Blair Witch. If you weren't working right now, you'd be at the cineplex. You might even be planning your own escapade with the kids into the woods for a nice family weekend. Don't. Don't do it. She's out there. I know it. Logically, I know that the film was shot in Maryland. I know that I live in Arizona. That just doesn't matter. She's out there. Oh... I was going to give some advice. Unless you are an avid operator of a small hand held video camera, and you walk around with this camera glued to your right eye 24 hours each day, you will feel ill as the camera jumps and hops around in the hands of these young film makers. Do you remember that feeling that you get when you are leaned back in a chair and you lean back just a hair too far? Do you remember the disorienting sensation of having to promptly right yourself lest you land on the floor? Good. Now magnify that feeling times 120 minutes. Take Dramamine. I nicknamed the camera in the hands of the girl (Heather) the ""Dram-a-cam."" I started to thank God every time she would steady the camera for more than two seconds. Don't eat a heavy meal before seeing this film, either.<br/><br/>Now, some advice for the parents out there. This film is rated R and then some. Not because of any real violence. In fact, the R is probably only for the kid's frequent use of the ""f"" word. Even that isn't so bad, really. I think that this film received its ""R"" for the fact that the rating panel was too shaken to write the letters ""PG-13."" They said, ""To heck with this. It ain't a G so I'm picking the only other one-letter rating and then I'm going home to hide under my bed."" This flick will give YOU nightmares. Don't even think of letting the cherished fruit of your union see this one. This is what you were put on this earth to protect them from.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. You NEED to see this film. And trust me. There is nothing in the film that is worse than your own imagination.<br/><br/>Fear the dark. <br/><br/>-Clint Potts, Chandler, AZ"

I've heard other people say ""This movie is horrible."" I decided to go see it and make my own decision.<br/><br/>  A friend and I went to a Matinee, there was about 4 or 5 other people in the theater. Throughout the 90's we've been exposed to some of the most god awful horror movies of our time, but this was a definent change of pace. This movie is a lot better than any horror I've seen in a long time. It doesn't take special fx to scare people, and this movie proves that. I really liked Blair Witch Project, but it didn't scare me much. The last 10mins or so was the only scary part of the movie. The final images in this movie will be in your head for days. Other than the last bit, I wasn't terribly frightened as some people have been. It was more of a thriller.<br/><br/>  No one is going to enjoy this film if they didn't pay attention at the beginning when they were interviewing the towns people. If you didn't listen to the conversations you wouldn't understand what was going on in the woods (the piles of rocks, etc). The stupidist people in the world were sitting in front of me during this movie. Halfway through the movie when they come back to the same log they were at eariler, a person in front of us asked, ""Why is she crying?

","Cynics has butchered this movie into pieces, calling it nothing but cheap footage of three people screaming, swearing and smoking. I thought I was going to be one of those cynics, but after viewing, I was pleasantly surprised. Okay, so the hype may be excessive, and the editing was a bit too neat for it be considered ""real footage"", but overall it was a genuinely creepy, thoroughly fascinating and innovatively made film. It's not very scary, definitely not as terrifying as ""The Exorcist"", but it's harrowingly realistic footage style is a refreshing change from everyday blood-and-guts material. ""The Blair Witch Project"" has been called ""a masterpiece"" and ""brilliant"", I wouldn't go that far, but it's movie that definitely stands above the rest, proving that the most effective chills are through minimalism. The two eeriest parts for me were the ""What the f**k is that???!"" chase through the woods (which looked extremely menacing) and the very final scene, which was just chilling to bone. The performances by the three actors were impressive, especially Heather Donahue's. Although they are screaming hysterically at each other most of the time, we were still able understand perfectly why they were so angry and terrified. More information on the Blair witch would of made the movie a bit more clearer, we would of known what exactly was so horrific about her, the makers should of made Heather recite more passages out of her book. The famous ""I'm so sorry"" speech given by Heather near the end unfortunately had no effect on me, but I'm pretty sure it wigged out some people. So in all, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has a few flaws, but it's definitely a horror film worth seeing."

","The Blair Witch Project flounders helplessly without a cohesive script, stranded in the horror hierarchy just one notch above the story about the escaped mental patient with a claw for a hand. (And then... they found a hook dangling from the car door!)<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a movie that is desperately, desperately in need of a script. It has a story, it even has a plot of sorts. But virtually every line of dialogue committed to film is ad-libbed, and it shows. Painfully. The basic story elements (creepy undefined horror in woods, cocky filmmakers go out to chase it, and the horrible clever ending which I won't reveal) float freely in a swampy morass of random noise from our 3 stars. And every third sentence, of course, invokes that sacred refrain of the indie film, the word 'f**k'.<br/><br/>Being a hard-core fan of H.P. Lovecraft, the basic premise of the Blair Witch Project sounded great to me. Three innocent kids go into the back woods of New England and are driven insane by an unspeakable eldritch horror. Groovy, right? The problem is, the horror is so unspeakable, and so eldritch, that it becomes unfilmable, too. The Blair Witch Project has absolutely zero explanation of the Witch's nature, and the viewer is left more confused than tantalized. I'm not suggesting that what was needed was footage of the actual Witch, but a sense of closure, provided more by the story than the action.<br/><br/>I realize people make a big stink about Blair's 'unorthodox' and 'refreshing' new style, but I prefer to think of it as cheap and insulting. I'm not saying I wanted to see CGI bursting from every frame (perish the thought), but some basic competence would have been nice. I realize the film makers are shooting for the pseudo-documentary look, but the results do not justify the premise. Heck, the movie would have been a lot more interesting if the witch was pitted against a professional documentary crew.<br/><br/>The fact that The Blair Witch Project is so believable actually stems from its greatest weakness: it looks  exactly like what would happen if you and your buddies grabbed a camcorder and went off into the woods to hunt ghosts. In the end, what Blair Witch lacked wasn't a larger budget, or special effects, or computers, or big-name stars, but simple screenwriting. It's hard to believe that the directors of the Project had any directing to do; they just had to hunt through the actors' film and edit together a semi-coherent chunk of movie."
"Roddy-15","Null","1","1","27 August 1999"," Scary
","It is hard to believe that a low budget horror film like this can actually deliver the goods: to scare viewers. In a time when special effects seem to be the most important aspect of movies, Blair Witch Project offers something different. It is one of those rare movies which can make people inside a theater be quiet. When I saw it, everyone inside the theater was quiet during the scary scenes. When was the last time that happened?<br/><br/>Blair Witch can be compared to an Italian movie named Cannibal Holocaust; they both have something in common: they are about people who disappear, and then their footage is found. Yet Cannibal Holocaust wasn't scary at all. Blair Witch is a good horror movie.<br/><br/>Of course, there are many people who won't like it. If you are expecting special effects or a typical horror movie, then you are probably one of the many people who will hate this one. Those who want to be scared, well, that's a different story."

The running scene scared me a lot - I'll admit.  The crying scene has been so horribly pillaged at this point that it did nothing for me.  But overall, this didn't do for my blood pressure what I'd been looking for it to do for months.<br/><br/>The ending was awful.  The video quality was shoddy, although this did add to the experience of the picture.  The language led this viewer to believe that much of the dialogue was unscripted and unrehearsed.

Personally, if I heard all those noises in the middle of some redneck woods (Especially the laughing/screaming children) I would sh*ttin' bricks. It shows the stages of denial, insanity, acceptance, fear, hatred, blame, and many others not necessarily in that order as these three emotionally different characters bumble through the woods trying to get a grip on reality. Until I noticed that this film was in fact written and directed by some guy, I thought this was the real deal.

","First, I'd like to say that there are spoilers in this review, although I will warn again right before I give them.<br/><br/>This movie scared the crap out of me, which is very unusual.  I am usually only creeped out if I watch a movie at home alone in the dark in the middle of the night; in this case, I saw the movie with friends in a crowded theatre and it was still light out when we exited the theatre.  Admittedly, I wasn't petrified at first.  When we really got scared was when we were walking back to our hotel (as we were visiting a friend of mine) in an area that seemed to have an aversion to street lights.  It was very dark and it did not help that we were walking by bushes.  We were all totally freaked out and kept looking around behind us.  We had the last scene of the movie stuck in our heads, and it stayed there.  I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had to leave a light on when I went to sleep.  I haven't done that since I was 7 and saw an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, where the almost-final image of a girl hung outside on the door of her home stayed with me for days.  Any movie that can have this kind of an effect on me is pretty unusual.  Even now, when I'm thinking about the final scene of this movie, I am getting somewhat creeped out.  The movie was highly disturbing, simply because it seemed so real and we DON'T actually know what happened. I am also with the group that thinks the acting was good; I think that in many cases they weren't acting.  For example [WARNING: spoilers ahead!!!], when that one guy disappeared in the middle of the night, I would not be surprised at all if the other two did not know that was going to happen. Likewise, at the very end of the film, I wouldn't be surprised if the girl didn't know when she'd enter the basement, Mike would be standing in the corner.  It really seemed to me like she was having a massive panic attack, at more than one point in the movie.<br/><br/>In any case, I highly recommend this film to anyone that wants to be scared out of their wits."

They soon get tired and frightened of him, and eventually their lighting man is killed. This scene includes a frantic chase up a flight of stairs in an abandoned warehouse, with displacement of sound due to the distance of the sound man. The scene then goes down the stairs into a dark basement, which is lit only by the new lighting man.

My wife and I almost missed the ending because we were fighting so hard to stay awake. I found the Sci-Fi Channel special, ""Curse of the Blair Witch"", to be much more frightening because it gives much more of the background stories about the legend of the witch, Coffin Rock and the child murderer in the 1940's. If you want my advice, get a copy of ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" from the Sci-Fi Channel, wait for ""The Blair Witch Project"" to come out on video, rent it for $3 (instead of paying $16+ to see it at the movies), fast forward to the last 15 minutes, watch ""Curse..."" and then watch the last 15 minutes of the video.

Also, whenever I am walking and am arguing with someone, I tend to walk faster; I don't stop, sit and pout like these babies did. Their constant stopping and camping seemed like the horror film cliche of the girl running upstairs rather than out the door.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that I didn't like the movie, it was OK (thanks to a great ending).

","I saw this movie before I read any reviews on imdb. After going back and reading dozens of them, I realize that many people were unfortunately victims of the hype. By that I don't mean they went to a movie that wasn't worthy of their hard-earned money, but rather they went expecting something other than what the movie delivered.<br/><br/>I think the critics loved it so much because it was fresh, unique, original, riveting, well-acted, and because they hadn't been told ahead of time that it was the scariest movie of all time. And, by the way, it isn't.<br/><br/>However, if you enter the theater with the only idea that you are going to accept the premise for what it is and go along for the ride and don't expect a Hollywood ending (which would be impossible anyway if it were truly a real story), then you will be more than entertained. I was and so was my wife.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it scary, but I would call it creepy - very creepy. And, it leaves you with some questions that you want to be left with. I mean it would take another hour or more to have answers. The idea is that a film made by dead kids in the forest is found. Do you think they had time to wrap up a perfect ending just immediately before they were killed???? I don't think so.<br/><br/>As to the jerky camera movements. All I can say is that I get sea sick on the water as well as queasy when I view surround video. And, I don't like roller coasters, etc. Nevertheless, shortly after the movie began, I didn't think about it again. I was too wrapped up in the adventure."

","*****Possible spoiler here*****<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project trod upon new ground in filmmaking in that it let the viewer's imagination fill in (some but not enough of) the voids left out of the actual film footage.  Objectively speaking, this movie accurately portrayed increasing feelings of despair, fear, and hopelessness as experienced first hand.  I experienced a true sense of fear and even dread a few times during some of the night sequences.  I never knew what was going to materialize out of the darkness, and when the lights came on it was almost worse.  The daytime sequences were too ""real"".  Imagine shooting video while running through a wooded area looking through the viewfinder. My wife literally got nauseous.  My advice?  Borrow two expensive camcorders, give one to a friend and tape each other running aimlessly through a wooded area shouting the ""F"" word about once every 10 seconds or so.  Be sure to include some too-close close ups and some night shots of nothing in particular.  Continue until both cameras are broken.  Now sit down together and figure out how you're going to explain the broken equipment.  That's watching ""The Blair Witch Project"" in a nutshell, feelings and all."

","Over 1000 comments on IMDB all ready?  Then theres not much else I can add except what some others have said.  This couldve been a lot more if they had cut some of the blah blah blahing and threw in a few more scares.  I know you have to have some talking in movies but how many times are you willing to watch the same people say the same stuff day after day.  Each morning starts with ""lets go this way"" and by afternoon its ""you blankety blank you got us lost!""  Then by nightfall we wait for a witch that never comes.  It wasnt till the third night I think, that the kids tent gets attacked by ""something"" in only one of two really effectively scary scenes.  Theyre sent screaming into the woods and its pretty creepy stuff.  Not much happens till the final 5 minutes when the filmmakers think theyve found their lost buddy in an abandoned house.  Though the film disappointingly ends so abruptly, it does give you a lot to talk about ""what Mike was doing in the corner.""  Id say yes it was an extremely unique idea for a terror film but no to the uniqueness of the setting.  I mean, havent woods been spooky in movies for years?  It couldnt help but add the films eerie atmosphere.  And be forewarned about the dizzying camera movements at times, where the actual filmmakers wanted to add realism to the documentary style idea by having the shots not be perfect at times.  Though not a great movie, still very interesting."

Please!<br/><br/>No movie is going to appeal to EVERYONE. Lesson number one, guys! Blair Witch is NOT meant to be conventional, or like your typical horror movie. There are no obvious and contrived jolts or scary moments to make you jump out of your seat. You want conventional, go see ""The Haunting"". The only thing that'll scare you about that movie is the money you wasted on it. Blair Witch is not about those silly little horror film conventions. It's not about a monster hunting three kids. It's all about psychological horror -- watching three people steadily go crazy and turn on each other for a time. It's about suspense and build up, not payoff. I thought the ending was brilliant. It left you asking questions.<br/><br/>I credit the filmmakers for taking huge risks in style and technique. For turning a wholly noncommerical project into a commerical success.

","Being in the woods in the middle of nowhere is scary in and of itself-scarier when you tell ghost stories-scarier still when you're in a ghost story. This simple truth has finally been exploited to(almost)maximum effect and create a truly gripping movie.<br/><br/>Blair Witch Project is a brilliantly conceived and executed film<br/><br/>that unfortunately cuts itself too short just as it's momentum finally starts to build to a fever pitch. The situation for the three protagonists gets increasingly desperate and weird and genuinely scary but the climax is overly abrupt to say the least and leaves the viewer distinctly unsatisfied(although the last shot is haunting). <br/><br/>The film also spends too much time concentrating on the three tired young filmmakers bickering amongst each other and basically breaking down mentally(although the actors all give very impressive performances-It's easy to forget that this is a movie and not a documentary while you're watching it). These scenes are very well done but go on too long and it's nothing you haven't seen in Deliverance. They detract from the overall impact in the long run. <br/><br/>I would still recommend this film but I have to admit I needed just a little more gore and a little less mystery."
"astrobuk","Null","1","1","13 August 1999"," Not as scary as led to believe
","First off this movie was creepy, but not bone jarringly terrifying as I was led to believe by reviewers (amateur or professional) and friends.<br/><br/>I actually found the Sci-Fi Channel's special to be more frightening than the movie itself. As soon as the line about the kids disappearing runs you know the outcome of the movie.<br/><br/>
Negatives of the movie: 1.  The characters.  Early on, all of this freaky stuff is going on & they're still worried about getting the rented equipment back. 2.  The fact that not one of them, even Josh the hippy, can figure out to follow the river/stream.  I've been in college a good while now, and camping is one of top activities of college students.  You pick up on things like following streams pretty early on in your camping life.  People might say I'm nit-picking the movie, but come on.  Then again they were Film Students... 3.  The end of the movie.  Quite frankly people won't understand the end unless they are paying rapt attention to the beginning.  Unfortunately, that is almost impossible with large # of teenagers in the audience.<br/><br/>Positives: 1.  It's surprisingly funny.  Many of the lines were well received by the audience. 2.  You grow a bond with the characters with or without your consent.  I knew the movie was fake from the get go, and I was still able to form a bond with the characters. 3.  It's really creepy.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie would have been much, much scarier if the directors would have kept the fact that it was fake longer.  Just have the end credits say something like ""Footage compiled by..."" instead of the full credits at the end."

","There are many reasons that this is one of the best movies to date. First, the marketing that has been done with this movie is phenomenal. Who would believe that such a low-profile movie could fool so many? People are often the most scared of the unknown, and this is exactly what this movie created. The ploy to ""trick"" John Q. Public into believing that the whole plot really happened worked and many were left to wonder if it was real or not. Second, the acting in Hollywood doesn't get any better than in this movie. The actors were not given a set script and were allowed a lot of freedom in their characters. Because the acting is so believable, you often find yourself feeling the same emotions that the characters are feeling. Third, the American film-making dream is lived through The Blair Witch Project. This movie was made for an incredible six-figure budget and has already made millions. What young film maker hasn't already wished that they had thought of it first? Sure, it could have all been shot with professional equipment, but what fun would that be?"

The Blair Witch Project is a minimalistic, yet originative approach at film-making. It's very frightening, and it adds to that with it's shakey camera angles and lengthy blackout periods.

","I applaud the unique, un-cliche-ridden approach that the filmmakers took with their ""Blair Witch Project"".  It is very refreshing to see a horror film that doesn't breakdown into all the predictable and ridiculous situations (""Don't back into that dark room alone!!"")  There is nothing particularly ORIGINAL about ""Blar Witch"", although it is an unusual approach and one that is rarely done, let alone done well.<br/><br/>However, the hype surrounding this movie leaves me baffled.  For one, it really hurt to know certain details beforehand (these details have been crammed down our throats via TV and radio for a month or so, now).  There are so few points in the movie where something creepy actually happens, that to know of them before the lights have even gone down strips them of any eeriness.  But more than that, it created expectations for this film which were unrealistic.  Is it a good film?  Yes, if you can technically call it a ""film"".  Is it a GREAT film?  Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>The movie is more creepy to think about than it is scary to watch, and I don't regret seeing it.

"MikeK-9","Null","1","1","11 August 1999"," overhyped, but ending stays with you
","I wish I had not read or heard any of the hype regarding this movie. Unfortunately I knew beforehand how all the creepy stuff was done during the body of the movie (the noises, rocks, etc.), so whenever it happened I knew it was only the directors doing it.  I didn't know about the ending and I still think about it 4 days later.  I agree with those who write that if you are expecting a slasher movie or a Scream type movie then don't bother: You'll find it boring.  I liked the interaction of the characters so the middle of the movie wasn't bad for me.  And that last image of Mike still has me thinking about it. What I don't agree with is this belief that an opinion about a movie is either right or wrong.  For those who think that people who (gasp) didn't like the movie are idiots or unimaginative, the same can be said for you. Have you ever seen a movie that everyone else likes but you?  Does that make you an idiot?  No it just means you have a different opinion.  I also have been seeing reviews which the reviewer gives BWP a good review because its an ""indy"" film or that the budget was only (dollar amount).

"NickW-2","Null","1","1","9 August 1999"," The most eerily disturbing film I've seen in a long while.
","I was just as skeptical about all the hype as many other people--I don't usually put much stock in critics these days.  However, this film very pleasantly surprised me on all levels, especially the acting and almost claustrophobic atmosphere.  First, I want to reiterate one crucial point many here have already stated:  imagination is required!  Granted, I was never utterly terrified or scared out of my wits during this film--I didn't ever jump out of my seat due to sudden fright or surprise (until the very end, anyway).  However, that was the whole idea: to create that uniquely chilling, unsettled feeling in your mind which stays with you throughout the entire film rather than for temporary, cheap shock value.  A lot of reviewers here have said they were disappointed they didn't get to actually see anything; however, I have to ask what exactly were they expecting?! This was never meant to be some big-budget, gore-fest (""Scream"") or flashy visual-effects extravaganza (""The Haunting""); it was meant to play on those most basic and instinctual psychological fears which almost everyone feels at one time or another.  The film lets your imagination and emotions fill in the blanks, and this film accomplished that end brilliantly considering what they had to work with budget-wise.<br/><br/>Even then, it wasn't so much the spooky sounds at night and various phenomenon they discover that disturbed me (though those scenes certainly sent chills down my spine).  Instead it was watching these three characters cope with an extreme situation, terrified out of their minds, and losing hope bit by bit (as does the audience) that they will make it out of their situation alive.  For the last half-hour or so, my heart was beating a mile-minute because I had become so engrossed in the interactions of these characters and what their eventual fates would be.  This aspect of the film is what really made it worthwhile for me.  The claim I've read so often that their behavior in that situation was unrealistic simply baffles me.  It seemed to me their emotions and reactions were perfectly on target considering their situation, despite whatever overacting there may have been at times.  Of course, anyone who picks at such a trivial thing as whether or not they would have kept filming during all this obviously wasn't very interested in the characters or plot to begin with--it's called ""suspension of disbelief""!  Anyway, the acting was, for the most part, excellent, especially Heather and Mike.  I did feel that they went a tad overboard at times with the screaming and yelling, but it still remained well within the bounds of believability (especially after Mike's little revelation--wonderful twist:-)<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was a wonderfully creepy, involving ride which had me riveted from beginning to end (a couple more phrases for those who thought the beginning was boring:  ""foreshadowing"" and ""character development"").  This is one of those rare movies that occupied my mind for days after I saw it and that I definetly plan on seeing again.  It's hard to pick any one moment which creeped me out the most, but I have to say the ending alone was worth the price of admission--that is one image which will never leave my mind!  While I found the apparent fates of these characters disturbing enough, I can understand why some complained that there wasn't any concrete pay-off.  However, I find it strangely fitting:  these three people set out to investigate and possibly reveal the Blair Witch, yet the ambiguous ending merely fuels the myths and legends they started out with."
"Tin Man-5","Null","1","1","9 August 1999"," The SCARIEST movie ever made....and not a single drop of blood.
","I've been reviewing movies for a long time. I'm the Entertainment Editor for a local newspaper, and I've been studying films for a while. I thought I had the whole movie thing pretty much figured out, and I went in to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" thinking, yeah....just another quickie filmed to cash in on the success of ""Scream.""<br/><br/>What I saw defied and challenged everything I have ever known about filmmaking, and quite frankly, it's sending me back to the books to try to figure out just how the heck they managed to pull it off.<br/><br/>This is indeed the scariest, creepiest movie that has ever come out of Hollywood....EVER. Scarier than ""Night of the Living Dead."" Scarier than ""Scream."" Scarier than anything. You name it, I've seen most of them. And they don't hold a candle to this one.<br/><br/>The reason is, there's no monster. No real emphasis of supernatural events. Just three college students trapped in the woods, in a battle with unseen supernatural forces and nature. This alone would have set the stages for a good movie, kind of an interesting play on paranioa. But it takes it a level higher....or maybe a level lower. It's filmed like a documentory, with a camcorder that shakes and moves the whole time. And that leaves it all absolutely nervewracking.<br/><br/>Here's the premise, and it's pretty simple: three college students are out to film a documentory about the Blair Witch, an Urban Legend from the woods of Maryland. But upon a closer examination, they get lost in the woods, and it's basically an account of their struggle, from fleeing from ghostly apparitions in the night to battling with each other. And it's all filmed on a camcorder, and presented like one would present a family vacation that they taped themselves. It's not even in widescreen format....just plain camcorder.<br/><br/>Therefore, it's all realistic, and you question whether or not it is false or ACTUAL footage, due to the authenticity. I was in a cold sweat fifteen minutes into it, and but the terrifying closing scene, I was losing my nerve and trembling violently. Only one other film has come close to having this affect on me....the original ""Candyman""....but it doesn't come anywhere close to this. I knew that film was made up....But this....this challenged fiction and you are absolutely convinced it is real. Kevin Williamson, hate to say it, but you've suddenly been booted into second place by a handful of unprofessionals!<br/><br/>What also helps its realism is the fact that the actors are so great. Most horror movies nowadays have great looking leading teenage actors getting slashed, but this one features normal looking people in terrifying situations. How affective are they? Believe me when I say that Oscar nominations WILL arise.... The character of Heather (an actress playing herself, like her co-stars) has a scene in which she apologizes to the camera for getting her friends into this whole mess. She knows she will die soon, and she is trembling with fear....and it is the finest performance I have ever seen in a horror movie....ever.<br/><br/>Filmed with almost no budget (a budget would have taken away from it), it is choppy and a mess....just like a camcorder recording always is....and that just helps the situation. And this only enhanced the true affect of the film. No film has ever scared me as terribly as this movie.... Go see it only if you think you're strong enough to handle it. Not for the intense gore (there is none), but for the true suspence. This is indeed a horror film that challenges the idea that horror movies need gore, and I totally respect that. That challenge it also sent me screaming, and it will you, as well.<br/><br/>********** out of *****"

I found all of the actors very convincing, and the point-of-view camera work really puts you into the action.  The last sequence, with its chilling final shot, is unequaled in all of movie history.

","Well regardless of what you think of Blair Witch Project you have to admire the buzz it's generated.  I for one loved it - and, like some have already said, you'll either love it or hate it.  During the screening it was interesting to watch the characters interact as they slowly fell apart.  I don't think it was particularly abrupt and it felt natural.  I think the lack of script may have helped to this end.  There were a few spots that felt contrived however (Mike singing the the national anthem?! Cmon!).<br/><br/>Some people are claiming this film rips of this or that but the world's full of less-than-original ideas.  Ferrari is basically building a souped-up ripoff of Ford's Model-T.  I can say the movie for me was unique.  Resist the urge to bail early (which I to some degree had, though not from boredom) and also to judge it the moment the credits roll.  It didn't give me sleeping problems and honestly I could have walked around in the woods after seeing it but once my brain crunched on it for several hours I was left with an unsettled feeling (more so than for any other film in recent memory), that of the hopelessness felt when one is truly lost.<br/><br/>That's scary, that's what I took from the film.  The stuff with the sticks, rocks, etc is secondary and serves the witch premise but honestly who can claim they wouldn't still be panicked if they were lost in the woods, even if there were no noises, sticks, etc.  I don't care if you do have a compass and map or  you're a seasoned backwoodsman, if you're in unfamiliar forest until you stumble on that road something, however small, will gnaw at the back of your mind saying ""what if...""<br/><br/>I remembered as I watched how someone on IMDB early on wrote it was so stupid that most of the audience was ""laughing at it"".  He missed the point, I laughed, we all laughed, simply because the characters were so hopelessly screwed.  To those who wrote ""I'd never have done such-and-such, that's so moronic"" I say panic can induce all kinds of erratic and idiotic behavior. I know when I panic - truly panic - I usually wind up digging a deeper hole for myself to fall into.  Intellect just doesn't come into play.<br/><br/>One more thing.  To those who disregard the warnings of motion sickness BEWARE:  this is worse than anything I've ever encountered.  I can read in the back seat of a car going 80 mph on a winding country road and I NEVER get sick.  About 2/3 the way through this movie I had to cover my closed eyes with my hands to give my stomach a chance to settle.  I missed maybe 10 minutes of movie doing this repeatedly.  I should have gone in pumped up on Dramamine.  The drug should be handed out at the door to the theater and should be mandatory for all viewers."

I hadn't seen a good, disturbing horror since Silence of The Lambs and was openly complaining that they ""just don't make them anymore.""  This film proves me wrong and will surely spawn more suspenseful, occult-based horror wannabes just as Scream spawns the Slasher comeback.  If you liked The Shining, Poltergeist, and Jaws than I recommend Blair Witch.

"Trans-2","8","1","1","8 August 1999"," Objective, comprehensive review of The Blair Witch Project
","Let me start by saying I've seen this movie twice and read at least one hundred user reviews to give me a perspective through other people's eyes. Quickly put, the idea of this movie is a low budget film where the three actors portray student film makers which also substitute as the camerapersons, while the two writer-directors are off eating lunch at Chi-Chi's (its a tough life).  The dialog was all improvised with no real script, except for the two writer-directors leaving general instructions in film canisters at strategic locations in the woods.  The acting was very good, although I don't know if you would call it ""acting"" per se (where everything is predetermined) as opposed to ""guided improvised method acting"" where the actors were more or less living the movie as it was happening (for instance, the writer-directors deliberately diminished their food supplies and made the scary noises at night, for the sake of realism).  For those who were distressed by the lack of a plot, consider that if you ever get lost in the woods, you will probably not have a plot either.<br/><br/>I can see how people would view the acting as either fake or authentic; sometimes the characters seemed to be considerably more horrified of things than they should've been; however, the actual *manner* in which they acted horrified was quite authentic.  This is most true of Heather, the narrator and main protagonist of the film.  I believe the trick to enjoying this movie is to either A) believe the movie really happened, B) believe it is a mockumentary but see the acting as totally believable, or C) believe it is a mockumentary and forgive over-reactions when they occur.  If you fall into categories A or B, you're off to a running start.  If on the other hand you are a C person, to fully appreciate this movie you must willingly suspend your disbelief when Heather over-reacts, and assume that there was something really scary there instead of something not so scary.  I believe this flaw could've been corrected by using, say, blood splattered on the trees or something else which would've more strongly implied imminent violence without actually portraying it; however this would have forsaken the movie's ""no-gore"" concept.  The first time I watched it, I fell into the B category, but the second time I watched it I leaned towards C.  Nevertheless, the movie had even more of an effect on me the second time around.  Without my realizing it, my heart was pounding at the end, and that night my mind was irrationally convinced that the coat-hanger next to my bedroom door was a floating witch guarding the only exit so that I would not be able to escape. This movie flicked a switch somewhere in the back of my mind, convincing me despite my best rational efforts that evil things lurked in the dark recesses of my home.<br/><br/>Another thing that might put unsuspecting viewers off is its differences in production values and approach to horror.  The most obvious are the ones afflicting all low budget movies: no money means unpolished lighting and camera work, cheap sets or costumes, no effects, etc.  One main difference I was pleased with is no score.  We had no music to take us by the hand and tell us when to feel what for who; our reactions to the events were thus more natural, a refreshing change.  The acting was improvised in a mostly relaxed manner, so we were spared the often- excessive melodrama of Hollywood-type productions.  The approach to horror was that of gradually increasing creepiness that gets under your skin, as opposed to ""Look!! I'm a scary monster!!"" and blood-and-guts scares.<br/><br/>Heather bears the most responsibility and delivers the most dialog, sometimes becoming overly talkative as she tries to fill in all silences with narrative commentary.  I was also mildly annoyed at her occasional screech- screaming, but it was realistic and I would've been annoyed if I was there too.  There is also one scene where I really, really, really wanted to hand her a Kleenex.  As for comments about the level of swearing; I'm absolutely sure that neither of the three actors were even aware of their language until prudes pointed it out, since swearing profusely (especially in tense situations) is only natural for people this age.<br/><br/>All in all, I was quite pleased.  I have heard that there are other similar indie productions (Cannibal Holocaust, The Last Broadcast, etc) that were made before this one, which are probably quite envious of this movie's success (this movie as it turns out is making thousands of times its cost in profit).  Despite its qualities and successes, I hope there are no sequels or prequels.  There is speculation as to if it will ignite a ""new"" style of horror film making.  PS: After reading all those other reviews, I have started to wonder... why is it that the entire theater always either ""laughs at the whole movie"" or ""come out scared sh**less""."
"paladin-38","8","1","1","8 August 1999"," This movie is the punk-rock answer to the baroque excesses of a genre grown tired and self-indulgent.
","Within one month of each other, 2 watershed movies have opened that have, each in their own way, done more to shake the hoary old genre of horror movies to its foundations than any movies in decades.<br/><br/>One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects.  The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.<br/><br/>The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely:  it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated.  It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled.  The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into.  And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us:  we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing.<br/><br/>And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead.  It is a movie about redemption.  And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from."

","In July of 1999, two aspiring filmmakers released a low-budget documentary-style horror film into theaters across North America. 87 minutes later, millions are afraid of the forest.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is supported by an absolutely ingenious concept: three college students set out to shoot a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend, and are never seen alive again. Well, not if you count the chilling peek the audience gets into their final days in the form of the footage shot by the filmmakers, as we watch with mounting suspense as they near their fates.<br/><br/>What is so frightening about ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not what we do see in the end but what we don't. So abstract are the final minutes of film that the imagination of the audience is forced to take over, and that is the stuff that sleepless nights are made of.<br/><br/>I can't guarantee that everyone will be scared or even amused by ""Blair,"" but I can tell you that I am not easily scared by a film, and this movie spooked me more than anything I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to people with an open mind and an appreciation for inventive filmmaking."
"ghoul-3","Null","1","1","8 July 1999"," Oh the hype...the hype!
","I was looking forward to this evening like nothing I can remember. Myself and three friends were about to have the privilege of seeing a private screening of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" supposedly, and based on dozens of reviews, ""the scariest movie in a long time, if not the scariest movie ever made period."" I had read nearly 100 reviews of this film, from novice critics to established professionals, and all but about 7 declared ""Blair Witch"" to be a truly unsettling terrifying film experience.<br/><br/>I am 44 years old...have grown up with horror movies...loved horror movies since I was six...been part of horror movies...wrote and directed a documentary about what is probably the BEST horror movie ever...and have been a radio, newspaper and magazine film critic since 1980. Needless to say I know what a good horror movie is..should be...and was nervously looking forward to having the living hell scared out of me.<br/><br/>We waited until complete dark, then ran ""Blair Witch Project"" at 11:30 PM. 87 MInutes later we all sat around and stared at each other unable to speak. Finally I said it first ""uh...is that the same film we've heard so much about?...because if it is...I want to know what was supposed to be so scary...so terrifying...so creepy about it. For the next hour or so we analyzed and scrutinized ""Blair Witch,"" offering what we thought was good and the overpowering majority of what was bad.<br/><br/>We all agreed that it was an interesting idea, although heavily borrowed from ""Cannibal Holocaust."" We thought the 'you are there' style was good and the performances of the unknown leads was mostly very good.<br/><br/>The basic plot has a group of filmmakers, headed up by a loud-mouth bossy lady 'el direktor,' heading out to do a documentary on the legendary Blair witch that supposedly still haunts a certain area in Maryland. After interviewing some locals, and listening to some fairly creepy stories, the kids head into the very same 'haunted' woods to do some filming, video-taping and audio recording. Daytime is spent yelling, cussing and getting more and more lost. Night time is filled with sudden awakenings to creepy sounds and voices. Of course the camera and mike goes on every time to 'capture' this spooky stuff...and we know that things are only going to get worse for these movie makers. The movie history tells us that the group came up missing and all that was found was footage and audio tapes. The movie is an edited version of what was recovered. I'll stop right here with the description.<br/><br/>We all contended that a few elements were indeed creepy...but what was intended to be oh-so-scary was pretty banal when you got right down to it. You turn a light on and shine it in any part of the woods late at night and you'll get the creeps. If all around you are eerie voices and footsteps, you get the hell out of there, you don't run holding a heavy camera and keep on filming. That's done in ""Blair Witch Project"" more than once and it's simply silly and downright unbelievable, marring the 'supposed' REAL terror engulfing these people.<br/><br/>Admittedly the final twenty minutes of ""Blair Witch Project"" gets intense with the promise of something truly nightmarish to come. It never happens. The movie has no end..no explanation of any kind. The final image on the screen is puzzling and frustratingly vague but not provocative.<br/><br/>I fully agree that psychological terror is great and the more that is left to the imagination...the better...but ""Blair Witch Project"" leaves so much to the imagination, coupled with what is obviously improvisational 'play acting' and numerous contrivances, that it just doesn't work nearly as well as it should have, although the potential was certainly there. At a time when horror films are pretty much overrated teen-oriented soundtrack selling 'crap,' it would have been nice to have something original and frightening. I'm still waiting. ""Blair Witch Project"" is not that film and it doesn't come close to living up to all the hype.<br/><br/>We agreed that if we hadn't heard anything at all about this film in advance, at best it would be regarded as a direct-to-video film with an interesting concept that produces a few chills and tense moments, but nothing profound or overly effective. Keep in my mind, this is my opinion, and the opinions of my movie-loving buddies. If ""Blair Witch Project"" scared the hell out of you and you love it...great. You have a right to your opinion as well. Although I'm glad I got to see it, and I will probably see it more than once, it remains an interesting over-hyped colossal disappointment. On a 1-100 scale: 68."
"buffy-34","Null","1","1","9 August 1999"," Creepy, so creepy
","This is not a horror movie about gore, despite the title it isn't even about the Blair Witch after their second day of filming. It's creepy because it deals with raw human emotion, paranoia that sets in after you can't take being scared anymore, people so afraid for their lives that the slightest crack of a twig sends the into a babbling rampage. This movie feels real, and that's why it's creepy.<br/><br/>I've read some comments here and I'm very surprised at other's ignorance. This movie is not supposed to be 35mm quality. It's supposed to look like 3 college students running through the woods with a camera turned on. Yes it's going to be shaky. It's supposed to look like a documentary, and it does. The scary part is not supposed to be the Blair Witch, so don't get disappointed when you don't see her. The movie is about the emotions and fears of the three students who desperately try to find there way out of the myriad of trees. Anyone who finds this movie dumb because it doesn't make you jump out of your seat, you don't get to see the Blair Witch, because it was shot on video, or just because you say it's dumb for these people to be running through the woods yelling for each other, I feel very sorry for you. Your ignorance has prevented your mind from realizing how truly creepy it is.<br/><br/>So much credit has to go to these actors. They all did such great jobs on conveying what it's really like to be scared to death. Their paranoia and hysteria added to the freakiness this film already had. I can only hope movie rolls come in quickly to these three. Hollywood could use a few more really talented people.<br/><br/>Finally, the last 10 minutes of the movie will forever be etched in my mind. Try going to sleep after seeing that. I know it took me forever just to be able to close my eyes last night!"

While this movie will not scare you out of your seat, it will make you restless on your next trip to the woods. The interaction between the characters is great. It really seems as if this is a home movie. Nothing seems contrived. To really enjoy the movie, you must get into the characters and their situation. Nothing jumps out of the shadows with a knife and a mask, so their fright is all in their minds, or is it. You are left guessing, even after the movie. This gets my highest possible recommendation."

","Three filmmakers go to the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a mysterious local legend but what they discover in the reenacted film, ""The Blair Witch Project"", is much more tragic than they could imagine.  This is a unique and terrifying film in which all that we see comes through the lens of two cameras that the three bring along - one, 16 mm black and white, for the documentary and the other, full video color, as a tag-along. This depiction is already spooky enough because the audience becomes voyeurs through the eyes and senses of these filmmakers; indeed, they accurately reflect upon this technique as a sort of filtered reality'. Therefore, we see a blending of the images of the two cameras which, while sequential in time, comes across as choppy rather than continuous because they decide when the camera should be turned on and when it should be off. This adds to the heightened suspense as the three people get totally lost in the forest and we never get a full picture of what is confronting them because our vantage point has been micro-sized to their level.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is challenging, tricky filmmaking but it works because it is one of the few times in cinema that you can feel and experience what the participants are experiencing that very moment.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Heather, looks into the camera and poignantly apologizes to each of the three mothers about how sorry she is in getting them all involved in a tragedy that she well senses.  That is a particularly powerful message about taking responsibility for one's actions.  For me, the appeal of ""The Blair Witch Project"" goes beyond the chills and frights of a brilliantly conceived form of cinematography.  It boils down to accepting failure as a necessary part of life, however tragic and final that might be."

That would be just fine and dandy ... except the movie certainly doesn't live up to that expectation.

","Three teenagers disappear in the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland whilst filming a documentary about the legend of the ""Blair Witch"". A year later their footage is found.<br/><br/>It's hard to know how to review this film, because the only reason it was thought to be so unbelievably scary is the great advertising idea advertise it as if it was real! If I had watched it believing it was real, I would have been freakin terrified. I would have felt the terror of the actors; I would have felt the frustration and the anger; I would have heard every tiny noise they heard and I'd have probably been hoping that they got out there alive, even though I knew they had been missing for a year, so it wasn't really likely and I would have loved (well, be left wondering by) the ending! <br/><br/>But I didn't. I saw it knowing it was false and I felt.. not much. From the beginning the characters were already annoying me, and they just got worse as the film went so it was hard to feel anything for them; I laughed in disbelief at the ridiculous things they did (One of them purposefully kicked the map into the river when they were already lost (???)); and the repetition of them running around the woods screaming at each other and then sitting in the tents terrified of the noises they could hear outside, yet still trying to capture what it was on film, got a little tiring.<br/><br/>And then there is the famous ending not so great after all! But again, would have been effective if you believed it. <br/><br/>The only thing that still works though is the use of the idea that it's scarier when you can't see what is out there. This was used to good effect... up to a point. There are a lot of shots where it's all just pitch black and all you can hear is their frantic whispering about what the hell it is that is out there, or, in some cases, just silence and you're just waiting to see if something passes by, but this is used to often and it got too routine by the end.<br/><br/>And I have to say I loved the hand held camera style of filming, very effective and I have to give credit to the actors they were great!

Horror films that tap into our hard-wired instinctive fears probe a deeper place than movies with more sophisticated threats. A villain is only an actor, but a shark is more than a shark.""<br/><br/>And that is what make The Blair Witch Project so effective. It depends on the sounds of nature that would scare you at night. It is what should really scare you in life. It does not use scary Psycho music(I mean, that's a good movie, but you know when she will die in the shower!), or other warnings. it just let's it happen.<br/><br/>And the the most scariest thing is how many times they say the F word!<br/><br/>If you want a truly scary movie, look no further than this!"

I didn't know what the story was, but just the sounds, images, and EXTREMELY convincing acting was enough to make my hair stand up on end. A few years later I watched it for the first time and had trouble falling asleep for about 2 weeks after wards, and I definitely didn't wanna go camping! <br/><br/>So many friends have asked me why I think it's scary. I always hear ""It doesn't show us anything!"" ""You never even see the witch!"" Well... they just answered their own question. You never see the witch, or anything for that matter. Everything is left to your imagination. You don't know whether or not these kids are really being haunted by something, or if they're all simply losing their minds. That is real suspense. You can't re-create that feeling with bloody makeup and monster masks. The other huge factor that went into my fear for this movie was the marketing. As a kid, I genuinely believed it was real ""footage"" that was found in the woods. The actors are so convincing in their roles that it sucks you right in.<br/><br/>Everyone is going to have their opinion. Some people have certain standards for their horror films, and The Blair Witch Project might not meet some of those standards.

Although the movie isn't very good and it just seems to have gotten a cult following because they went in a realistic direction. Where it seems like the incident with the students and the Blair Witch really happened, but besides that there is nothing really good about this. I am sure the creators of this film is really happy to receive other people's hard earned money for a below mediocre movie such as this. Maybe they thought the incident really happened and was entertained by that one factor. And since the creators made this with a shoestring budget, and ended up getting back way more than they invested on it. I think my favorite part of the movie though is when all three students end up getting killed by the witch cause I hated everyone in this and leading some viewers to really overrate this, there just isn't anything that will make the audience feel threatened. And I ain't saying that cause the film hardly has any violence in it, most of this movie's run time is taken up with three idiots running around screaming over half the time. I give it some props for leading some viewers as if this is something real with it's marketing.

","I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out. There was nothing terrifying or suspenseful about it to me, and I am someone who likes genuinely suspenseful movies. (Note: I do not like the gratuitous fake-blood-using horror flicks that just come off as laughable, but rather truly suspenseful films that keep you hooked and feeling ""freaked out"" and guessing throughout the film.) This movie promised to be a classic suspense film, not a bloody horror show, but it was actually neither. The only suspense in it was waiting for something interesting to happen. By the time the ending credits rolled, I realized nothing interesting would happen. My husband and I both looked at each other and said, ""This is it?"" If you want a more mind-bending, suspense thriller, I suggest Identity, starring John Cusack or any classic Hitchcock thriller. Even at his worst, Hitchcock had great cinematography and an artistry to his work unparalleled by the likes of Blair Witch."

","The Blair Witch Project manages to do something that few movies have ever done for me, scare me. In a world where studio's think that hyper stylized, CGI filled mosters are the only way for audiences to be scared, the blair witch project finds terror in the haunted woods of our own imagination. The movie builds subtly (a pile of rocks outside the tent, loud nosies in the dark, mysterious stick figures) but through this seemingly vague approach, the audience is allowed to conjure up monsters far more terrifying than anything Hollywood could manufacture. the movies also does a terrific job of creating an aura of despair. most effectively though, the movie plays on our own primal fears and that is what truly makes it one of the best horror movies i have seen."

It was un-watched for about 2 weeks then someone spread the rumor that is was a true story of amateur film students who found a real witch. All of a sudden people started watching it.<br/><br/>I think it is one of the first movies to become famous via internet. Of course there are a lot of ""film students"" who love the idea of this movie that gives them hope of one day duping the public in the same way and making some money for a crappy film.<br/><br/>In reality it was not a true story, because even really stupid people could not do the moronic things these ""educated college students"" did. But it was different, full of amateur acting and amateur shooting, and writing so bad I wonder if a script even existed. The story moved way too slow, and did not have enough clarity to keep you in suspense. But the worst part about this was the filming, the camera hoping up and down is almost enough to make you sea sick.<br/><br/>Really what kind of idiots go investigate a ""witch"" with NO GPS, NO real Map or compass. Oh and no phone or emergency radio?...geez.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare things like Pet Rocks that gets unexpectedly hyped up, reaches a point that everyone says hey I got to see that.

","This movie was a brilliant marketing gimmick. I give the gimmick a 10. I actually knew people who bought that it was based on a true story, that the footage was real. And for these people, the movie must have been terrifying. There's a difference between a real documentary and a fake one, and this looked almost like the real thing. But we forgive a real documentary for shoddy camera-work, boring dialogue, etc, because it's real. And if anything compelling had happened here, I would have forgiven this movie for those same faults too. But...<br/><br/>A brilliant movie it was not. It was, in fact, a terrible movie. The filmmakers just tried too hard to make it look real. As a result, we do get some decent acting, but if you're looking for a real plot, look elsewhere. The story just rambles along at an extremely slow pace. We get mysteries throughout, and a few minor shudders, and there was a spookiness to the cinematography, but the way it was shot was just too claustrophobic to be compelling. As far as the story, it was basically a standard ""kids lost in the woods"" movie with all the clichés attached. They lose the map! They're going around in circles! Ooh, there are scary things happening outside the tent while they're sleeping! And those weird twig things! By the end of the movie, we're hungry for some kind of explanation as to what is going on. We never get it. What we get is an extremely cryptic ending that is too esoteric to make sense. I thought the sequel was supposed to explain what was going on?!? The sequel just went in a completely different direction, and it didn't make any sense either! By the way, I thought this was supposed to be a trilogy. Where's the third movie? Like I said, the acting isn't bad, but it's not great either; they actually look like film students doing a bad student film. The dialogue is awful. The movie is boring. And it doesn't make any sense. I think a lot of people were lulled in by that cutting-edge marketing gimmick, and maybe ended up confusing the gimmick for the movie itself. That's the only explanation I can see for people liking this movie. In my opinion, it was a con, and should have been a bomb. Instead, it was one of the most successful independent movies of all time, and because no real care went into the making, possibly the most profitable. I'm not going to down you if you liked this movie; I felt like I wasted my time watching it, and would have actually been angry if I had paid to see it in the theater."
"squeezebox","Null","3","6","16 June 2003"," Superb, one of the best horror movies of the 90's
","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT wound up the unfortunate victim of self-canibalization.  Artisan relentlessly marketed and merchandised what should have remained a creepy little curiosity destined for cult obscurity. While it made the company millions of dollars, the non-stop BLAIR WITCH hubbub destroyed the movie's staying power, at least with a wide audience.<br/><br/>But maybe this movie should never have been seen by a wide audience.  Maybe the movie's advertising should have been word-of-mouth driven ONLY.  Maybe this movie should have never been released theatrically, at least not on a large scale.  Trying to appeal to a generation whose idea of horror is SCREAM, when the product you are selling is more along the lines of grittier horrors such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, is destined to ultimately fail.  Artisan may have made a killing, but they killed the movie in the process.<br/><br/>BLAIR WITCH is one of the few movies I can think of that works better on the small screen.  When watching a grainy underground movie on TV, one feels they are seeing something subversive and taboo.  Seeing the very same thing on the big screen comes off as overly stylized, cinema-verite gone wild. This is largely due to the overuse of hand-held photography in commercials and on MTV--the very audience of which is whom BLAIR WITCH was directed toward.<br/><br/>Now, mention THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and you'll hear, ""It sucked,"" ""It wasn't scary,"" ""Heather Donohue is an annoying bitch,"" ""The camera work was terrible,"" ""It was boring,"" ""I'm sick of it.""<br/><br/>The last comment is the only one with any degree of validity.<br/><br/>Anyone who did not find this movie even the least bit intense or eerie went into it determined to not let it affect them.  As far as the ridiculous criticism of Donohue's performance, her CHARACTER was indeed an annoying bitch.  She was obnoxious, loud, pushy and irritating.  In other words, her performance was perfect.<br/><br/>Perhaps the dumbest of all the backlash against this movie were complaints about the shaky camerawork.  You see, it's really hard to sprint through the woods over uneven ground and retain a steady frame--especially when you may have forgotten you were even carrying a camera!  Found documentary footage is rarely very steady or polished, especially when it comes from the cameras of people being pursued by ghosts in the woods.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is a solid, creepy, intense, suspensful, entertaining thriller.  It moves along at a swift pace and manages a sense of anxiety rarely captured in American cinema, even during the early humorous scenes.  It's terror works much in the same way as David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME or Gasper Noe's IRREVERSIBLE--we know, to some extent, the protagonists fate at the beginning of the movie, so the entire story has a sense of dread and doom about it.<br/><br/>I loved this movie.  Loved it.  There's nothing to read into it, nothing to figure out, nothing to ponder over.  It is what it is.  A good, scary shriek show.  They're a dying breed these days."

I've seen episodes of Scooby Doo that were scarier,  & pornos that had better plots & character development. If you want to see a truly disturbing psychological horror film, watch Repulsion or Peeping Tom. If you want to see a scary supernatural film with innovative cinematography, rent Suspiria or Kwaidan.

","Why do people find this movie scary and others do not?  Having spent many of my years watching all sorts of horror movies, I can say that this movie is very eerie and scary, even more so than most of the movies from the last two decades.<br/><br/>First off, the propaganda around the movie sets up that these events really happened, so people see the movie the way many would have watched the OJ trial or the JFK assassination...they weren't there for a movie, they went to see a documentary, so they were a bit freaked to begin with.  It also helped the realism along that it was filmed by the actors on video cameras.<br/><br/>Plus, they never show you the Blair Witch, and folks, that's spook genius right there.  Rent any number of Alfred Hitchcock's films, and you may see a parallel.  What you don't see will scare you more than what you do see. When we watch a Jason or Freddy movie, we are relieved when they come on screen, because we can stay in that ""it's a movie mindset.""  But by not seeing the witch, you mind can't find that mindset as easily, leaving it to your imagination, which can raise your pulse just a little more than normal.<br/><br/>And yes, the movie is slow, but that's part of the whole point.  It builds to the climax we see at the end, taking us on a ramp of anxiety, rather than the up and down formula of a slasher movie.  Boring? At first, yes.  Dull? Only if you aren't paying attention...<br/><br/>Take it for what you will, I see a great addition to the horror genre.  And whether you love this movie or hate it, you must admit that there are certainly fewer people going camping nowadays."

Strange occurrences and loud nights cause the three to slowly go crazy and their safety becomes a major concern as the clock ticks. Could the myth really be a reality? ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of those films that will be copied and copied by hacks for years to come. This will all cause many to forget how creative and truly original this film is. The documentary style and the clever advertising campaign led many to believe that this was in fact reality. The craze was on par with that of ""The Exorcist"" for a short time in 1999.

I grant you it's a great use of the budget', but so what? If I came across this on late night channel 4, I would have thought O.K student film. Annoying but has potential'. When it is putting itself up with the big boys it gets judged on its comparative merits. Which are very few. I was glad all three protagonists were murdered. I had so little sympathy for their whiny antics I felt like doing it myself. The acting was lame (But it was a low budget'. So what?

When Blair Witch mania hit I had every student and wannabe film critic telling me I had to see it' The indie film of the century' this'll show the big studios'. My personal backlash was so savage I couldn't have a conversation with anyone about it without shouting Your wrong! Its rubbish and you are stupid!'. But now I am calmer.

","The Blair Witch Project is a crude, vulgar attempt to capitalize on Generation X's fascination with itself. Completely devoid of content and purpose, this is the film to watch when you have no stereotypically shallow teenagers around to swear at you and talk about getting drunk or stoned. It will fill that void for 90 minutes, while subtly creating a greater void in your appreciation of art that may haunt you for the rest of your life. Yes, this film terrified me, but not because it was a frightening horror film. It is an archetypical example of big business (in this case Artisan Entertainment) manufacturing social reality for profit. And that is truly terrifying.<br/><br/>I can only recommend The Blair Witch Project to psychologists and others who study the manufacture of social reality (research Artisan's marketing campaign first or you'll likely find the film itself excruciatingly tedious). In this regard alone does The Blair Witch Project offer any significance. May it quickly be forgotten, and may big business and government never learn the lessons it teaches."

"Desslok","Null","3","6","10 June 2001"," Oh the humanity!
","First - I've been traumatized by every horror movie in the book. From Friday the 13th to Psycho, I've seen 'em all. That's why I was suckered into seeing this stinking pile of refuse laughingly called a movie. I was intrigued by the press the movie was getting, and it sounded like an interesting premise.<br/><br/>An hour and a half later, I was disgusted that I had paid 7 bucks for this train wreck. No - even worse, I had paid the highest price of them all: two hours of my life savagely ripped away from me that I will never get back.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the line, film goes have mistaken two hours of people on screen swearing at each other at the top of their lungs as character development, and running around in the woods non-stop as a plot. Half an hour of set up - and then an hour and a half of nothing - and then, the shock ending - where nothing happens. Have people's sensibilities been degraded by modern culture that they find this enjoyable?<br/><br/>
No monster/witch at the end. No pay-off whatsoever, at all - zip, nada, zilch! Now, I by no means have to have a full blown million dollar CGI special effect to scare the ever-lovin crap out of me. In fact, less is more - the most scary movies I can think of are where they never show, they simply suggest. However, the viewer needs **SOMETHING** to hang their hats on - a fleeting shadow of a great white shark under the water, a dripping claw on the Nostromo, a long shot of a man in a black jumpsuit in Haddonfield - something. What does the Blair Witch do? Make scary noises in the woods at night. Ooooh - hold me! Oh - and don't forget about those scary sticks and piles of rocks? I find scarier things in my breakfast cereal.<br/><br/>
Horror movies are frequently known for their plots - or lack of. Most of the time, this is true - a generic slasher flick often is a string of events loosely held together by a vague narrative. In the right mood, this can be even kind of fun, in a cheesy sort of way. However, the most cookie cutter Friday the 13th movie has more going for it in the coherent narrative department than this amateur attempt does. I was hoping for something more than ""Kids go into the woods to make a movie, kids get lost, kids run around for several days, kids die."" What the hell is that?!?<br/><br/>After seeing the film, the next day at work  I was going off about it - and was instructed to go to blairwitch.com for the full back story. Surprise, surprise - guess what! There was indeed a full history on the legend, write ups on the characters, and more background information that I could hope for. If the creative (sic) team did all this work, then WHY THE HELL WAS NONE OF IT IN THE MOVIE?!?!? A viewer should not have to go do homework to get the complete story.<br/><br/>Illogical plot devices abound. They get lost in the wood because ""I threw the f'ing map away, you stupid &!^@#^"" - a plot crowbar if I've ever seen one. Or how about ignoring common sense - even I, a city boy to the core, would know that if you follow a river downstream, you will eventually wind up SOMEWHERE! Anywhere - a road, a farm, the freakin' ocean, for god sake! Yet this simple concept eludes the characters (and I use the term 'characters' very loosely.). Or - the best one yet: if I woke up in the middle of the night, with the forces of evil shaking my tent like Lucifer himself was outside, I sure as hell would **NOT** grab my camera and keep filming as I ran. I would haul ass as fast as my legs would go - buck naked if need be. Yet they have the presence of mind to keep the film rolling? And what about that survival book that the filmmakers take great pains to point out in the beginning of the movie - and yet never shows up again?<br/><br/>(Note to the creative (sic) team - next time, don't just make the movie up as you go. Take some time and formulate a dialogue and a story - maybe even write a script. I know it's a bold concept in this modern day and age, but your viewers will thank you for it.)<br/><br/>For those of you who seem to have forgotten what a *truly* frightening and/or movie is, let me bring you up to speed on required viewing: Exorcist (the creepiest movie ever), Jaws (a film that traumatizes an ENTIRE generation of people, keeping them off the beach for years, has something going for it), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining, Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Ring (a classic Japanese horror film proving that terror is not exclusive to North America), Alien, and of course the granddaddy of them all - Psycho. Of course, all the sad people who have bought into the hype of the movie will call me closed minded and an idiot for not falling to my knees and worshipping this movie. Fine - whatever. I'll just be over here watching<br/><br/>Bottom line - do not be suckered in by this movie. Go rent a good horror flick instead - you'll thank me for it."

WHAT WAS THAT CRAP!!  Scary? What? Are you people all retarded??!!  There is absolutely nothing redeeming about Blair Witch, nothing!  It's isn't even worth another viewing for it's camp value, because it isn't even campy! Just what, may I ask, was so damn scary about it?  Was it the terrible camera work, the absence of logic?  The feeling of confusion and nausea? Was it the narcotic-induced panic of the 3 imbiscilic film students?  This is quite simply THE WORST movie I have EVER seen in my life!  Stay away, stay far away!"
"Buddy-51","9","3","6","11 November 1999"," creepy and original horror film
","""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeds where so many horror films fail because of the sheer simplicity of its conception and design, allowing it to tap far more deeply into a wide range of primal fears than the conventional ""fright"" films churned out regularly by major Hollywood studios.  While the latter films tend to dilute their terror through overplotting, over production and over reliance on special effects, ""The Blair Witch Project"" eschews all that for creativity, visual inventiveness and an admirable conviction that what is left unseen is often more terrifying than what is visualized.<br/><br/>The film presents itself cleverly as a pseudodocumentary tale of a group of fictional college students who become lost in the woods while endeavoring to film a study of a local scary legend.  With this structure, the film creepily conjures up many of the basic anxieties and dreads humans are prone to such as fear of the dark, of being hopelessly lost in an isolated environment, of unidentifiable noises on which one can project one's greatest terrors, of total loss of control against an unknown and malevolent force.<br/><br/>Even more impressive is the way the film expands to become a study of the human psyche when it is placed into a situation of unspeakable fear and desperation.  As the characters begin to grasp the gravity of their situation, the forced jocularity begins to be stripped away revealing the childlike terror, guilt, need for recrimination and eventually despair and hopelessness that overtake them.  The actors are brilliant in capturing the full gamut of emotions these characters must go through before the preordained tragic end.  The film also provides a slyly satirical spin on the obsessively cinematic tone of modern life, wherein every event must be captured on film or videotape, so much so that, even as death is breathing down the necks of these characters, the cameras continue to roll to record it.  As one of them says in justification,  ""That's all I have left.""  That is her piece of the comfortable world of familiarity that helps her, at least momentarily (if futiley), evade the harsh reality of her situation. Also, these characters pay a high price for the superior tone of cavalier indifference and almost mockery they display towards the tales of the legend they have come to ""investigate.""<br/><br/>More than any horror film of recent memory, ""The Blair Witch Project"" gets under the viewer's skin and gives one that feeling of creepy vulnerability that only the best horror films can do."

","I generally tend to like low budget movies, they have to rely more heavily on the script and acting than the big budget movies. So after hearing some good things about it I saw the movie on a friday evening.... and I have to say that the movie has one good feature: it's only 80 minutes you have to wait for it to end. All the people that I could overhear afterwards were telling each other how much they disliked this movie. You can compare this movie with the standard highschool horror movies, its only much worse and it adds nothing to the genre at all. Don't be misguided by people who say this all is ok because its art. It is not.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch project has it all: bad script, bad acting, bad camera work.<br/><br/>

"ekotan","1","3","6","30 October 1999"," A triumph of hype and marketing
","This was truly the worst film I've seen in a long, long time; and definitely the worst film I've ever seen in a cinema. ""Spawn"" had better acting. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" had better special effects. ""Police Academy V"" had more coherent direction. And ""10,000 Years BC"" had a better script. Perhaps I can excuse the lack of anything like a script, direction, acting, etc. that might qualify it as ""a movie"". After all, it was shot by amateurs who never dreamed it would get widespread cinema release, never mind this high a profile. What I can't excuse is the complete lack of entertainment value. Any good movie must have a good story to tell, with characters the audience cares about. ""Blair Witch"" has neither. There is no plot to spoil, and the three characters are equally whiny and annoying. There are also huge gaping holes in the plot, but I won't mention these now as they've been discussed to death in Usenet.<br/><br/>I wanted to walk out several times, but I just had to watch it til the end to see what all the fuss was about, and in case some miracle happens at the end to make it worthwhile. It didn't. It was pathetically naff. It was so bad I've seen better home movies about family holidays in Crete. I guess this film is the biggest testament to the power of media hype and guerilla marketing, and I respect that. But boy, did it stink. At the end of it all, some people in the theatre were furious. Some even demanded their money back from the box office, something unheard of in my experience!<br/><br/>Critics are raving about how this was made on only $50,000. My point of view is, what a waste of $50K. And I wonder what it was spent on? I agree with Chris Rock's verdict: I swear there's gotta be someone out there walking around with $49,500 dollars in his pocket. It was boring, pointless, irritating and a waste of time.<br/><br/>Despite this, if you are in any doubt about whether to go see this movie, I recommend that you DO. There is no other way to truly ascertain how awful this film really is, because you've read all the good reviews, and you've been exposed to the hype, therefore you wouldn't believe me now when I'm saying this film is terrible, in however many ways I put it. *I* wouldn't have believed me, if I hadn't seen it for myself. Given that I've just recommended it to you, despite my hating it, it should go to show just how it got its profits.<br/><br/>Some UK critics are hailing it as the scariest movie of all time. Comparisons to horror classics like ""The Exorcist"", ""Alien"", and ""Jaws"" are already being made. Please let them be kidding, I've seen scarier hamburgers. And they were far more entertaining to watch."

","I'm afraid I don't understand the wide appeal that this movie has generated. Having heard both good and bad things about it, I didn't know what to expect when I finally watched it.  I should have saved my money.  This movie basically drops three obnoxious film students into the woods under the premise that they are going to solve the mystery of the legendary Blair witch.  Heather, the only female in the group, was loud, obnoxious and very pushy-her major talent seemed to be screaming at the top of her lungs every time she heard a twig snap.  The other two, particularly Josh, seem to be little more than stoners whose primary preoccupations are with smoking cigarettes and using one particularly charming expletive repeatedly.<br/><br/>I felt that the entire movie was setting the scene for something, but it never delivered.  It was merely three fools running in the woods screaming, then it ended.  Thank God."

","What constitutes horror?  Many people say it's blood and guts (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and so on).  Others say it's movies that mess with your mind (The Shining,), and others will say it's how much a movie startles you and makes you jump to the ceiling (can't think of one off hand).<br/><br/>But real horror, is the type we cannot see.  It's the type that we leave to our imagination because we know that there could be any number of possibilites, and some of those can be so horrific, it gives you chills just thinking about it.  As is the case with The Blair Witch Project.  I saw the film in a packed movie theater and I've never seen a film captivate a group of people this big the way it did.  I'm talking about that everyone in the place was dead freakin' silent.  My heart was up into my throat by the time the movie ended.  I didn't jump, I didn't get grossed out, I just thought about the movie for hours after seeing it, and didn't sleep well at all that night.  Any horror movie that scares the living daylights out of me the way The Blair Witch Project did, is an absolute 10 in my book.  It's like not wanting to ride the rollercoaster, and then riding it and then saying you want to go on again.<br/><br/>Take dramamime before seeing it, or if not, just look away from the screen every so often because the herky-jerky home video style filming will make you a bit queasy.  This movie deserves several mentions at the Academy Awards.  If not, then chalk up another injustice in the film industry.  If you happen to wait for home video to watch this, turn the lights off, and watch it by yourself.  The full effect of this masterpiece will be felt all the more."

"mrb0775","1","5","13","8 September 2019"," Fraudulent Movie Reviews Conned People Into Paying Money To See This Crap!
","In the summer of 1999, after reading a couple over zealous (to say the least) film reviews, which heaped much praise on ""The Blair Witch Project"", while helping to bring more public attention to the flick, such publicity, unfortunately, led my wife and I to become victims of being suckered into wasting some of our hard earned money to buy tickets to one of the top frauds ever pulled on unwary moviegoers.<br/><br/>Certainly, low budget horror films, such as the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"", to give just 2 examples, have proven that genuine chills and suspense can be generated by some very modestly produced film efforts. But for my Mrs and I, the only reactions that ""Blair Witch"" was able to create in us were tedium, as well as my wife becoming nauseous from the constantly jerky camera movement, which was the major defining feature of the movie's purely amateurish photography. I wouldn't dignify that ""camerawork"" by calling it cinematography.<br/><br/>Some people who tend to overrate ""Blair Witch"", try to claim that in order for audience members to be able to perceive the supposedly authentic horror and terror of the flick, those viewers must be able to effectively use their own imaginations to fully appreciate the film. But that's just pure BS, folks! Because with ""Blair Witch's"" middle school level of overacting, and its crude photographic technique, in order for my imagination (which is quite good) to really succeed at helping the movie create an actual sense of terror, I'd have to work as hard at exercising my imagination, as would be required for me imagining that Megan Fox is actually treating me to some nice oral sex, right now!<br/><br/>BTW, without me presenting any specific spoilers here, let me quote an actually HONEST professional review of ""The Blair Witch Project"" that comes directly from the 1651 page ""2007 DVD & Video Guide"", by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter.
Here's their entire capsule review of ""The Blair Witch Project"", as it appears on page 114 of that handy & informative volume, about movies available on video.
""A fiendishly clever publicity campaign fueled the release of this ultra-low budget quickie, which turned out to be one of the biggest swindles ever perpetrated on unsuspecting movie audiences. This ""faux documentary"" about three young filmmakers who meet an uncertain fate while investigating an old legend in the Maryland woods, fails to deliver, on all counts.""<br/><br/>So, as many readers will have already surmised, from the description of ""The Blair Witch Project"", provided in that DVD/movie guide, the authors of that book gave ""Blair Witch"" their LOWEST rating, which is their classification of TURKEY, that's reserved for really poor movies. And honestly, if IMDb's ratings included a ZERO STAR rating, that's precisely what I'd assign to crap like ""The Blair Witch Project""!!"
"enniodog","Null","5","13","17 July 1999"," Original, yes, but WAY over-hyped
","I concede that 'The Blair Witch Project' is one the most original horror movies in modern cinema, yes, and that it is completely worthy of praise. What I can not understand though, is the overwhelming plethora of critical gushings such as that from 'Mr. Showbiz' calling it ""the scariest movie ever made.""  Does the distributor Artisan Films have these people on the payroll??<br/><br/>Sans the thought-provoking conclusion I never got the sense of sheer terror I've experienced in such horror-fare as 'Halloween' or 'The Shining.'  One ostensible source of the audiences' sense of doom in this film comes from the fact that the 3 documentarians can't find their way out of the Maryland woods and somehow every step leads them to where they were days before. Their surroundings begin to look alike.  This would normally be effective in underground catacombs or in a haunted house where an evil force could conceivably manipulate the environment, but if you're in the woods there are some subtle clues which can be used to ensure you're not going in circles. Did it ever enter these peoples' minds to, say, oh I don't know, FOLLOW THE STREAM or USE THE SUN??<br/><br/>I shouldn't be too harsh even though it's probably too late.  Given their $30,000 budget the filmmakers have created quite an achievement (the premise alone was brilliant) and given this economic allowance, the film is impressive.  On a Sundance level I understand the excitement, but to say this ranks up there with the best of all time?  I don't think so.  Let's praise this for its originality and creativity.  Not its ability to scare us."

Bad acting, horrible camera work (OK, it is supposed to look authentic, but even by documentary standards it is bad), a story line that fits under a closed door and none-existing narration.<br/><br/>I cannot think of one redeeming feature that makes the `Blair Witch' worth watching.<br/><br/>I noted the `suspense' and `innovative plot' remarks in other user's comments.<br/><br/>Actually, while I appreciate other people's opinions, I personally don't even begin to understand where they are coming from.<br/><br/>For example - what was spooky, frightening or suspenseful about this movie???<br/><br/>OK - I've been in the Army and spent time deep in the bush . not just in a park like setting like the `Blair Witch' guys were strolling through. I have seen more frightening and intimidating things on Army training grounds like what's pictured in the movie. Does anyone really think that `witch' thing was frightening??? Well, I hope they never meet a drill sergeant in their lives . especially not in a forest!!!<br/><br/>Also, how could these guys possibly get lost? A road is a continuous line, which divides any given area. If you know in which direction the road is (these guys even had a compass), just hike in a straight line towards it. You cannot miss it. OK, these guys walked in circles (how you do this with a compass is a mystery (maybe the only one in `Blair Witch')). Why didn't they just walk up or down one of plentiful streams they passed?<br/><br/>Therefore, the summary of `Blair Witch' could be:<br/><br/>Three resource less idiots (played by abysmally bad actors) go into a forest looking for signs of witchcraft or a witch and get lost. They get scared, and even the little intelligence they displayed in the beginning evaporates. After that, they do everything wrong, bicker a lot with each other in the most senseless way and finally disappear is an abandoned house in the forest that may or may not have anything to do with the witch they were looking for.<br/><br/>The whole think is played out in about 80 tedious minutes, filmed with poorly handled handheld cameras, bad sound or no refinement commonly associated with film making.<br/><br/>Or, as a one-liner:<br/><br/>A student film project gone horribly wrong.<br/><br/>My opinion: 10/10 for the marketing, ***minus***5***/10 for the movie.

","""In October 1994, three film student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary...."" ""A year later their footage was found"" This great quote in short tells the details of the Blair Witch plot. It is a plot that like most horror films can be questioned. How can the woods be the only setting? What is the purpose to this? Could it really work with only three cast members? Taking this all together, still The Blair Witch Project is something we could never have experienced or predicted what it was going to be.<br/><br/>By using a small budget of only $20,000 to $25,000 aside from the opening shots, The Blair Witch Project is set only in the woods. The setting of the woods helps this film break the norm for horror movies. The woods here have a strange eerie feel, and is very original. You have the feeling along with characters of never getting out and no doubt it will you make at wilderness quite differently.<br/><br/>With the small budget, the film only needs three cast members. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the only girl of the group and really emerges as the leader as they try to get out of the woods. Mike (Michael Williams) is a character who becomes very creepy once the harmful effects in the woods prey on him. Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the quiet member of the group in this bad situation. The cast really works due to the good acting by actors who are unknowns who we don't recognize making it realistic.<br/><br/>After a plot and story that seems like it can't get much better, the ending is one that REALLY can't much better. The ending comes out of nowhere as again it is in the woods and in a place that seems like it's in the middle of nowhere. It is a heart-pounding and very scary ending. The final shot is very clever as there are different possible theories raised about what just happened. This is one of the best endings in movie history, no doubt.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is not normal horror. It is horror that goes way above the normal common ground and makes it's own mark on the movie world. We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top."
"sashank_kini-1","9","3","7","24 August 2012"," Such Experimentation, Such Capable Acting and Fine Editing, I'm Simply Baffled at the Hate for Blair Witch Project
","The most striking thing about The Blair Witch Project is that the ending strikes you two seconds later, when the end credits begin. For a moment, your mind reels back to the preceding events and you realize how terrific and terrifying the moment is. Paranormal Activity, released much later may have more jump scenes, but nothing in the movie, not even the spooky as hell climax is as intense as Blair Witch's last fifteen or so seconds. If you think I am going to say 'The ending is great but the rest isn't', you are incorrect. Comments such as 'The worst movie ever', 'I hated this film', 'Indie crap' are written as usual without much justification, and that some call the characters 'absolutely unlikeable' is a thing I find utterly baffling.<br/><br/>Three newcomers – one a Shakespearean actress (Heather Donahue), another an experienced independent director (Joshua Leonard) and the other a theater actor (Michael C. Williams) not just act but also film most of their scenes in an isolated forest area using a 16mm and handicam and not just that, the actors were not aware of what was to happen in the woods since the directors didn't tell them what would happen next in their scenes. In the director's commentary, one realizes how spontaneously the three amigos (not exactly 'amigos', just using it because it sounds sweet, sad and ironic) improvised their scenes in order to extract realistic performances. Donahue, who won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for an act that should've clinched her a Golden Globe nomination, is believed to have modeled her character on a director with whom she had worked with. With such experimentation, such capable acting and such fine editing, I am simply astonished that the word 'worst' is attributed to The Blair Witch Project. 'Unlikable characters'? So if the characters were unlikable, then the reviewers should've loved the film since they 'got what they deserved' according to them – similar to the unlikable characters of Final Destination series. What is get from reading their reviews is plain contradiction – I think the moment they realized it was a shaky camera, they judged every other element superficially. <br/><br/>The plot is simple: Three student filmmakers begin making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and this leads them to the forest where the witch is believed to have existed. Things turn sour when they find stuff in the forest they aren't supposed to, which is ironic since these stuffs would've made their documentary even more credible. They realize that the Blair Witch is simply not a myth of the ignoramus past, and that this force would always work in a similar fashion: haunt at night, leave an after effect in the morning. They also have to maintain their sanity even when tensions and tempers are high. Shaky camera is probably the best aspect of Blair Witch Project. How close we are to the action, how much we anticipate like the actors about what's to happen, how much we are involved in the film because of this wonderful camera technique; it is something only a person who is ready to adjust to any film would understand. Remember Meryl Streep's line at the Oscars: 'When they called my name I had this feeling I could hear half of America going, ""oh, no!""', the same thing may apply to certain audience members when they sensed the shaky camera 'When they saw shaky camera, half of the audience members went 'Oh no!'. You have to look beyond that.<br/><br/>The camera work is crisp, highly engaging and very ingenious, even though the actors themselves didn't realize some of the best shot scenes by them were accidental. I never imagined Donahue's last message to her parents was an accidental stroke of greatness till I saw the director's commentary: Heather had thought the camera was recording her entire face while she shot the sequence. Also the interesting shot of Michael in one the bottom left corner of the screen while the rest of the frame is taken up by the tall, foreboding trees was accidental. Even the perfectly coordinated shot of Michael walking away at a distance while Donahue is talking to Joshua in front. Everything is raw, raging and unconventional.<br/><br/>Interviews with local townspeople are also very engaging, since some of the members were non-actors: Advice – don't miss the director's commentary if you have the DVD; you may find new love for the movie. Another advice: do not sleep during those things, considering them on trivial importance. Coming to the three main stars, Donahue is certainly the best, channeling so many emotions in the course of the film effortlessly. The scenes where she breaks down are absolutely powerful. Great support from the two guys, and again, you'll get to see 'Michael's Great Moment No 1,2' in the director's commentary. The DVD version does go for an overkill with the made for TV feature that seems silly and excessive – it reminded me of a silly animated movie we had made for a competition where we included dozens of additional attractions, including fake reviews for the film within the film. <br/><br/>Verdict: Recommended.

","The cultural phenomenon that was The Blair Witch Project cannot be overstated. The found footage era of filmmaking caught hold and became the main way to put forth the horror genre for years. Despite the hundreds of movies that have used this technique only a handful have been any good.The Blair Witch Project succeeds more on what you can't see than what you can. The human terror of darkness is used to full effect here and the actors do such a stellar job of being immersed in the fear of the unknown that it swoops you right along with them. The Blair Witch Project stands as a classic that is still unsettling but also stretched the rules of a genre and how films were made and seen."
"coneill97","7","2","4","24 October 2019"," A Chillingly Realistic Found Footage Movie
","What Blair Witch Project does so well, is create an unsettling, uncomfortable tone that lingers throughout the movie. There is a constant feeling of unease that takes place as soon as the three lead characters enter the woods.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of making a tale about witchcraft feel so realistic. This is primarily due to the incredibly believable performances of the cast, especially the main three, who we spent much of the runtime with. They always feel like real people, and their frustrations and fights with one another never feel forced but feel as if the oppressive atmosphere of the woods is influencing their actions.<br/><br/>The movie has an incredibly effective setup, with locals from the town telling stories of the Blair Witch legend. The fact that these stories feel like they're being told from the perspective of real people gives them a chilling quality.<br/><br/>The low quality, found-footage documentary style also adds to the grounded tone. It does not feel like a conventional movie due to the lack of a narrative structure or musical score. The occasional use of a 16mm black and white cameras is very effective in adding a chilling quality to the film, especially the daytime scenes in the woods.<br/><br/>The use of sounds in this film is incredible. A lot of this movie takes place at night with a blank black screen, where we can hear only distant noises. By not showing us anything, it allows the audience to imagine what is out there in the woods, which makes it even scarier. This also applies to the Blair Witch, who we never see throughout the movie at all. Our imagination is more terrifying than anything that could have been put on screen. Despite not appearing, her presence is felt throughout.<br/><br/>The final ten minutes of this movie is genuinely terrifying, with simple images such as children's handprints on the walls of the abandoned house in the woods, sticking with the viewer long after the film ends. And while it does end very abruptly, the final shot is very unsettling and gets under your skin.<br/><br/>While the sense of realism created by the filmmakers works so effectively throughout the movie, it also has its negatives. By creating such realistic and believable central characters, they become unremarkable and uninteresting with minimal characterisation. This is only a minor flaw, however in an otherwise excellent horror movie."
"azeemnavarro","9","2","4","14 August 2019"," More than just marketing
","We know how this movie came to theaters: with (maybe) the best marketing campaign of all time. An internet website, the directors listing the actors as missing, create a local legend... that's some of the tactics used to make viewers think that this movie was real. Because that, some people thought that what they saw on Blair Witch was real (sorry, I love the marketing for this, but that's not really intelligent). And that's also thanks to the found footage technique they implemented to make the film. This type of filmmaking wasn't really new, we have films like Cannibal Holocaust, Guinea Pig, The Last Broadcast...and though some of them made some noise, Blair Witch was the one that, for better or for worse, popularized the 'sub-genre'.
Now, what is Blair Witch about? Is about three not-so-likable student filmmakers that go on to woods to make a documentary about a legend know as the Blair Witch. And that, is the perfect setting for a movie of this type. With a budget so low, what we get is just scenes of mad people lost in the forest, trying to get out of there. And because of that, the movie has some pacing issues, and audiences that like to consume the McDonald's equivalent of horror movies, will hate this.
Our three main guys do a excelent job conducting the story, more if you consider some of the reactions are real or are improv. The way the movies was made, with the actors throwed in the woods with some provisions and directions of what to do and filmed, is very clever, the night scenes are amazing because of that, the actors were actually frightened, and you can tell that. And that ending, is very powerful, it's one of my favorites from any horror film.
Yes, Blair Witch is an example of how you shold promote your film, but if you actually look at the film, you will realize this is a masterful take on the mockumentary genre. Recommended for anyone that has pacience and can appreciate a slow burn."

","I can remember being 10 years old with my eyes glues to the TV on a Saturday night, brownie in hand, glass of milk on the table, and a drawing pad for when advertisements came on between breaks (commercials have always given me headaches).. I can remember the teaser trailer for BWP and remember thinking ""WHAT..WAS THAT"".. I was mortified. Later I learned that there were debates on whether it was actually real or not.. How f'ing scary is that? Even public news stations were conflicted in identifying it's authenticity. The buzz was because of the pre-meditated campaign that the creators easter egged around the internet, local TV stations, and faux-documentaries to really push the boundaries of a film that would freak out theatergoers around the world. <br/><br/>The result? Panic attacks, people fleeing the theaters, afterglows of intense guilt for what they thought was a supernatural snuff film. People were in complete shock. This is also a result of the methodically torturous stress that was put on the cast. They were made to stay up without sleep, going into the woods at night blind and not exactly knowing just what to expect in the pitch dark woods. The fear and panic on the screen was certainly real, and that's why it's so effective: it's not the ""goul"" making howling badger noises. It's the faint sound of a crying baby, going in circles, time warping dizziness coming to life on screen before our eyes, forcing the viewer to fall into the pit of madness with the characters on screen. <br/><br/>I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre that don't get thrilled by body parts flying in the Saw series but rather the crowd that gets goosebumps from the like of The Babadook, The Changeling and Pulse.

"bowmanblue","8","2","4","28 December 2015"," The (sort of) original and (sort of) best
","'The Blair Witch Project' invented the 'found footage' portion of the horror genre. Well, it kind of did. The genre was technically lurking in the background, somewhere behind the slasher genre and low budget zombie flicks. You could probably trace it back to such cinematic delights as 'Cannibal Holocaust' in the seventies (only you'd probably regret it if you did). Anyway, The Blair Witch Project may not have entirely invented the type of film which is purely watching shaky hand-held camera-work filmed (for the purposes of the story) by the characters we're following, but it did bring it back to the forefront of horror-movie making. Maybe that along means I should despise it. Only I don't.<br/><br/>If you're not familiar with the 'found footage' genre then you probably don't watch enough horror films, therefore any interest you may have in watching three teenagers get lost in a woods will be minimal. That's pretty much the story. The three of them are film students and decide to make – you guessed it – a project on the (allegedly fictional) 'Blair Witch.' Naturally, things don't go according to plan and, if getting lost wasn't annoying enough, some unseen force starts to mess with their little school trip (and one girl gets a runny nose – if you've already seen it you'll know what I mean).<br/><br/>You may have picked up on my use of the word 'unseen.' For all found footage films are cheaply produced (okay, feel free to shout me down with such epics as 'Cloverfield' and the odd high budget one, but MOST are!). That way the film-makers don't really have to spend that much money on special effects when they can just have the person holding the camera shake it about a bit and then run off. This is the Blair Witch Project all over. If you're expecting hordes of computer-generated monsters storming the woods and chasing our hapless teens down then you're going to be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>You have to realise that you're going to get long periods of time where not that much happens. The highlight for much of the film is crossing the same river again and again. When I read what I've written I really think I'm not really selling the ol' BWP very well. Believe it or not, I did enjoy it. Back when I watched it in 1999 it was still a fresh genre and, not including old 'video nasties' was pretty original. Plus the acting was good. It really felt adlibbed (actually I think some was) and what you might expect from watching hours upon hours of footage filmed by just some bloke behind the camera. Perhaps one of the reasons I enjoyed it was because I spent a fair proportion of my childhood as a young boy getting (sort of deliberately) lost in the woods and could relate to how creepy the prospect of never getting home again could be (although I made sure I was never more than a stone's throw away from the road and with my dad at all times!).<br/><br/>The three actors themselves were just about likable enough, but they do get a little bit annoying and whiney towards the end. I guess that could be explained by them slowly losing their minds due to their predicament, so, if you don't mind their constant swearing, it can be excused.<br/><br/>So, if you're okay with 'found footage' films and are interested in the one that spawned a hundred inferior clones, then give this one a go. It's not long and you won't waste too much of your life on it. It's genuinely creepy here and there. Just don't bother with the sequel which doesn't even bother to be original and is just your standard horror cliché-fest.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you don't think much to the way BWP ended, you're not the only one. It's a love or hate ending. I guess Family Guy hated it – look up the clip of Brian Griffin the cinema watching Blair Witch on Youtube and see that you're not alone. I felt a little cheated, but grew to accept that that was the way it was just going to be."

","Let me sum up the whole movie for you. Some kids go into the woods to shoot a documentary and they die. That is the whole movie. Now just because a movie has this plot does not mean it will be bad because most horror movies have fairly simplistic plots and I like good horror movies. I will get this out of the way right now, I am 15 and if you are going to be the d*ck head who will not take my review seriously simply based on my age just go away. First of all, this movie is not nearly as ""innovative"" as so many people say. Cannibal Holocaust, The Texas Chainsaw massacre, and every film from the Dogme '95 movement used this sort of camera work to give the films a realistic feel. The real brilliance came from the marketing campaign because at the time of the film's release many people believed that this was an actual documentary and IMDb even said that the actors were dead, so many moviegoers were obviously scared even before they went to the theaters. The main problem is actually that this feels too much like a realistic paranormal documentary because this means we don't get to know very much about the characters, so now that we know these aren't real people we don't have much reason to care about them. Finally my biggest gripe is that nothing happens. There are no scares until the end and the only build up we get are a few interesting (yes, I said something positive) interviews with the people of the town this takes place in, so we have very little reason to suspect that the Blair Witch is real. I realize that this was scary back in the day with all of the build up and I don't want to destroy your good memories or viewing experience if the effect still remains with you. I just want to explain that in all honesty this movie has aged poorly and is on my sh*t list."

","This movie is serious business, very frightening experience to say the least. Since I am someone who always wanted to make a documentary of my own, I could relate to it more but I am pretty sure, all of us film ourselves during such expeditions these days. The film triumphs in two areas. One in consuming your entire attention span to travel with these three characters, the other in presenting it to you in a more believable, frightening manner (pieced through amateur footage) This movie is an influential work because it then spawned a slew of similarly made movies (although Cannibal Holocaust was made earlier, this seemed more real and entertaining to this day and age). I thoroughly enjoyed the horror aspect of this movie, and I am not someone who finds horror movies very shaking (Except for The Exorcist, of course) but this was quite scary. I felt mind- numbing frustration in situations when the main characters' spirit & tolerance started to decline, and slowly begin to realize how meek, insignificant we are if we are not part of our society or within our comfort zone or left it the dark with an unknown fear factor, with very crazy things happening around you but you can't see or tell what it is. The makers manage to infuse terror in a very natural way too, that's the main success feature of the film. I feel sorry for some viewers in this forum who couldn't enjoy the film because they were trying to make 'sense' out of the characters shooting such frightening situations, calling it unrealistic etc. Probably why IMDb has a low rating for this movie too. It never bothered me, my suggestion is either you don't notice it/disregard it OR you look at film as their passion, or something humans can do in hopeless situations (ie, if I know my fate is sealed in such a terrifying situation, I would consider filming myself so that the world gets to know what happened to me someday, now that I can't save myself anymore). Watch the early interviews with locals carefully (real people) for you to understand the ending very well. Excellent movie. Definitely goes down as one of my all favourites.

They end up getting lost in the woods while being stalked by someone or something.<br/><br/>The film entirely shot on video and cheap, black and white film supporting the feeling that the film is found footage and it works. Something about the look of it, and given the fact that the movie was made a very low budget and there is no music, gives it a sense of realism and a unique atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting is great, too. All the actors are very natural and, apart from the occasional one or two cheesy line, remain consistent throughout and giving a real sense of fear to the point where you feel like you are among this group and sharing the fear with them.<br/><br/>However, one major complaint that I have is a lot of the time the camera is shaking all way too much to really make out what exactly is going on and is literally black at some points as in you cannot see a thing which is pretty annoying but not to the point where it is unwatchable. Another minor complaint is that sometimes you cannot hear what the characters are saying due to the limited range on the microphone on the cheap cameras they used but this only occurs a couple of times and, again, is bearable.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film and a spooky experience that you will not soon forget."

Think again the sequel is awful. Nothing like this. There is no special effects what makes the film more realistic. You don't see the witch. Which in my opinion is better as your imagination goes wild to think what actually the witch looks like. I hear they are making a new Blair witch sometime this year or the next but I don't know and it will never match up to this perfect original horror film. Please take your time to watch and do not talk through it as you need to listen to the film. :)"

","This is one of the most awful overrated, over touted, and waste of a viewers time ever made. The only credit I give to this movie is that it actually fooled a lot of people into thinking it was a true story and it launched the worst trend ever in the industry now known as the ""Found footage"" movie or what I call it: ""The new excuse to make a really bad movie"" trend.<br/><br/>This movie is not scary at all. I felt like a genius when I waited for this to come out on DVD, because as I expected, it was horrible. I do say that at the time it was a genius idea and it was something new. It is one of those ideas that should have just stayed that, an idea.<br/><br/>I can't believe people got conned into this crap. The acting was poor, it was basically shot as a home movie. Do you enjoy when your friends break out the family vacation videos? No, I didn't think so. So why do I want to watch a movie that is about the same thing.<br/><br/>Was it scary...not even close. I have seen Disney cartoons that are scarier than this. If fact this movie was credited for making movie goers sick because of the bouncing around poor quality photography.<br/><br/>If you want to see scary home video's go down to the local Walmart and ask to see their security tapes, they are bound to be more interesting and far more nightmarish then this heap of dung.<br/><br/>Like my reviews, Hate em?

","When I heard about this movie, I had no idea what was so special about it. To me, it seemed like a cheesy low budget movie that had no scary elements to it. Just a bunch of teenagers running around with video cameras in the woods. The spoofs of this movie didn't help either. Last Halloween, I decided to rent this movie and watch it alone one night. I don't think I ever had such trouble sleeping as I did that night. This movie is defiantly one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. It's a rarity when a movie scares me at all, let alone follow me far after the screen is turned off. It's a shame to me that this movie is so underrated. It is unfortunate that people hate this movie because of its lack of special effects, music, and other elements of the modern horror movie (most of which i despise). Perhaps the reason most people did not enjoy this movie is because they actually need to use some brain power to grasp the true horror of this picture. Unlike most horror movies these days where producers use flashy gimmicks to distract viewers from a lack of plot or writing, the Blair Witch Project uses only reality and believable situations, leaving a raw, shocking experience for those intelligent enough to enjoy it. To me, the reason this movie is so successful is because of how real it feels, and that your imagination is left to do so much. The plot could easily of been based on a true story, and many people actually thought this movie was real at its release. Despite not being real or based on anything, it isn't preposterous to think something like this can happen. As you may of noticed, I haven't mentioned anything specific about the movie. This is because once you know the basic idea, thats all you need. Anything more is spoiler, and will ruin the experience. Just trust me, if you are sick of most horror movies, give this a shot. Watch it alone, at night, with the lights out. It's an experience you will never forget."

This might have been a genuine scary experience for the actors, but it wasn't for me. I felt bored and irritated. I have a very good imagination, but this film did not inspire it at all. The only reason I watched to the end was to find out if anything justified the hype. But nothing did. I was just relieved that all the screams had been quenched.

","When this movie came out I listened to the hype for quite a while. I've loved horror movies most of my life though I gave up on them when they sank into special-effects gore-fests and expressions of very personal paranoia in the 1980s. I finally gave this film a try when it came to a second run house in my city that charged 99 cents per ticket. One can see anything for 99 cents. When I left, the manager asked what I'd thought of the movie. He knew that I was a regular and that I liked films generally. I told him I thought he owed me at least 98 cents.<br/><br/>In summary, a group of young people with video equipment wander out into the woods on the Maryland/West Virginia border. To characterize their combined I.Q.'s as ""super 8"" would be too generous. The area in which they get lost in the woods is rural but not the Amazonian rain forest or the wastes of Siberia. Walking for less than an hour in any direction would bring them to a road, a task that is far from impossible to accomplish. Still they get lost. Once they are lost they descend into fear and get, as if such a thing were possible, even stupider. In the end the alleged Blair Witch does us all the great service of removing these self-indulgent idiots from the gene pool. The really bad news is that the witch takes about 90 minutes to accomplish that removal. She's just too darned slow.<br/><br/>This movie does not have the utterly misguided and endearing incompetence that make Ed Wood's films like Plan 9 From Outer Space a guilty pleasure.

","The first time I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" was when I was 13. I had fallen asleep within the first 45 minutes. I had been extremely disappointed. Now, I had heard about how ""Paranormal Activity"" is one of the creepiest horror movies of the year. I thought that if I'm going to see ""Paranormal Activity,"" then I'd better watch this movie again in order to know what I'm in for. After a second viewing, I admit that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is absolutely one of the creepiest horror movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Shot like footage, ""BWP"" follows three student filmmakers shooting a documentary: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. Heather is the head director of a documentary about the infamous Blair Witch of Blair, Maryland. After many strange and eerie stories of the witch, including the tales of over seven children being kidnapped and found dead, the three teens are pretty skeptical that there really is any witch living in the woods of Burkitsville. As they venture into the woods to shoot their film, strange things happen, things that they never thought would happen. Things that are going to tear them apart emotionally. Heather, Josh, and Mike discover that the Blair Witch might be more than just a legend.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" opens as a seemingly ordinary documentary-style horror movie. But there is plenty to love about it. As the movie progresses, it unfolds with a horrifying tension, with an event just as frightening as the one before it. Also, the Burkitsville woods are a perfect atmosphere for the movie. The camera kept closing in on the cast, and it produced a strong feeling of claustrophobia. Whenever I heard a noise in the background, and one of the filmmakers would scream ""What the **** was that?!"", I kept turning my head back and forth to see if there was anything there. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very good example of ""What you don't see is scarier than what you do see."" <br/><br/>The movie gives excellent performances by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Mike Williams. The most iconic moment of the movie, with Heather turning on the camera and making a tearjerking apology to her family and the others, is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the movie.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" was a movie with a very low budget of 11,000 dollars. And after a lot of hype, audiences ran to the theaters and were scared out of their wits, bringing in over 5, million dollars in a weekend. The movie had beaten out the box-office record that was held by the horror classic ""Halloween."" This movie takes a rather simple premise and goes a long way with it. It's scary, eerie, claustrophobic, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is perfect psychological horror.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't watch it at night. Plus, the climax is gut-wrenching."

The movie is nothing more then an independent success, and a true underdog movie story; but it just didn't go for me. Some value it as the scariest movie ever made, I don't think so. Sure it didn't have any music, and was recorded hand-free, like a real-life situation; but I didn't find that popular, and innovative scariness in this movie. It just felt like an ordinary horror. So, a ordinary horror; with bad screen work and no sound editing: its not a good movie, is it?

I've read a lot about this film and many of the commentaries, especially on IMDb, were positive to the point of ecstatic. I wanted to be scared out of my wits, like the original 'Night of the Living Dead' caused me to be. Perhaps this expectation and hope is largely responsible for my deep disappointment. <br/><br/>It starts off fairly promisingly with interviews with the locals of the town on the edge of the haunted woods. There is humor and believability in these first minutes, then it all goes down the tube as soon as the three students enter the woods. The last hour of this movie is boring as can be and I found it very difficult to convince myself that these actors were really alone in the woods without some sort of pre-conceived guidance. How else could they have made their way to the house at the end?<br/><br/>And the bobbing and lurching cameras caused me to have to take a break in the middle to go lie down and relax my stiff neck. The feeling was very much like being in a small launch in the Gulf of Mexico in a 9 foot swell. <br/><br/>The best aspects of this film are the interesting folk art elements scattered around in the woods.

Once in our seats, many people around us were laughing and joking about the story, and what to expect.<br/><br/>A man came in from the side door, and put both of his arms in the air in an attempt to quiet the young audience. He was an employee of the cinema and he began to speak with an incredible tone of seriousness.<br/><br/>""Everyone please keep all of you're talking to a minimum, and please silence your pagers(cell phones weren't owned by many at this point). He said. ""This is a true story of these three young adults, and of how they lost their lives in a very tragic way."" With that, he exited.<br/><br/>The hecklers were reduced to a minority, and it seemed as if no one spoke for quite some time. There was an uneasiness in the air that both myself and my girlfriend felt. Suddenly she leaned over and whispered in my ear.<br/><br/>""Come on let's go see something else..."" Before she could even finish her sentence, the lights died down, and the story began. We sat, glued to our seats, as it unfolded in such a way that you could barely tear your eyes away, and if you did, you were fearful that you would miss something vital.<br/><br/>At this point, I was totally convinced that what I was witnessing was real. There was no room in my mind for doubt or logic, and the employee that spoke up in the beginning took care of that.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project concluded, and I could never be more content with a movie after the first viewing.

","I believe a scary movie, can only be effective once. You never know what's going to happen next, your at the edge of your seat, staring off into the darkness to see whats lurking there, this movie mastered that. Once your drawn in, it doesn't let you go. I personally, was drawn in entirely, I felt like I was actually there with them the entire time, thus is why the movie was incredibly effective to me. <br/><br/>The actual story in the movie surrounding the legend is creepy as hell. Children are vanishing, one by one until they are eventually found butchered inside a secluded house deep in the woods. Killed by a deranged man telling everyone an old woman ghost told him to kill them all. The little girl disappearing for days, then returning babbling about an old woman who's feet never touched the ground. The whole making one kid face into the corner while he killed the other, then killing the one in the corner. That definitely stuck in my mind until the end. When Mike says, ""Its a house."" nearing the end, I began to tense up. Imagining myself in that situation is absolutely terrifying. Out in the middle of nowhere, in a forest in pitch black, your friend is yelling for help and you stubble upon a house...Jesus. When the girl descends down into the dark, scary as hell, cellar, that moment she turns and you see Mike in the corner, that moment was extremely terrifying and effective. The fact thats what that murderer would do, and he was caught and executed years ago, so he's out of the question...just gave me a flood of chills. Its just scary, there's no other words I can think of. I can only picture what else was in that room. That other kid butchered on the floor? The ""Blair Witch""? Yeesh, it just scares me.<br/><br/>The fact you don't see anything is the exact reason why this movie scared the crap out of me. Im going to say what a lot of other people have already said, it did was Jaws did for going into the water and what Psycho did for taking a shower. Not only dark forests, but just staring into darkness scares me because of this movie. No other movie has scared me the way this one has. Like I said once you've seen it, thats it. Its only effective once, but hell, its powerful. This movie was a frightening experience, and I loved it. I can safely say, this movie is definitely one of my favourites. I just really really hope I don't fall asleep one night, and I end up dreaming up being in any situation resembling The Blair Witch Project."
"lozza333","7","2","4","1 November 2007"," justifies all the attention it received upon it's release
","This was one of the scarier horror films I've seen and for that alone I can call it a great film. Having seen it many years after it was made, I missed all the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project upon it's initial release. I had heard many different opinions from different people; it seemed like a 50/50 divide between who liked it and who didn't. That probably levelled my expectations as I simply didn't know what to expect. But I really enjoyed it and some parts of the film were the 'heart-pounding-hard-in-your-chest' moments you expect from all horror films, except that they were amplified by a heightened sense of reality with the documentary-style filming. This is ultimately what the film relies on for it's horror of course; it draws you very close to the hearts and minds of the characters involved and you genuinely feel scared for them. So many horror films simply have characters 'made for dying', that you don't really care about and are just included to eventually become victims.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the low-budget, low-gore style it employs, simply because it still scares you regardless. There are some flaws in the editing style needed to be employed to make it realistic (ie. times when it is unrealistic for them to have their camera switched on, but would be very scary to watch for the audience) and I did feel the film came to a quite abrupt end. But it is also very necessary to applaud the actors, who are part of the reason the film is so believable. Overall, you can't fault the way in which this film helped reinvigorate the horror genre. With the number of mindless slasher films reaching stupid levels in the mid-90s - Friday 13th Part 9 was released in 1993 and A Nightmare On Elm Street 7 in 1994... - I can still feel today, even watching it 8 years later, how important this film was."

","With no blood and gore, no disgustingly disturbing CGI monsters, and no shocking moments to 'jump off your seat' the average horror film watcher would flick this film to the side without a second glance. However, so fresh and new was the way in which The Blair Witch was shot, and so convincingly acted by the three characters, that The Blair Witch Project makes a very chilling and disturbing horror.<br/><br/>There is no way that this film would have been as successful as it was without its cunning yet controversial promotion campaign. Cinemas filled on the opening week, full of audiences expecting to see what they thought was real footage, found a year after the three main characters had disappeared in the woods down in Burkettsville, Maryland. <br/><br/>The way in which The Blair Witch was shot, no matter what critics say, only added to the horrific experience. Even though I knew this was fake footage the hand-held camera dragged me right into the three characters bleak position, leaving me to ponder what I would do if in their shoes. The use of the two cameras, with only one camera having sound, proved very effective. In the last scene (without giving anything away) the use of one camera seeing the action while the other camera picks up the sound of the same action creates an even more weird, confusing and sickening noise. <br/><br/>The noises heard in the nights sound so unfamiliar that it is hard to connect them with anything comforting, while the scene where the tent is pummelled by 'something' while Heather screams ""What the F**k is that!?"" leave your heart thudding and your brain working double time in an attempt to make out what is going on.<br/><br/>The most impressive component of this film is the way the audience are forced to use their own imagination. Never before in a horror has the whole film been based around the unknown, leaving the audience to create their own image of what the 'hunter/hunters' may be. This image created in the audiences head can be much more horrific than any CGI monster.<br/><br/>As you can already tell I thoroughly enjoyed this film, finding it hard to pull my eyes away, dreading what was to come as each new night bought a new horror. I would suggest this film to anyone, as long as you don't mind losing your ability to spend a night camping in the woods."

I feel that this was the birth of the psychological horror film.<br/><br/>What also helped this was the fact that the actors used their real names in the film, and the website that accompanied it helped to create the illusion that this incident portrayed in the film was a true event.<br/><br/>Fabulous acting (and REAL snot coming out of Heather Donahue's nose in that heartbreaking famous scene), great shots and eerie locations also help to boost the scariness of TBWP.<br/><br/>Definitely a film you must see before you die.<br/><br/>10/10."

","""The Blair Witch Project"" is undoubtedly, unquestionably, flawlessly the most creative horror film in history. It takes on the concept of deception and friendship, tormenting us with its ability to make us wonder, as the three protagonists are baffled, attacked, and ultimately, fall victim to the demon in the film. ""Blair Witch"" displays three college students, hoping for nothing but a good grade and some fun along the way, who create a documentary on a local ghost story. They interview people who claim to have seen or experienced the presence of that ghost, commonly known as the blair witch. The groups leader feels she needs more though, and alongside her fellow classmates, ventures into the forest, where the witch is claimed to lurk. The terror starts slightly, and almost unnoticeably with small fragments from the interviewees tales. From there, they grow, into late night catastrophe, hearing footsteps, screams, and experiencing voodoo like symbolism. From the second, the team enters the forest, we become tense, waiting for a nightmarish feat to be done upon our three, hopeless characters. The movie travels down a twisting, turning road of betrayal, uncertainty, and overall humanism.

","Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest. Who would have thought three college kids being chased by an unseen ghost would have become one of the highest-grossing films of all time? The idea was so simple, almost quaint, I wish I'd thought of it. I'd be sitting in a hot tub in Aruba with Paris Hilton now . . . but that's a different story. This film struck a chord with the American public that's hard to identify. What did the Blair Witch represent? Was she nature, raped and despoiled by male-dominated American bourgeois society? Was she the Goddess of the Witches, Hecate, striking back for having been persecuted by Christianity? Or was the film itself an affirmation of Christian values, as so many horror films ironically are? Certainly the three student filmmakers come to grief after scoffing at the Bible-toting old woman's chilling tale of her own encounter with the Blair Witch. The film has obvious parallels with Stephen King's ""It"" and much of H.P. Lovecraft. Whatever. Anyone can make a movie, but not everyone can make a GOOD movie. ""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeded in part due to clever Internet hype, but largely due to the raw, cinema-verite film-making that imparted grisly authenticity to what otherwise might have been a cheesy exploitation film, and to the superb improvisational skills of three talented young character actors--Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams. We could identify with them thanks to their very ordinariness. They were everyone's son, daughter, boyfriend, brother, sister. Their plight reminded one of soldiers caught behind enemy lines in wartime . . . Ironically, the real Burkitville MD (yes, Virginia, there is a Burkitville) is close to the sight of some major Civil War battles. The bottom line is, it's a darn good film."
"aschachte","2","2","4","25 November 2006"," Not a bad job considering the budget
","Spoilers First off, I applaud them for making lots of money with no real investment. A hoax like this can only be done once. There were a couple of nice touches in the movie, like them trying to follow a stream and winding up in the same spot. That's freaky. Also, good acting. But the effects were extremely cheesy, like the four guys beating the sides of tent. Was I really supposed to think it was anything else? Maybe it's because this movie never really ""took me there"". At least with the Ninth Gate, I could suspend disbelief long enough to accept the idea that the three books really are evil and the hero's life might have been in danger a few times, but not here. Also you never actually see the Blair Witch. It's kind of like making a song about a Teenage Wasteland and calling it Baba O'Reilly. Where is Baba O'Reilly? You might say the Witch is invisible to explain her pronounced absence. Ah, but then how did they have an old drawing of the Witch in that book? Hmn? Also the editing was impossible. If you're recording the same thing with two separate cameras, you will get the same action twice from two separate perspectives, not a smoothly-edited single thread of continuity. I especially chuckled when the one guy was talking into one camera and his voice carried over flawlessly into the footage of the other camera, all supposedly unedited. That was really obvious. By editing it professionally, it lost any credibility it might have had in my mind. And why did they go in that house anyway? How stupid was that? To make matters worse, they made a companion video for this movie (before Blair Witch 2) that you could rent, supposedly of ""newly-discovered"" video. At least they threw it in free when I rented Blair Witch. It was the one guy and the girl sitting in the tent saying things like, ""Wow, that was a lot of weird stuff that happened today, huh?"" ""Did you ever figure out what those twig figures were?"" ""No. I never saw nuthin' like that. Crazy, huh?"" This companion movie was obviously shot with a different camera than either of the ones used in making Blair Witch, making it an even more obvious fake, and it was twice as boring.<br/><br/>While we're at it, didn't they film the inside of the Witch's house? If real, the cameras should still be in there. Who discovered the film without getting killed by the Witch? There was absolutely no way for me to get into the illusion of this movie with so many flaws continually shouting at me that it was a hoax. They might as well have put that kid from The Last Action Hero in here saying over and over, ""It's just a movie. It's not real."" It astounds me to think that some people actually thought it was a true documentary. On the scary scale, 1 to 10, I give this a 2, only for the few freaky (but not really scary) scenes. This was tied with Batman as most over-hyped movie of the 90's."

I honestly don't think it was scary, except for the end which I SO won't tell, but if it had been filmed in another form besides with lousy cameras by a bunch of kids, the movie wouldn't have the same impact. It seemed so real because of that. I enjoyed it very much, but i think people have to look at it as a film acheivment rather than an actual motion picture. <br/><br/>People I know either laugh or shudder when I told them I was going to watch this movie, so I really didn't know what to expect.

For example, ""The Blair Witch Project"": The only good thing about that movie is the acting. The rest of the movie sucks!!!! ""The Blair Witch Project"" pulled off something that very few horror movies managed to do: It made me hate it. In a nutshell, three college students do some interviews asking questions about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch"". After that, they drive out to the woods to solve the mystery of the Blair Witch.....and guess what? Not only do they NOT solve the mystery, but nobody survives. What a crappy film. The makers of the movie tried to go for a ""realistic"" approach to a horror movie, but in doing so, I swear to god upon everything in the universe, it is the only horror movie that made me bored stiff.

"Golgo-13","10","2","4","2 September 2005"," Great horror.
","I watched The Blair Witch Project again (and the commentary and extras). Was it still a good movie, was it still scary? Absolutely. The characters were strong and realistic and showed real emotions, the setting was perfect and fully used, and the use of sound was awesome. All that made for an incredible atmosphere. At only 77 minutes, the movie moved along at a brisk pace. The shaky footage wasn't that bad at all and some of the shots of the woods are just great. I will admit that some of the power of the film has somewhat diminished over the years (and from watching it at least four times!) but the same can be said of most any scary horror flick. The ending still gave me chills for a good fifteen seconds though. I even rewound it to check something and it creeped me out a second time! BWP is not conventional horror and that's one of the reasons it works so well (but maybe that's the problem for some people too?)it's different, unique. The presentation, backed up with the mythos, is what really makes this movie something special. I've never seen another quite like it. The DVD commentary is decent and goes over the making of the film. The makers discussed the great ideas and techniques used to make the film as realistic as possible. The three trailers were pretty cool toono wonder it was a box-office hit. I also watched Curse of the Blair Witch and Stick and Stones. Sticks and Stones is basically the same as CotBW, only it's edited a bit quicker. These documentaries are informative and compelling and help set up the mood for BWP but I didn't find them particularly scary. All in all, though, I really had a good time revisiting this whole cinematic experience."

"FZ-FX","3","2","4","23 May 2005"," All hype, no substance
","I have to admit that I too fell victim to the marketing hype around this film. It first stuck in my mind when I saw an ad for a special about the film on the SciFi channel (back when they didn't just run lame B-films). For those of you who are too young to remember the buzz around the theatrical release of ""The Blair Witch Project"", the film's marketing gave the impression that it was an actual documentary of three people becoming lost in the woods of Maryland and falling victim to a mysterious, supernatural power, local legend the Blair witch. It may seem a bit outlandish looking at it now, but the marketing was surprisingly convincing at selling this as an actual documentary, even going so far as to list the actors as missing. Through word of mouth and rumors, the film fascinated the public, who were left to wonder if the horrific events of the film had actually occurred. Even after it became widely known that the film was fictional, the hype surrounding the project and many positive reviews help the low budget B-film become one of the biggest hits of the year. <br/><br/>Before I begin, I'd like to say that I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre; but not because I don't like being scarred, but because I am very rarely frightened by movies. The key appeal of a horror movie to most people is it's ability to get them on the edge of their seat, and it very rarely does that for me. There are a couple that have rattled me (The Exorcist, Seven) and some I enjoy for their plots or directing (The Shining, Alien, Day of the Dead), but on a whole I don't get the genre, whether the film happens to be a teen slasher flick of the 1990's, a gore feast of yesteryear or even the classic Monster pictures of old Hollywood. <br/><br/>That said, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an hour and a half of sheer boredom and sloppy camera-work. For those who haven't seen it, it revolves around a group of three film students who set out to make a documentary on the Blair Witch, a legendary figure supposedly living in the woods of Maryland. Seen from a hand-held camera, it shows the group as they go from being enthusiastic about what they think is going to be a two day camping trip to slightly distressed about being lost to utterly terrified at being pursued by what we are led to assume is the Blair witch. The film is careful to never actually show the witch. The ""scares"" come from the students terrified reactions to their increasingly dire predicament. As the become more and more lost, they begin seeing signs of the witch and of course begin to hear odd noises in the night. Some would argue that the film is scary because of what you don't see; I find that little is given to make us believe that their truly is something evil stalking the students. In order to make the terror seem real, the film mostly relies on one thing: screaming. There is rarely a minute in the ""Blair Witch"" where one of the kids isn't screaming their lungs out over something. Would real people react the same way in the same situation? Probably, but this doesn't make it interesting. The simple fact is that the movie lacks almost any tension what-so-ever, and rarely manages to surprise (the reasonably well scripted ending being the exception). <br/><br/>To its credit, the acting does lends to the documentary feel of the film well. Since the students aren't actually shooting their documentary most of the time, we see them acting like fairly normal college students, which means crude jokes, pot smoking and an abundance of profanity. The acting, while certainly not interesting by any means, is effecting in creating the illusion that these were real events. The characters seem like a trio of goof balls on a camping trip, and their reactions to their growing troubles are believable. The ""real"" acting can't change the fact that never once are we intrigued by a character's reaction to the horrors around them, as the reaction is almost always the same: running, screaming and talking about how scared they are into the camera. <br/><br/>I've got to hand it to the people who masterminded the ""Blair Witch"", because they certainly managed to do well; making well over $200 million dollars from a movie that cost just over twenty grand to produce. While arguably one of the biggest phenomena of 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" hasn't become the classic many people said it would become. This is all well with me, because despite the fact that it scarred a whole lot of people, the ""Blair Witch"" is a movie without a hint of substance, even by horror standards. I can remember very few other films that managed to bore me as much as this simple minded scream-fest. Perhapse I just don't get it, and I'm sure most people would be frightened by some of the film. Either way, I'm taking comfort in the fact that we probably will never see a movie like this again."

They seemed to be making a movie about trying to make a movie. It didn't come across to me as a real film.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch folks may have had a good idea, I honestly don't know, Maybe in their hearts and souls they thought what they had was a good idea; but they simply didn't have the skills to pull it off or to execute it well.<br/><br/>As with any other art form, freedom and spontaneity are all good and well, but they must be tempered with skill, control and compromise. This involves some mastery of the craft; many years of study and experience.

","(+SPOILERS+) Modern day horror story about a trio of college students Heather Donahue Michael Williams and Josh Leonard going into the woods outside of Burkittsville Maryland in October 1994 to do a documentary on the ""Blair Witch"". A ghost that has haunted those woods since the founding of the town of Burkittsville in 1810. <br/><br/>Supposedly desecrating an old Indian cemetery in the in the area by building the town there it's felt by the people who live in and around Burkittsville that the ""Blair Witch"" is responsible for a number of vicious and unexplained murders. The string of killings started in the late 1800's when five hunters were brutally murdered by the stream at Coffin Rock. The killings continued on intermittently up until the winter of 1940-41 with the murder of seven children at the old man Parr house. The children who were still alive were made to stand in a corner and wait their turn, looking at an empty wall, in order not to see Parr murdered the others. Parr was found to be insane but the people of the town feel that he was possessed by the ""Blair Witch"". <br/><br/>The three students drive out into the woods with their van and then take their video and living equipment in backpacks and go hiking out into the eerie forest. Nothing at first really happens to them until they pass by the haunted Coffin Rock. After a nights sleep in their tent the hikers find themselves in what is an old Indian cemetery with a number of rock piles as tombstones all around them. On their way back to their parked van the next night they hear strange noises all around their camp site and when they wake up the next morning they see the rock piles outside as if they were following them. Things become very weird where the three seem to be going around in circles and even worse Mike for some reason throws away the map that Heather had to help them find their way out of the woods. <br/><br/>After another harrowing night in the forest the hikers find themselves in an area of the woods with Voodoo like symbols and artifacts all over the trees! Panic starts to set in on the three hikers with Josh, not being able to take it anymore, going crazy and running out into the woods away from the other two hikers. Heather and Mike searching the woods, trying to find Josh, later that night hear faint cries coming from what turns out to be an old abandon house,The old Parr house?,in the woods. Mike going in first goes room to room trying to find Josh and finally realizes that the cries are coming from the basement and runs down there, just as the cries started they all of a sudden stop. <br/><br/>Heather screaming for Mike and Josh to answer her also runs down to the basement and then all we see from her video camera is Mike standing in the corner looking into a blank wall, like the children who were killed at the old man Parr house some sixty years ago! Terrified with fear we hear Heather give out an ear splitting cry and the camera falls out of her hand! All we can see from what the video camera recorded is an empty ceiling! Heather Mike and Josh were never seen or heard from again and all that was left of them was the video tapes that they made of their expedition in the woods that made up the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"". <br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is a lot like the movies directed by the late Jacques Tourneur like ""Cat People"" in 1942 and ""The Leopard Man"" in 1943 and later ""The Curse of the Demon"" in 1957. Tourneur used lights and sounds and shadows to scare the wits out of his audiences not special effects that were so used to seeing in horror movies now. <br/><br/>The the film has over 3,000 IMDb users comment on it as well as taking in over $140 million in domestic ticket sales during it initial release in the summer of 1999 shows the tremendous effect that it had on those who saw it. These two facts, among many others, shows that ""The Blair Witch Project"" made an impact on the movie going public far bigger than many of it's detractors would like us to believe."

The promotional gimmicking that Artisan did prior to release was a stroke of genius; unfortunately the movie did not live up to the hype. If you make an independent movie, at least have SOMETHING happen. The camera work was so deplorable even if there was SOMETHING there in the woods, you wouldn't have seen it anyhow. The acting was unbearable; the ending was non-climatic and made me realise that teenagers were actually PAYING money to see this uninspired piece of horse manure."
"Big Movie Fan","1","2","4","11 September 2002"," Absolutely Awful Rubbish
","Firstly, I am a fan of horror movies and I have no problem in suspending my disbelief and being scared by a movie. Over the years I've let myself be scared by movies such as Hellraiser, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill, The Changeling and many others.<br/><br/>This film however was totally rubbish. Okay, so you don't see the Blair Witch in it? The horror was supposed to be implied rather than shown. I don't have a problem with that. I prefer horror moves where the unseen is more scary but Blair Witch was rubbish.<br/><br/>The majority of the film was set in daylight and the characters stood swearing over their map. Any scenes that were set at night were rubbish. All you could hear was twigs snapping and leaves rustling. It didn't scare me and it didn't scare me when the young lady was sniffling at the end because she knew she was going to die. This movie was supposed to make people never want to go into the woods again. Well, as me and my girlfriend enjoy hiking, I can say that this movie did not put me off going into the woods unlike Jaws which put me off swimming for awhile. Nothing in this movie scared me. As for the camera work, the crew should have brought a tripod.<br/><br/>Another thing was that this movie was filmed documentary style. This made it no scarier. If you want to watch a horror movie filmed documentary style that is scary then I suggest the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Cannibal Holocaust.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was extremely bad and not at all scary unless you find the sounds of twigs snapping scary. This film was rubbish."

","When I saw this movie, in Rome at the Barberini Cinema the first weekend, there was almost a riot (whistles and yells from almost all young public). This movie is really disappointing (I`m polite). First, it`s not scary at all. The script wanted carefully to follow the rule `do not show the monster to be scary` but what it obtains is that it doesn`t show ANYTHING worth watching. Second, the interesting idea of the story is the part we all saw in the trailers and commercials. The story in the film adds a little more and not always unexpected: in conclusion BORING. Third, the camera work, in the attempt to appear `real`, is unpleasant (most scenes are shot while walking or running and this causes something like the sea-sickness). If I can forgive the neorealistic movies, the intellectual French movies, the Danish DOGMA movement for this is only because they can offer something back and the naive camera work adds something to the overall art of the movie. But here? <br/><br/>The post-movie question was: are we really all stupid to be cheated by a commercial? The answer was: yes. But only this time.<br/><br/>It`s another proof that a good (excellent) marketing is enough to make money in this business. Don`t waste your time and money watching this boring, useless, unneeded movie."

None of the people I saw it with were frightened, though we were almost made ill by the violent, jerking motions of the hand-held cameras.

This isn't a slasher film full of blood guts and gore, it's something entirely different, it's frightening. This movie relies on building bone chilling suspense that your own imagination supplies for you, probably more frightening than anything the movie industry could supply you with. You see everything the three film makers in the movie see and you hear what they hear and no more. What you don't see is always more frightening than what you do. It's the unknown that is terrifying and all through this movie you have to contend with the unknown. You never know what is going to happen next. You know that something will but never what. The only contrived aspect of this movie is that these three kids would continue to film through everything that they are experiencing. The movie does try and qualify this by having them explain how it makes them feel better seeing things through the camera's eye. Regardless of that, this is a must see movie."

Personally I really get-off on horror flicks, good bad or indifferent, and have watched pretty much every bloodletter made! (Still trying to figure out what was actually WORSE than I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER?) <br/><br/>Whom-soever was ""scared"" by this, has serious issues to deal with. Either that, or a rampantly manipulable imagination, one can only assume is totally at the mercy of repressed childish fantasy. My GOD - WHAT was scary? nothing happened! Its very amateurishness, far from compounding a fear-factor (though so many were taken in by critics worldwide SUGGESTING this be the case) served only to promote the ""home-movie"" status of the finished 'product'...and I use the term loosely!<br/><br/>Now I agree, knowing the fact that other horror flicks are actors, retracting knife blades, latex injuries and half empty bottles of ketchup, interacting before a camera, FOR THE MOST part renders the shudder content (for any thinking person at least) to negative levels. So what's different here? Ok, you got no color, no ketchup...a LOT of trees and no-one can act!

","I have often wondered whether I would have been more frightened if I had seen Silence of the Lambs on a full screen rather than on TV, but in any event I was somewhat scared by it (actually, more like shocked, not really frightened).  And I was frightened by The Exorcist the first time I saw it, but sort of laughed later at some of the scenes, altho I think it was good. But I was not frightened by this idiotic, silly, and literally vacuous movie that I saw on a full screen.<br/><br/>One thing I do not like in a movie is for nothing to happen, and this is certainly in spades here. Those who are familiar with Cannibal Holocaust know the camera and no faces (and journey into woods/jungle) were not a new idea, and, still, in that movie that was only a partial effect and you saw most of the characters most of the time (I think faces and bodies -- at least some -- are important for a movie).  Of course, the characters in Blair Witch were such idiots that it is hardly worth knowing them; the men were jerks and the woman was a complaining and screaming (pun intended) loser.  All the interplay between the three was nothing but stupid; it is fitting they lost the map.  And the character development was limited to what we had here?<br/><br/>My comment about nothing happening's being an albatross rings particularly true with a ""horror"" film.  If I admit, having not been frightened by the tree etc. events throughout the movie, that I was slightly frightened at the end, so what?

Instead, they get lost.  They wander around.  They wander around some more.  They scream, yell, and curse at each other.  They act like idiots.<br/><br/>And, of course, they KEEP FILMING through all this, as I'm sure any three smart people would, because we all know that filming yourself getting lost is far more important than getting back to civilization.<br/><br/>Eventually some weird stuff happens.  We don't know exactly what because nobody bothers to tell us.  Is it scary?  Well, I was kind of afraid that the herky-jerky camera motion would make me vomit in the theater, but other than that the film that TV promos called the ""scariest movie since The Exorcist"" didn't have one scary moment.<br/><br/>I've heard it said that the filmmakers wanted to scare us by purposely not showing us everything.  Fine, but even if you don't show everything, you still have to show enough.  Take the movie ""Seven"".  You don't see the actual murders committed by John Doe, but by showing you the bodies and murder scenes, the director forces you to imagine their brutality.  ""Blair Witch"" doesn't give you any clue what's going on.  The only thing I was led to imagine during this movie was how else I could have spent 80 minutes."

","Here's why so many people bashed this movie, claiming that it was boring, stupid, and bad.<br/><br/>These people either have absolutely no imagination or have it and are just afraid to use it because *gasp* they might sound a little unique.<br/><br/>I am not going to say that `The Blair Witch Project' was a brilliant film with impeccable actors and genius film makers because its not, but I'll you what it is: Its quite possibly the most artistically creative film of 1999. So many people reacted to this film claiming it was `unscary' and `boring' that it just makes me sad. Sad when I think about how shallow most of today's society is. The fact that many claimed that why they didn't like the film is because it never showed anything, only sounds in the dark, shows that most movie-goers just want to sit in movie theaters with empty minds, not thinking, not wanting to think, with the last thing on their `To Do' lists is to use their imagination. Then they look upon the movie as retarded, even though, for the past two hours, they looked like insipid vegetables.<br/><br/>Another complaint that many people use is that the actors used to many profane words and the amount of the bonafide `f**k' is used quite excessively. Now what moviegoers have to do is put themselves in the shoes of the three kids. In the words of Joshua Leonard.... `You're lost, you're angry in the woods, and no one is here to help you. There's a witch and she keeps leaving s*** outside your door. There's no one here to help you!' I found that this one quote pretty much summed it all up, exposing why the three of them begin to `lose' it.<br/><br/>It is unsettling when a small, $35,000, independent film like this can be nearly 20 (in fact, more like 30) times as scary as something like 1998's `Urban Legends,' which cost nearly forty times as much to make. I will safely say with much confidence that really the main reason that so many people didn't like this movie was because of the hype. Independent films have a long tradition of being self-reliant (in other words, independent) and avoid all of the mainstream hype. That was the one factor that kept it from being a genuine independent film. Nonetheless, it is nothing short of being extraordinarily innovative and one of the top ten scariest films of the nineties. 8/10<br/><br/>One side note: The sequel, `Book Of Shadows,' stands against everything that the first one stood for. I do not suggest it."

To finish this criticism off of The Blair Witch horror movies should contain gore and murder to scare this one falls way short.

By the end I was cheering the evil spirits along and wishing they would hurry up and do their job.<br/><br/>Bad acting, worse story.  It's not scary or original.

","I've loved horror films ever since I was a little boy.  I adored anything which starred Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney or Lon Chaney Jr., or any of the other horror greats from my childhood.  I later loved Dark Shadows, Night Gallery, and Alfred Hitchcock.  I've never enjoyed ""splatter"" films, although I consider the first Halloween to be a minor masterpiece.<br/><br/>However, I've seen only two films in my lifetime which actually scared me, and those were The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., and the Seven Faces of Dr. Lao. I don't know why they frightened my little-boy self, but they did.<br/><br/>Blair Witch was so unhorrifying that I thought at first that those who expressed fright were pulling my leg.  I didn't need to be told that it was a fake; apart from the fact that the F.B.I. would have confiscated the film, and the murders would have been famous, the public outcry of a filmed murder would have been as enormous as if a snuff film had been released.  That, and the fact that there are no witches, and never have been (the claims of wiccans and neo-pagans aside), totally devalues the film.<br/><br/>Remember that Dracula and Frankenstein were fictions that were presented as such, so the standards of judging them are different.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll confess that I found Jaws equally boring.  No, I'm not jaded, but Blair Witch never once induced the willing suspension of disbelief necessary for a horror film (or any other) to work.<br/><br/>All in all, the biggest cinematic let-down I have ever experienced."

"skoll","Null","2","4","17 March 2000"," Lost in the woods
","I don't like slasher movies.  They depend on the characters behaving stupidly.  BWP is not a slasher movie but still its characters had to behaved stupidly for the story to proceed.<br/><br/>Gore in slasher movies is shock used to make up for a lack of skill in creating suspense on the part of the film maker.  BWP used gimmicks; shaky camera work, irritating actors and a fore-shadowing pre-amble.<br/><br/>
I was lost in the woods of Michigan twice when I was a child.  Once when five, once when nine.  The woods of Michigan look very much like the woods of Maryland, as depicted in BWP.  But even at the age of five, lost and alone in a place I had never been before, I did not behave as these three young adults (one of whom liked hiking) behaved.<br/><br/>Not everyone gets lost in the woods.  Not everyone investigates witch legends.  But most everyone takes showers, which is why Psycho is so effective.  You can relate to it.  You make yourself vulnerable every time you step under that water.  It could happen to you.  That's why it's terrifying.<br/><br/>So, if you want terror watch ""In Cold Blood.""  It will hit you where you live.  If you want horror see the Dutch film from the 30s, ""Vampyre.""  It will hit you where you sleep.<br/><br/>It is true that what you imagine is much worse than anything a film maker can put on screen (the off-screen murder of the child in Fritz Lang's ""M"" for instance).  And, like what happens in Room 101 in Orwell's ""Nineteen Eight-four,""  what terrifies each of us is different.<br/><br/>Horror IS in the mind, but it's not in The Blair Witch Project. To me BWP is not a scary movie, nor is it frightening.  It is unrealized potential.  A brilliant concept squandered due to lack skill on the part of the film makers.<br/><br/>And there's two more coming.  Now that's terrifying."

I was really in the mood for a chill when I began watching BWP, but I soon started yawning. And there was no turning point, it just got worse and worse!  <br/><br/>First of all, what's the point with this movie? To scare, would be the only possible answer (apart from making dollars). Well, I wasn't the least scared more than a few moments. The rest of the time was just a plain bore, and the climax of the movie is actually a big anticlimax. What about the script? Was there one, or was everything made up as they shot the movie? The lines were certainly not believable, and the actors didn't add anything to their roles. No soundtrack deepened the atmosphere, and the visuals were uninspiring; how many minutes of the movie were completely dark? <br/><br/>Actually, I can't find one good thing to say about BWP, and that doesn't happen to me often. Even the Critters are more scary. This is a dull, tedious and unimaginative movie that should be avoided at all cost."

","I'm not a fan of horror films at all, probably because they don't impress me. Oh sure, their special effects tend to go ""gross out"" and all, and they get a reaction from me, but as far as I'm concerned being grossed out is not the same thing as being terrified. Just because something looks or acts disgusting doesn't mean it frightens me. And to be frank, I've grown bored with the constant parade of ""horror"" movies coming out these days, and not just because I don't care for them... also because they don't frighten me. Enter THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the first movie I've ever seen which terrified me so badly that I was unable to sleep for four nights! (It doesn't help that my apartment is currently in a cellar. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.) This is a movie for, say, computer game fans who prefer thinking games to arcade style games, THIEF as opposed to QUAKE. This is very much a thinking person's movie, and those who (I hate to say it) don't have much imagination will get precious little out of it because they are the types who need to have their visuals spoonfed to them. I did have a few complaints about the film, but many were answered in the info provided by www.blairwitch.com. **The following are considered spoilers, if you prefer to see the film without knowing any background info first, please stop reading.** For example, I kept wondering why no one tried using any of the techniques of that ""lost in the woods"" book that was brought along. But then, I went to the webpage and read the personal diary that was there which said things like (paraphrased), ""Why can't I remember what I'm supposed to do after reading it so much in that book? Why isn't our compass working?"" The suggestion is that they've been put until a spell by the Blair Witch, and that it's slowly eating away at their logic...and maybe even screwing around with their compass? The only part which still makes me jump a little bit with suspicion is the idea of carrying the cameras and filming everything all the way to the very end of the film. While this is soothed a bit by the fact that the webpage's diary says (paraphrased again), ""I'm going to film everything that happens, so hopefully some good will come out of this..."" so it can be argued that the characters continued doing so in case they felt they'd need the filmed information in the future, I can't help but wish that, say, they had been equipped with those special cameras that mounts on one's head so they could have an excuse to forget the cameras were still rolling while everything was happening. That's the only slight damper on what is otherwise a brilliant film, and I for one am willing to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy such a great movie. It may very well become at this rate the only scary movie I would ever actually BUY."

About half way through, bored out of my mind, I not only was rooting for the witch, but feeling aggressive myself.  If there had been ""kill Heather"" or ""kill Josh"" buttons to push on my VCR, I would have punched them without an ounce of regret.<br/><br/>The only good things going for Blair Witch is that it would be fairly creative for a high school class project (if it were one) and that it attempts to create suspense without all kinds of overblown special effects. Still, if the writers/directors/etc. had read an article or a book on how to create horror/suspense, they would have developed characters with which the audience could identify (I hate to think about who DOES identify with this bunch) and who have more of a personal stake in finding out about the legend of the witch.  <br/><br/>If you're really curious, rent this for 99 cents like I did -- though you may still feel cheated."

Slap together a film made on really poor home cameras with no soundtrack, no proper editing, no post-production and the flimsiest of plots and convince everyone that this is the cool way to make movies and you have The Blair Witch Project.  If you can sit through the jerky pictures until the end you will be rewarded with one of the greatest anti-climaxes in cinema history. If however you are a fan of first year film study drop outs' attempts at suspense then this one's for you."

","I watched 'The Blair Witch Project' in a crowded cinema. At the end of the movie the audience sat for a moment in stunned silence not because they were scared to move but simply in the sudden realization that they had been victims of a massive marketing con-trick. In years to come people will remember how they were taken in by all the hype while the reviewers who hailed the movie as 'genuinely frightening and disturbing' will hang their heads in shameful embarrassment at the memory of how they were so easily duped. OK so the movie was 'original' but even an 'original' horror film should make you jump or at least leave you feeling uneasy. Does anyone really care what happens to these obnoxious, foul-mouthed young people. I was hoping the girl who led the expedition would be bumped off as quickly as possible, so that my ears could be spared her ranting. And are we seriously expected to believe that she would just carry on filming despite being scared to death and in a state of complete panic? The makers of this movie must be laughing all the way to the bank. If ever there was a case of 'The Emperor's New Clothes', this was it!!"

","Saw TBWP opening day in Seattle WA, and was Blown away. The film has a way of drawing you into the group; making you feel as if you are lost in the woods with them. Heather, Josh and mike seem like old friends.. friends whom are lost, hunted and traumatized.  There is a feeling of claustrophobic anxiety that builds with each scene. You want them to escape the woods but you know they are doomed. Finally, in the final scenes, claustrophobia explodes into out-right terror..  the best terror I've ever experienced in a movie theatre.<br/><br/>Blair Witch is both horrifying and heartbreaking.. For two days now I've felt like I'm mourning lost friends who died mysteriously, even though I was there to see their 'end.' This is only possible because of the films total believablity.

It was the thought of not seeing the witch that scared me most. It sent shivers down my spine. I watch a lot of scary movies, they're my favorite, and out of all that I have watched I'd have to say that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was the BEST! It kept me wondering. I thought that all the actors in this film were really good. The way they expressed their anger and fears to one another seemed real, like they were actually being scared to death. To those who have not seen this movie, make sure that you watch the beginning. If not, then you won't get the movie. The beginning tells you about the things that the Blair witch has done to others and explains the events that happen later in the movie. If you don't see this part you will become confused!

So these three people go to the woods and basically through the entire movie they run arround and are confronted with the paralyzing fright of twigs! Its like watching three mice looking for the cheese at the end of a maze. If these three truly believe that there is an old hairy witch out to kill them wouldn't the obvious decision be to go after her? I mean there are 3 of you. Those are pretty good odds.

","This is real terror. There is nothing worse than the sensation of loneliness and confusion in our minds. If you concentrate, and believe you are one of the kids, you'll be scared to death. If you expect an idiot, but brave main character, who screams a lot, but is able to kick the stupid murderer, go watch SCREAM, or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. They have plots like: ""You ran over me! Die!"". The Blair Witch Project is so much different than that! It takes three typical youngs, used to good life, and with the normal teenager sensation of omnipotence, to the woods. At the beginning, everything seems so funny and happy, but as the time goes by, they realise they are not as powerful or smart as they thought, and that their hope is giving place to insanity.<br/><br/>People complain about Heather's screaming. What is she supposed to do? Scream once and be quiet while something is after her? I surely wouldn't be calm. Other people say ""piles of rocks are not scary"". NO? How about finding these piles after all you've passed the last night, living in a city where the Blair Witch Tale frightens the citizens for ages? I would feel scared to death. People who say this film are as dumb as the kids IN the movie. They think that they could handle the situation easily, and that what they've passed is nothing... Well, I doubt you can go camping after seeing this movie with attention... Remember: This movie is for people with imagination, with good taste and with sensibility for other people's feelings.

I knew it was fake yet because of the way they presented the film, it was like I instantly adjusted to it and felt that it was as real as ordinary life.  It doesnt matter what I or you think about this film.  Everyone who saw this film reacted differently and it will be appreciated by some and hated by some.  So if you like it, great!  If you didnt, sorry you were disappointed.

","Having already posted one review which could be seen as being ""negative"" (although not as much as many of the reviews here) I have become rather resentful at those who not only praise the film (to each his own) but also offer their interpretation as to why the rest of don't like it - because it lacks special effects and relies on our imagination which therefore must be lacking.<br/><br/>As for the first, Sixth Sense was plenty scary without special effects.  I can enjoy a non-effect movie as long as there is something compelling going on.  Blair Witch was interesting but hardly compelling, and effects or not, there was *nothing* scary.  Not a single solitary moment of the film caused me to jump in my seat, to look over my shoulder or to instill a fear in me that wasn't already there.  Silence of the Lambs lacks special effects and except for a scene or two, doesn't have ""jump out at you"" scares yet is widely considered one of the scariest movies ever.  Why?  Because the audience is given just enough info to truly be frightened by the possibilities and the knowledge that something real is behind it all.  Blair Witch gives some hints of things to be frightened of, but nothing to indicate that something truly malevolent is taking place. <br/><br/>
As for the second.  My imagination is fine.  I'm a filmmaker myself.  When I go to a film I go to become involved in the filmmaker's imagination.  If the whole point of the film was simply to be scared by what I can imagine, why go to the movie?  I can sit at home and imagine some pretty scary stuff without spending $4.50.  ""Jaws"" left alot to the imagination but it also gave me enough to go on to fuel my imagination.  Blair Witch gave me nothing.  Not a hint, not a glimpse.  For all I know, the whole thing was a practical joke played on them by Mike, the movie not only doesn't offer any explanations it doesn't even offer any clues (and yes I know what the ending was supposed to be and that was hardly enough to validate any explanation from aliens to a ticked-off hermit).  I am left thinking that the filmmakers had nothing scary in mind... that it was their imagination that was lacking, not mine.  That they couldn't think of something sufficiently scary to match the build up so instead of going for the big climax, they just end it and then say ""imagine something scary here""  That's not filmmaking genius, that's a cop-out.  If Speilburg had *never* showed us the shark and instead left the possibility open that it wasn't a shark but perhaps a big p-o'd goldfish or maybe just a maniacal scuba diver or maybe (insert something you think is scary here) people would have been upset too.  Movie scares require something concrete to scare me.  There was nothing concrete in Blair Witch. The sticks & rocks set up a creepy atmosphere but are not scary by themselves. <br/><br/>I have no problem with a movie that doesn't draw a straight line for me, that doesn't make all the connections explicit (Eyes Wide Shut for instance which requires active thought on the part of viewer and was thus not understood by most people) but if I'm to be left to connect the dots myself, you'd better at least give me the dots.<br/><br/>If this film scared you, fine.  But for me it didn't and the film's supporters attempts to explain why it didn't scare me (usually in an insulting manner) simply don't hold water."

","It is probably the most widely seen film that is in full found footage style, the style to pretend as if the event was accidentally recorded by the people involved, and later it was discovered by others.<br/><br/>I imagine it must have been quite baffling experience for the audience in the theater at the time of its original release. How did they feel when the grainy amateur-quality footage was on the big screen and it contined for over 80 minutes?<br/><br/>The plot is typical for horror movies. The main characters violate a taboo by intruding a forbbiden area only for their whimsical activity. We already know the result; they disappeared, probably died. Our interest is about how it happened.<br/><br/>As they proceed into the woods, the mood is getting darker and darker, and they are gradually realising it has become too dangerous to enjoy thrill as they expected. They are encountering eerie stuff like cairns and stick figures. Tension between the three is rising. We see all the changes of situation through the two cameras. They are getting shaky and unstable, reflecting the holders' emotional state.<br/><br/>At a first glance it may look like a tasteless jump scare film. But if you follow Heather's emotion, it turns out to be a story of regret and guilt. It culminates with the iconic close-up shot near the ending. I think it is very sincere and touching."

There have been plenty of thoughtful reviews, so I'll leave one idea that I've grown to appreciate over the years.<br/><br/>There is a meta theme, raised when the documentary director is challenged for hiding behind the camera: she uses it to filter reality. This is reinforced with her handling of the map even as the crew becomes hopelessly lost. The thought that springs to mind: ""The map is not the territory"" - life is not what you expected. Even in the final scene the theme comes through, where the camera belongs to the director, yet her voice is distant - who is behind the camera? That gap within reality gives us a dark and spooky depth.<br/><br/>A final point - the tension is largely created by the distress in the voices of the victims.

","This film is unique. It has a wonderful realism caused by fine acting and the filming style (everything is filmed by the actors using two cameras in a documentary style) There are no special effects of any sort. It is quite spectacular to have a film with such an openness that requires raw talent in this age. The acting is flawless: the actors come off completely naturally. <br/><br/>However, the only way I could find myself getting scared was if I tried to imagine it actually WAS real. That way, the noises in the night (literally) could be genuinely invasive and haunting. Yet, because I never saw anything, or heard anything apart from the screams from Josh, it was difficult for me to feel any terror. The figures and rocks that appeared out of nowhere in the mornings were a fantastic idea and, again, the reaction from the actors is flawless. Personally, because there were no actual jump scares or any recorded contact with the Witch for that matter, I didn't find it scary. It places ideas in the mind and leaves a lot to the imagination; I found that I needed more. This film simply is not for me regarding scare-factor, because of it's nature.

","The Blair Witch Project (1999) is a movie that ultimately changed films that followed. It is about 3 students who embark on an adventure searching for the ""Blair Witch"". On their journey, they manage to get lost, leading to questionable events, leaving the audience biting their nails. Throughout the whole film, there are no actual jump scares or gruesome scenes which leads me to believe that this film was meant to built suspense. When following these students on their journey, the audience watches them struggle and sees them reach the point of insanity. In the end of the movie, Mike is facing a corner because earlier in the film they interviewed local civilians and one mentioned that the ""Blair Witch"" puts one person facing a corner while it kills the other. This means that the witch had put Mike in the corner and was in the middle of killing Josh, when the camera was knocked to the floor leaving the ending open for debate. I found this movie to be neither the best or over hyped. The movie's idea behind creating a realistic feeling to the footage and having the characters filming was amazing and was the first of its time. All the hype around the movie is well deserved as it was entertaining throughout the whole movie. After the filming ends, the audience is left in the air with all sorts of theories of what happens to the students. There is no definite answer of what happens after which is why this movie has managed to entertain people nearly 20 years after being released. I would definitely recommend this movie to others as it is a great way to break the ice and start a discussion."

","When watching the Blair witch project I always seemed to be in one of two positions; on the edge of my seat or with my hand clasped on my mouth not in fear but with a sympathy for the inevitability of their demise and for this reason I would say this movie is a master at suspense not horror. Near the end we see mike facing the corner in what was essentially the last shot of the film. To me this represents not necessarily the control the supposed witch has in the film but him turning his back on Heather and resigning to his fate. A lot of people and media outlets claim this is one of if not the best horror movies of all time, I can't really say I agree with that statement as I am not as learned in horror movies as most but I can say the overwhelming hype for this movie is a little undeserved. While it is good at certain things like suspense the Blair witch project doesn't stand alone as a movie per say. This is mainly because the majority of the movie is focused on arguments and the characters going round in circles both in conversation and in physically accidentally retracing their steps. For this reason I would give it a 6.5/10. I think this especially when I consider the most interesting part of the movie is what happens after the cameras stop rolling around the end. I'm not usually one for tin foil hat thermos but I was curious, so I looked one up after the movie and ended up buying into one. Long story short he showed a variety of different evidence that pointed to the truth that Josh and Mike had planned the whole thing as an elaborate way of killing Heather. It's eerie how many subtle details you don't notice while watching the movie points to this theory being true so I believe that after the camera drops Heather is killed by the two boys."

","The Blair Witch Project is a 1999 American movie based on a true story. It is about three young students; Heather, Josh and Mike, who get lost in a woods while they are doing a project on the Blair Witch. They spend a week asking questions about the witch and the related legend, then they go into the woods. They are supposed to spend two days there, but they get lost, and strange things begin to occur. As the movie goes on, tension rises, reaching the highest point when the guys find a house hidden in the trees. There, what told by the legend we heard about at the beginning happens. Mike faces the wall, so we know that Josh is already dead, Mike is going to be killed, and Heater is going to be the next one.  Even though the killing of the guys isn't shown, the end of the movie is pretty clear. The movie is a psychological horror based on the recovered footage discovered a year later after the guys' disappeared. You really become involved with it; knowing that you are watching what those guys were filming makes you feel their emotions. It scares you because you can feel the real fear. Their acting is very realistic and the use of cameras is interesting and compelling. It is not a usual horror movie, but it is still fascinating. It can be considered boring because not much happens, however I think it does catch your interest till the end. It is probably not the best movie in this genre, but it is definitely a film worth watching."

","Sometimes a great creepy horror movie, doesn't need crazy special effects or well calculated jump scares, sometimes all it takes is simple story and creepy atmosphere. The Blair Witch Project is possibly the most brilliantly marketed film of all time. The public was attracted to the ambiguity of the film trailer and website, as well as the insisting notion that the events occurred were in fact real. The film also revolutionized how many horror films slash their budget by going to hand-held cameras. It's never an ideal way of film-making,some movies can pull off a shaky camera, some can't, however the Blair Witch Project absolutely does. The big bug-ab-boo is the acting and dialogue are extremely monotonous. Characters are also unlikable at times.

","This movie is a low budget classic and is going to be an ideal model for future found footage movies. Camera work and Acting is realistic. This movie is a slow burn without much scary elements or jump scares. It is not for everyone, but still it does a good job in conveying the deep horror of being lost in the woods and being terrorized by demonic entities. This movie laid a foundation for future found footage movies and is definitely worth a watch."

","I really like how this movie starts. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez did a good job with the realization of characters. Then providing us this absence of horror, adding some ""heyyahs"" in there. The town folk all seem out of there minds, circus-like, and seem to all know important facts about the ""The Blair Witch Project."" One guys says that a lot of people say the woods are ""all haunted,"" then takes it back and says there not. The part about the camera and how it works was a great add on. I like how they are all friends, too.   I'm just picturing these students getting together and saying, ""you guys want to go to the woods and make a really cool film."" The way this film starts out really makes the film fun and interesting. I know I already said that, but it does. It has a very simple compositional-style and flow too. Everyone is lost in this film, unfortunately, and cannot be found. - Because they were lost before, and now they decided to make a documentary about a WITCH.  Think of the joy of being in a really cool film, lol. Hell, I would have liked to do this project with them. And, I like how the light in this film bounces off things such as, the suns rays. Heather has a good voice for the main narrator of the project. Her take is, ""I don't know"" when asked if the witch exists. She is like the facilitator of a stupidity. The map adds a great conflict piece, a disappointment. I mean could this film be better? could it be set in a mental asylum? Myrick and Sanchez decide to add some good ideas in this film, like the rock piles, her puppy dog beanie, colors of the tent. You sense the discomfort of the actors. They should've brought some broccoli along. These people are film students, but did their teacher assign them to this group, or do these people randomly know each other? Do we actually get to see them light a fire? Just like we don't actually see what Heather sees. The film draws good comparisons to insanity vs. feeling fatigued in the woods, all while disorientation is setting in. Heather says that ""movies are all she has left."" So, we wonder what happened to her art before? We are not sure what is wrapped in the bundle wrapped with Josh's necklace. So the film end when Heather is knocked out by something we never get to see. We know that two cameras must have been recovered. Great found footage type film."

","The Blair Witch Project (1999): Dir: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez / Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard, Sandra Sanchez, Jim King: Independent horror film that received about the best marketing a film could ask for. Three students undergo a project on the legendary Blair Witch. Locals describe the Blair Witch killing several children in the deep woods. Filming begins with fun but each night grows darker until they awake with bizarre happenings. Great premise shot in camcorder so that viewers can experience the film as the characters do. Effective with tension building but the ending is too abrupt. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who give it a documentary appeal although the shaky camera movements are distracting. Absorbing performances by Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. Donahue gives an emotional confession to the camera with that eerie flashlight. The locals being interviewed in the opening needed more screen time just based on humour. The ending leaves viewers a bit confused. One of the boys goes missing and the remaining two panic. When we finally do see him it is not clear what is happening. Upholds the idea of fear being something we cannot see. Some of the dark lighting could have been edited out particularly when it is pitch black and nothing is happening, but it is still shocking independent film work. Score: 7 ½ / 10"
"Rickting","5","0","0","14 January 2014"," Important but over-hyped
","The Blair Witch Project is considered to be a landmark in horror history and terrified everyone back in 1999. Why exactly? This is the first found footage horror film (The first to exclusively use the format) and 3 annoying teenagers go into the woods to film a documentary, get lost and are hunted by the Blair Witch. That's all there is to it. I'm sick and tired of found footage as it's just a way to make money without actually scaring anyone. Troll Hunter, Cloverfield or the excellent Chronicle are all smart examples which use the format well, and this shows in other genres found footage can work. I still can't stand those stupid Paranormal Activity films though. However, at the time, this movie would have been very scary and boosted by a good marketing campaign. It's still scary today. For about 5 minutes. More an experiment than a movie, this is a very interesting film but it's became cool to hate for good reason. It's not a bad film like some say, but it's certainly not a great movie.<br/><br/>The film has many assets. The finale at the house is very suspenseful, the way the film never shows the witch is very good as well and what people often forget is the acting is actually good (Heather Whatshername didn't deserve that Razzie) and the film creates a sense of unease and fear. But that doesn't mean it's scary. It's unnerving, patient and unique but it's about as scary as a walk in the park most of the time. Overly minimalistic, underwhelming, full of stupid decisions and deeply, deeply boring, this is one film you should never watch more than once even if you liked it the first time. There are only so many times one can stare at trees, tents being shaken and listen to weird noises before they just start to get annoyed. It's not a bad movie, just a remarkably average one hyped to absurd levels. It had a big impact at the time, but having seen many other superior horror films TBWP feels woefully unscary.<br/><br/>5/10"
"Delerium","Null","0","0","8 August 1999"," A Landmark Horror Film,
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a rare gem, a psychological horror film with no big budget, no big name actors, and no in-your-face special effects, and it is better than almost every summer movie possessing all of the above. The hype might be killing it for some viewers, but it certainly is every bit as scary as people are saying. <br/><br/>Three student film makers set out to make a documentary on a local myth, the so-called ""Blair Witch"". Their starting point is interviewing people about the myths and legends that surround the supposedly haunted woods near a small town in Maryland. They interview many people who tell stories about the troubled past, with a crazy person (or thing) stalking the woods, child murders, and the fact that the woods are haunted to this day. The film makers treat these tales like myths, nothing to be taken seriously. But as they get deeper into ther filming, they discover something is really out there. Soon, they find themselves lost and running out of food, and patients with each other. <br/><br/>Because the film is shot in a documentary style, every event is a suprise. You are discovering these horrors as the characters are discovering it. But in ""The Blair Witch Project"", there is no hockey masked killer staking them, no demon roaming around, the horror is all psychological. That is what makes this movie so scary, it feeds off of our own sense of fear. The scenario is our own worst nightmare, being lost in the vast woods with images of wicked witches and ghosts, or possible something worse going through out heads. And as the movie goes on, the sense of sheer hopelessness and fear rubs right off on the audience. By the end of the movie, I was totally unnerved. One thing that should also get special mention is the writing. The screenwriters did a great job of giving the characters a realistic touch. They talk like normal people rather than fabricated cartoon characters all too common in movies these days. <br/><br/>One warning, and this has been stated numerous times, if you are going to see this movie, avoid the first 5 rows. The camera shakes and shifts so much that is causes motion sickness. To add the the horror of the movie, there was a sick feeling growing in the pit of my stomach. Or is that supposed to be part of the experience. <br/><br/>Most people expect that ""The Blair Witch Project"" to spawn a whole score of cheap knockoffs, and will be used as a reference point for modern horror movies, much like ""Halloween"" spawned ""Friday the 13th"" and a never ending list of  slasher films. I hope that is not true, because ""Blair Witch"" is proof that a great movie doesn't need the Hollywood treatment to be quality and successful at the same time. This is how horror movie should be."

","I used to be quite afraid of the dark.  I was afraid of what might be lurking in its depth.  Sometimes I would let my imagination run and let it dream up that unseen terror.  I can't remember what all I conjured up in my imagination, but I can remember how scared I had made myself.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project did an effective job of tapping into this realm of my psyche.  It gave me a place to contemplate and imagine what was so terrifying out there in the darkness, to imagine what would be so frightening to me.  It gave me everything to do this - the situation, the setting, the myth, people whose mental state I can understand, the noises in the night, and of course, the dark.  It gave me everything except the visualization of the horror and left room for me to imagine it.  It didn't visually show me, but gave me all the tools to dream up that which scares me the most.  And that is truly frightening.<br/><br/>What is the scariest thing you can think of?  I would venture to say everyone would have a different answer.  The Blair Witch Project doesn't try to paint it for you, but instead hands you the palette and brush.  Those who take and use the brush will have the most fun and scare out of this movie."

The only scare I received was when I look at my wrist to find I had left my watch at home and had no idea how much more of this boring movie I had left to sit through. Don't get me wrong, I really like the idea of this movie. I also like the way it was shot and especially the sound. Here's the problem with this film. Almost nothing happens in the first hour. We see three people that we know nothing about and thus care not about bicker and argue about being lost in the woods. My interest was totally lost when we find that the missing map was kicked down a stream and not snatched by mysterious forces. Maybe if these three lost filmmakers had thought of following the stream they might have gotten out of the woods. I wish I had a stream to get me out of the theater earlier. Of course that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."

","Shortly after this movie began, an annoying group of people entered the theater, sat down behind me, and started eating popcorn noisily.  They had a young child with them and deep down inside I hoped that the constantly whispering whelp would be traumatized by the much hyped fear-inducing power of this film.  Well, it didn't happen.  I moved so as not to hear the kid, but unless she was paralyzed with fear and was carried out on a stretcher without me realizing it (and that's not likely because her noisy folks would have talked about it) the movie had no appreciable impact on her.  A movie can't be the scariest movie ever made if it can't traumatize a young kid!  <br/><br/>
The movie had no great impact on me either. I salute the concept and the risk, but it just wasn't all that scary.  Creepy maybe.  I did get goosebumps a few times, which is what the best ghost stories should give. But the movie takes way too long to gear up and when it does, the fear is not sustained. Also, I had trouble caring about the characters after a while.    <br/><br/>Once again, I'll caution you about seeing preview materials.  The Sci-Fi Channel special is interesting.  In fact, I like it better than the film, which is the problem.  If you do see the movie, go in with as little information as possible, then unravel the mystery for yourself.  That's where I think the fun in this film could be."

We've heard scarier stories at slumber parties and boy scout camp fires when we were 10 years old, and those stories were scary without a constant barrage of foul language. It seemed as though the film makers thought the audience needed to hear a certain four-letter word at least 100 times to be convinced that the characters were scared.  Sorry, but the limited vocabulary really reflects a lack of creativity and makes young people look like idiots. Read ""Hansel and Gretel""; it's more frightening than this waste of time and money."
"Harry-115","6","0","0","5 August 1999"," Outstanding indie, but doesn't live up to the hype...
","This is a very good indie feature. It accomplishes what Hollywood is having a hard time doing (producing a genuinely creepy movie), and because it's making tens of millions, it will be analyzed to death, and elements from it will be recycled for years to come.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie uses numerous means to manipulate the audience into feeling major anxiety - not the least of which is the jerky handi-cam shooting which can cause mild motion sickness. Once we're physically distressed, it's easier to work on our minds with the creepy bump-in-the-night psych. Very cool.<br/><br/>Now, it's fine for an indie to be a one-trick pony, but this is not what I expect for seven bucks, so I hope the majors are taking notes (Spoilers ahead):<br/><br/>More character development. Dump the stereotypical teenage arguing, high pitched whining and constant swearing - please! I'm not offended by language, but it gets old.<br/><br/>Giving the audience credit for imagination is the best way to get scares, but hey, throw us a visual bone... a blur, a shadow, a distortion, a bush rustling, SOMETHING.<br/><br/>The end was shocking in its abruptness, but I wouldn't have changed that. I do agree with a previous poster that there should have been wrapup... ""stock"" news footage of the house, and reporters interviewing people after the cameras and films were found (like in the newer TV trailers). The ending credits hit most of us in the face like a bucket of cold water, and there were groans all around in a theatre filled with teens and twenty-somethings."

I am not going to give anything away in this review but I just don't want people to have any misconceptions going into it.  I am one of the most easily scared people I know (""Jurassic Park"" made me cry and hide my head in my lap) but all through this movie I kept thinking, ""this isn't very scary at all.""  It almost ruined the movie for me because I kept wanting it to be scarier than it was.  I think that people should not go in to it expecting a typical thrills/chills type horror movie because they will probably be disappointed.  I would still recommend this movie, though, because it is an interesting movie to see and I appreciate this type of novelty in film making and believe that it should be encouraged.  And even though it wasn't really scary, it did affect me.  I find myself still thinking about it days afterwards and I don't think that I will go camping any time soon.

","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this unsettling, eerie film so much that I hope to see it for a second time soon.  The absence of Hollywood glitz and special effects (so prevalent in genre films these days) only added to the chilling atmosphere that increasingly pervades this film.  It gave me what I like to call a ""good scare"" (as opposed to a bad, gross-out scare) and yes, I did think about it that night when turning out the lights and trying to go to sleep.  The humour in the film, which some found distracting and ""not scary"", to me only made it more convincing.  The juxtaposition of the ""domestic scene"" (Heather mending her pants while they are talking about mashed potatoes) with the disappearance of Josh shortly thereafter was super creepy - and all good horror movies (to me) always give us those moments that feel safe just before something hellish occurs.  The build-up was maintained to the end - in fact the climax was really that final scene - something difficult for filmmakers to accomplish I feel.  The great outdoor setting, with all the leaves on the ground (sometimes looking like skulls or bones, if you have an overactive imagination) made me glad I was not leaving for a long hiking trip the following day.  There were lots of good touches in this film that made it work, too many for me to list, which is why I want to see it a second time.

","Go see this movie and oh, by the way, bring your cross, Bible or whatever your representation of what keeps you safe in this crazy world happens to be.<br/><br/>This is a great movie in spite of (because of?) the budget.  It is simple and I think that's the reason it makes for a great story.  Horror, true horror is simple.  Nothing to distract you from what's happening and in this case, the filmmakers have excelled.<br/><br/>I'm sure by now you all have heard, read or seen the basic premise of the movie which is (bear with me :) the story of three film college students wandering off into the Black Hills of Maryland in search of the mythical Blair Witch named after the town which bears the heavy burden of being the witch's primary target.  These three disappear, never to be seen again in spite of 33000 man-hours of searching and then a year later, their footage is recovered.<br/><br/>The movie opens up with the kids in happier times, excited at the prospect of making a ""kick-ass"" movie.  In high spirits, they take off into the dense forest armed with their video cameras and the usual accoutrements of camping: a book entitled ""How to Survive in the Woods"", compasses and a map. Things take a turn for the worse when their sole map suddenly goes missing and things begin to go bump in the night.  One can sense terror beginning to creep into our character's lives insidiously and almost imperceptibly as they try to gather their wits about them.<br/><br/>""It's impossible to get lost in America!"" one of the characters, Amanda, is heard to affirm with a little trepidation as day rapidly approaches night. Little does she know! Go find out what happens next.  I guarantee you won't sleep so easy after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>What I have a problem with is this: The common-sense tactics anyone lost in the woods employs to get un-lost is nowhere to be found in the movie. There's a scene where our doomed travelers decide, after the loss of their only map, to travel south and end up going around in a huge circle.  They made this decision while standing next to a stream!  Everyone, or at least, I hope everyone knows that one way to get un-lost in the woods is to follow a stream which won't turn on itself and usually ends up leading out of the woods. Another is the insane insistence that they have of taking their cameras and shooting film everywhere they went.  ""Normal"" people don't do that but I guess that without this, there'd be no movie and what fun would that be? <wink> <wink>"

The movie itself was a two-step adventure for me.  The horror buildup, of course, but the psychological interplay between the three kids I thought was terrific.  I liked the ending, although I knew something like that was about to happen. Then when I saw the credits and realized the whole thing was fictional,I was shocked and disappointed.  I had been taken for a ride.  It wasn't until a few hours later that I began to appreciate that ride.

","The Blair Witch Project is little more than a get-rich-quick scheme orchestrated by two young filmmakers. The characterization is non-existant; I never believed that these characters existed outside of the context of the film. It seems like a game of, ""how many times can we get the characters to say the ""f"" word?"" The only way this film could have escaped an R-Rating would be if the entire body of the film were exised. <br/><br/>Also, Heather keeps filming even during the fights, when she would have thrown the camera down and started yelling. Filming is such a mental task that it is impossible to do it while ruled by emotions.<br/><br/>But it just isn't scary. To scare people with implied things is great, but it requires more imagination than either of the filmmakes have.<br/><br/>
It reminds me of the story where the king had someone make him new clothes, and when he went into town naked (thinking he had clothes) everyone loved it because they didn't want to be different. Then one person told the truth. With this film, everyone says they love it because they don't want appear out of the norm, and only a few people have spoken the truth"

","I finally saw this film after being psyched to do so ever since I heard about the Sundance screening. I wasn't expecting much... I wanted it to be a fun watch and for it to be scary. It was neither. In particular, the ending felt like a huge cop out and the house location felt like ""the spooky abandoned dwelling in the woods"" with absolutely no sign or sense of a presence. The art direction of the house consisted of children's handprints when so much could have been done to really evoke a scary presence (a lone television in a room, etc.) I endured the boring unraveling of the film crew (a good performance from Heather Donahue notwithstanding) thinking I might at least see a mutilated or possessed Joshua, but it ended elusively with a split-second visual reference to an anecdote muttered toward the beginning of the film. I don't like having to read a FAQ on a fan site to figure out what I'm seeing.

The actors deserve enormous credit for their work -- the directors somewhat less, for seemingly falling in love with the gimmick and not stitching together the raw footage with a better-developed structure.<br/><br/>Some of the extra-filmic Blair Witch background lore needed to make it into the movie proper; the hauntings don't make sense without it.  There are a couple of severe idiot-plot problems: why, oh why, do these three college kids not simply follow the creek, which has to come out someplace, and so escape the woods?  And why do Heather and Mike succumb to Horror Cliche Disease and go straight into the Creepy House From Nowhere, there to split up and ensure their imminent doom?  (They should have followed the inevitable path to the house down the hill into town.)<br/><br/>It's also mildly odd that there's no sexual/physical chemistry between the characters, especially after Josh disappears and Heather and Mike are left to each other.  I am NOT talking about casual nookie or horizontal tango-ing here, but the sort of bonding-under-stress that frequently occurs in crisis situations such as that in the film.<br/><br/>Criticisms notwithstanding, there's a lot to like about the movie (provided you can see it in a properly darkened theater; it *really* needs the blackest possible black to work at its best).

"holly-31","Null","0","0","4 August 1999"," A severe disappointment
","I, too, saw ""The Blair Witch Project"", after much anticipation- having read the many ""rave"" reviews about the ""best horror film in the last twenty years"".  I cannot express the incredulity and anger I felt after the lights came up.  Not only I, but the entire audience groaned, and demanded their money back.  Now, after being a film lover for over twenty years, and taking over three buses to see a Sergei Eisentein film festival, this should tell you that I am not a casual film goer.  I did not expect, nor want to see such drivel as ""Friday the 13th"", or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". What I did expect to see was an intelligent, psychological horror film.  Sure, I knew that this film had an ultra-low budget, and I've seen less expertly filmed movies than this before.  However, the interminable pacing- where was this tiny shred of a story going?  Add to the mix that I abhor the ""great oudoors"", anyway, and still I wan't moved to the slightest bit of fright. Getting lost in the woods, or otherwise, is hardly a cinematic original.  I knew well enough not to expect bang-up ""special effects""- and I've never been a fan of them anyway.  But, the story, such as it was, went nowhere, and there was no payoff.  I didn't expect blood, guts, or gore- a superior film doesn't need them.  What I did expect, was the build-up of suspense, of dread, and the claustrophobic feeling that you can't wake up from a bad dream.  The only thing that I can say in the film's defense, was that the writers had a nice ear for dialogue- not stunningly good, mind you- just nice. But that was it- and it wasn't worth the price of a movie ticket.  I felt gypped, partially because of the ""brilliant"" advertising on the Internet prior to the release of the film. What makes me angriest was that I fell for ""the next big thing"", something that I always avoid.  I don't like to be told, ""see this"" or 'do that""- I like to make up my own mind.  This time, I didn't , and you know, I felt just like a lemming.  Bravo to the filmmakers, who have surely finagled big, fat contracts.  The ""brilliance"" was in the publicity, not the film. As a great lover of film, I was really disappointed.  I'd been rooked.  Welcome to Hollywood."

","Instead of giving a ""this movie is a must see, go see it now"" kind of review, I'm just going to give a brief overview of what seeing this movie was like for me:<br/><br/>The opening scenes and the first few days of their documentary: The filmmakers are typical 20-somethings.  ""My friends and I act a lot like this"", I thought to myself.  Right down to how I videotape everything and annoy my friends by doing so.  The search for Blair Witch landmarks had an ""everyday"" feeling to any camping trip.<br/><br/>The filmmakers get lost: I can't say I've ever been lost in the woods, but I could relate to the frustration of walking in circles trying to find a way out of a place.  The filmmakers' sarcasm and anger with each other seemed natural for the situation.<br/><br/>The night incidents: Every night was worse than the one before, and the point where the filmmakers ran from the tent with Heather trying to understand what was out there was a tense moment.  I felt a very uneasy feeling during the scene because I couldn't see what was out there, but I knew something was.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT FOR THE NEXT PARAGRAPH*<br/><br/>Josh disappears: When Heather and Mike wake up and see that Josh isn't there anymore, I knew that something happened, but what and when and how?  I couldn't tell.  That was the worst part of the situation.  The witch's ""gifts"" about Josh's fate were unnerving.  Mike and Heather were now realizing that they were part of a game now and were being hunted down.<br/><br/>
Heather's close-up: I understood with Heather's apology to the parents of three filmmakers that that she, as well as I, knew that their time was short and the game was almost over.  This is the shot that represents so much of the ""Blair Witch"" images that you see, and is one of the most saddening moments because of its finality.<br/><br/>The final scenes: I refuse to give anything away, but during those last few moments, I felt my heart start really pumping in my chest and chills go through my body.  I was open-mouthed with nervousness and shock until the credits rolled.  A powerful, terrifying ending scene.<br/><br/>At home: After the movie, I went home.  I went outside to look for my dog. I have a small patch of wooded area in my backyard.  In calling my dog, and going into my backyard, my stomach knotted tightly with apprehension.  I almost left ""Sparky"" outside.  It's only a movie, isn't it?<br/><br/>This isn't a standard horror movie by any means.  There isn't a hockey-masked, knived hand lunatic waiting in the shadows, accompanied by scary music to build up to the moment.  This is the boogeyman.  This is the creature under your bed.  This is the campfire story.  This is the thing that goes bump in the night.  The creature is never seen, but imagination makes the creature more terrifying than any special effects person could generate. Forget practically every horror movie you've seen.  If you want to be scared on a pure primal level, see this.  This movie deserves every bit of recognition and credit it gets, and while I'm not looking forward to the countless string of rip-offs that with try to capitalize on its success (It happened to ""Scream""), this is the original, and this is the one to remember.  There's no climatic Hollywood showdown.  The trio finds themselves in something that is way over their heads, and the supernatural leads them to their fate.  Anyone who doesn't see this, is denying themselves an amazing film experience, but the reviews are true.  This is truly a frightening film.... but on a different kind of level."

","""The Blair Witch Project"" is not so much a horror movie, but a film that delves into your mind and hits at those fears that haven't been envoked from you in a very long time. The dark woods will never be the same. That sound off in the distance can not be disregarded as the wind. You can't tell yourself you're just hearing things. And what you see is real, and not a misinterpreted, idle object.<br/><br/>This movie is so amazing. With films like this, the shlock that Kevin Williamson pumps out should be banned. Williamson's ""grip on teens"" doesn't do jack for the audiences watching The Blair Witch Project. The characters--which are simply some of the best and most able to be cared for--aren't 20 somethings with great vocabulary and total perfection. No, they're REAL. They are just like you and me. They're like friends you know at school. Or, they are you. And you are them. In the woods. Lost. Hearing those sounds in the far distance, and coming across those sights that will be burned into your mind forever.<br/><br/>I hate ""trendy horror."" Movies like Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and The Faculty--along with many others--are some of the lowest forms of horror around. And so many other films with such potential follow them. The Mummy, for example, tried to be funny, taking after some of these films. The Mummy was a horrible movie. All these movies are so bad, but so many people like them. I can't see why. Now we've got another sickening teen-horror-comedy coming out called ""Teaching Miss Tingle."" First of all, it is a rip off of the amazingly gripping novel ""Killing Mr. Griffin,"" by Lois Duncan. Second of all, it's predictable already. You know what's going to happen. And you know what the characters are going to be like. You will never connect with them. And the movie will be terrible.<br/><br/>My point is that The Blair Witch Project is real. All of it is reality, in a fiction movie. The characters are real, the story is real, and the fear is real. Though the whole movie is fiction, you can't say that, or, ""It's only a movie"" with this one. It's like reality, on film. And by the time Heather and Mike get to that old house--which is one of the most horrific scenes ever in horror history--you will feel their fear, and you will wish that you could save them. This is definitely the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was a lot like The Blair Witch Project. It scared you because you felt the realism in it. And like these movies, the next true horror movie will come many years later.<br/><br/>I completely and totally recommend The Blair Witch Project. But don't watch it for the expected scares, but for it's psychological terror. And if you're going to see Blair Witch, PLEASE rent Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is just as good, if not better."

","""The Blair Witch Project"" uses its shoestring budget to great advantage: without relying on expensive special effects, it forces the audience to use its imagination in confronting, along with the three filmmakers, the terrors of the unknown.  Hollywood today feels compelled to SHOW everything onscreen, to go for the cheap & easy shock.  This film relies on a well-honed script, very convincing acting (the actors seem ""real""), and taut direction that causes the audience to genuinely feel for, and empathize with, the woebegone filmmakers.  We've all been afraid of the dark, and this film builds its suspense on this premise.  The only downside for me about the film is that it could have left the mystery more ambiguous; i.e., I thought it emphasized too much that the mystery was genuinely supernatural, rather than manufactured (a prank by outsiders that got out of hand).  Other than that, I thought it was quite a good film.  Bravo!"

You are a retard.<br/><br/>An instant classic no matter what.  Relies on the unknown and your own imagination to scare you.  The fact that people were not scared,  or dissapointed that whatever was chasing them was not revealed, is a sad reminder that some people need to be force fed and told what is scary,  rather then allowing the TRUE magic of this EXPERIENCE take their nerves for a ride.<br/><br/>Home video style.  Enough shaky camera work to make some motion sick.  Most will complain that this makes the film crap....but again,  it is another sickening fact that people need their whoppers ""made their way"".  The low production skill in some of the more intense scenes (No to poor visuals,  shaky camera from the actors own fear,  to the cameras being used as their own light source!) only adds to the realism.  If the camera was perfectly still, if production technique was smooth and steady while SOMETHING chased the crew down,  it would NOT work.  Nuff said on that.<br/><br/>Other things people may complain about,  people arguing,  long middle chunks,  all add to the realism.  Again,  people not opening their minds to the main point of the film.  It is shooting for realism,  not commercials.  The fact that the film is shown in the right proportions instead of blown up to fit the screen shows how much detail was put into making this thing as realistic as possible,<br/><br/>Where it flaws:  Does not go into enough detail into the myth.  It's hard to say whether actually watching the extra clips on the web site enhance the experience, or ruin it for some. It added for me.  Those who have enough of a brain to pay moderate attention will know how to put together the connections to what the towns people tell the crew...and what they find in the woods later.....but the site adds it and makes it stick.  Possibly the main reason some were dissapointed at the end.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  IMO,  best horror film I have seen come out of the 90's.  It IS of the same level as The Exorcist,  Texas Chainsaw Massacre,  and The Shining over all. Final scene alone has stuck in my head longer,  or as long as any of the scenes from these three,  and I dont see it stop haunting me anytime soon.  Oscar?

After a week of having to run out of the room every time my friends wanted to talk about TBP, I decided it was time to see it for myself.<br/><br/>Amazing.  Truely amazing.  This was not a fear that came from the same place as ""Nightmare on Elm St,"" or ""Psycho,"" this was a fear of identification and knowing that these people are real.  Okay, they were actors, but if you didn't know it was (I assume very loosly) scritped, and didn't know this was fiction, there are very few give-aways that would tip you off.  Possibly on future viewing there will be more evident gaffs that point to the fact that this was all a work of imagination. But after my first look at it, the film seems to be solid.<br/><br/>Aside from creeping me out, I left the film wanting to watch a documentary on the filming of this movie!  I can't imagine the process and improvisions these actors must have gone through to attain the level of ""reality"" that was displayed in the film. The film itself was full of strong choices.  Some worked for me, some didn't.  But either way, they were bold,defined and when viewed as a whole made for some intense viewing.<br/><br/>Some people have complained that ""nothing was explained."" (particularly referring to the end) In a day and age when Hollywood panders to the lowest common denominator by holding the audience's hand and then proceeding to hit them over the head with key plot points and cliches this movie took a more absurdist route and left some of the exposition up in the air. But I think that was part of the fear factor.  When given the loose ends of these particular circumstances, our own imagination is what scares us even more when it comes to the possibilities of ""what happened.""<br/><br/>All in all, see this film.  Become engrossed in it.  Don't worry about ""This is supposed to be the scariest movie ever,""  just sit back and take it as it comes and let your imagination fill in the rest. Sometimes the scariest part of the movie is in our own minds."

These negative ""know nothing about films"" disgruntled movie-goers keep saying things like, ""Well, i didn't understand the end"".  WELL... if they had paid attention from the beginning, then they would totally understand the end.  (As with most movies).  I mean, if you start telling me a story, and i ignore the beginning, but then listen to the end and am confused, would it be fair for me to complain to you that i do not understand?  No, it would be my fault for not paying attention, as it is THESE PEOPLE'S faults for being so inattentive to the plot. <br/><br/>I have also heard complaints of a ""shaky camera"" problem.  Well, DUH. They're cold, they're scared... and, gee, I guess they left the Steady Cam at home, eh?  If all of the footage was perfect and straight, then i wouldn't believe the movie.  Oh, and another complaint that is unfounded is that it's ""three whiny crying annoying kids... fighting about where to go... totally don't know what they're doing...""  No freakin crap!!  They're college students, not Paul Bunyun.  Excuse them if they don't really know how to survive in the woods!  By the way... if you were wandering for days and couldn't make it back to your car, and every night you're terrified, i think you would be a little on the edge as well.  people fight in scary situations, it's human nature. Oh, and one more thing... STOP COMPLAINING THAT THE ENDING IS CONFUSING! OF COURSE IT IS CONFUSING!!  I can't believe that these people are actually, basically complaining that no one was filming after everyone's dead.  i mean, was the WITCH supposed to pick up the camera and finish the movie??

I want to discuss what people are beating it up for.<br/><br/>--The Final Shot<br/><br/>The last shot in the movie is the scariest image I have ever scene (next to Paula Jones holding that Check. Eek!). I read a comment in this list describing the last shot as: ""dead guy in corner."" Mike, back to camera in near darkness, is not dead for this last shot. As the legend has it, The Blair Witch, when presented with multiple victims, killed one and made the others stand in the corner because she didn't like feeling their eyes on her. Mike wasn't dead. He was under her control... or something... I don't know exactly ... waiting to be killed next. <br/><br/>--""It sucked! You never even see her!""<br/><br/>Or so a friend of mine said after the movie. Now, this is the scariest part of the film: You don't see her. You see very little. Hints of her existence: stick men, handprints (Egads!), etc. The closest we come is in the end when we hear Heather get hit... or something (again, we don't know for sure) ... and the camera falls to the ground and the credits roll.<br/><br/>The film is basically a POV experience. We ARE Heather for that part. We are looking through her eyes. We are just as scared because...she didn't ever see the witch either! We see Mike...what's going on? ...There's something behind! -click- That's it. So what happened? You should think about it tonight in bed... in the dark.<br/><br/>--""They wouldn't have kept the cameras running.""<br/><br/>This is simple. We see early on that Heather is obsessive about her film. She wants to document it all. She even writes so in her journal (which can be read at www.blairwitch.com). She partially was leaving the tapes behind as clues in case they didn't make it back. ('If we die out here, at least the cops will see what happened when they find our bones.')<br/><br/>--Vulgarity<br/><br/>If YOU were in their situation, YOU would be cursing and screaming like a banshee, too. <br/><br/>--Jerky camera movements<br/><br/>Well, throwing up certainly adds to the realism of the experience, doesn't it? <br/><br/>In conclusion, I have to say the The Blair Witch Project is the scariest movie I've ever seen. I still, four days after seeing it, sleep with the lights on. Maybe I just have a hyperactive imagination...? Whatever, I'm just frightened."

","One of the best things about The Blair Witch Project is the fact that you have to use your imagination.  You are out in the middle of nowhere, and there are noises moving all around you in the dark.  You can't see anything, you only hear things.  And that's what scares you the most.  If it's something you can see, you'll think of a way to deal with it.  If you don't see it, you don't know what to do.  So you become scared.  Fear starts to overwhelm you and clouds your thinking.  That's what this movie does.  You have to use your imagination and put yourself in these kids shoes.  There aren't any monsters to blow up, no ghosts to run away from, no houses to escape from.  Everything around you has turned into something frightening. The Blair Witch Project is a movie that relies on the gradual building of suspense rather than the usual horror movie tricks.  If you scoff, try going camping in an unfamiliar place and see if you can figure out what's going bump in the night."

","This is truly one of the great horror films, not just because it's scary but because of the way the film comments on what makes its characters open to fear and destruction.  It's one of the most cogent comments on its generation that I've ever seen, and the greatest compliment I can pay the film makers is that after getting us to laugh at the characters, particularly their self-absorption and lack of grounding in the real world, it still made me feel sorry for them. But be warned:  now that the film has gone wide, I'd recommend not going to your typical mall theatre.  The screening I attended was filled with people who had no idea what to expect. Aside from the usual annoyances-late arrivals, cell phones and almost constant talking-the audience was audibly antagonistic to the film.  I think they wanted severed heads and loving closeups of mutilated bodies, which is definitely not what this movie is about.

","I have never seen a cinema manager barracked by the audience before. Sadly the night I watched this drivel the audience did queue up for their money back. The amazing thing...some of them actually got half price vouchers for another film. I'm afraid this is not a case of an audience missing the point of a classic horror movie but rather quite the opposite. As I waited, heart pounding, hot dog and popcorn at the ready for the movie to start, all the talk around me was the same ""At last were gonna get a good old fashioned chiller instead of those ridiculous slasher movies"". My personal all time favourite movie of this genre was ""The Changeling"" an early 1980's film with George C Scott. I wondered could Blair Witch do the same as that film did?. I didn't want bloody scenes of some ice hockey masked looney slashing up every heavy cleavaged long legged bimbo in town and thankfully i didn't get that. What I did want was strange noises and happenings. I wanted to spend this film with the hair on the back of my neck standing to attention while I scanned the background of the shot to see if something was lurking there. Nope didnt get that either. I watched for 90 minutes waiting for a single moment that would cause my body to tense up. I watched these three characters stumble through the woods arguing. The last thirty second promised something close to a chilling moment but by then I was too numb with boredom to properly react. My advice. If you love a good old fashioned chill as opposed to blood and gore slasher movies, Blair witch is not the film. True it is an alternative to the slashers and i applaud the directors for their attempts but I suggest that you leave this out of your halloween video list. Rent out ""The Changeling [George C Scott], What lies beneath [Harrison Ford & Michelle Pfieffer] and Ghost Story [Fred Astair, Douglas fairbanks jnr...it was made in the 80's so dont let the actors put you off] These three are truly chilling movies."

","Blair Witch is most effective if you disregard the Hollywood nature of its hype and go in with an open mind. This is not a Hollywood horror film; it is not frightening or tense (or dependent on lovable characters/clever dialogue/smart cinematography) in the traditional way; it's an atmosphere rather than a story.<br/><br/>It reminded me of Tom Stoppard's play 'Rosencranz and Guildenstern are dead,' in that it concentrates on the small, bewildered people who usually form a backdrop to the principal action of a narrative. They're the ones who wander off and vanish mysteriously so that the hero can say, ""My God, there's something nasty out there,"" and go on to deal with it. 'Witch's' characters never come close to dealing with the Thing in the woods. They never even try. They're uncharismatically human.<br/><br/>Yes, the faux-documentary technique has been used in indy films before. Yes, 'Witch' is repetitious and sometimes frustrating. Yes, the last half- to three-quarters of an hour of the film needs a few more ideas, and yes, the editing should have been tighter. In fact, I spent most of the movie thinking, ""I'd chop that, I'd make that shorter; I'd hack whole minutes off the end of Heather's scene with the bundle of sticks; nice cut; hey, that's a good moment, was it scripted or spontaneous, I wonder?"" - and somehow, none of that detracted from the overall feel of the thing.

","Too many people have complained that this film isn't scary, thats is boring, that that characters are stupid, etc, without putting proper thought into it.

At first I was quite disappointed, but once I discussed it with my friends and began to work things out and piece things together, I realised that most of the time the trio are lost in the woods is very suspenseful and leads up to a spooky finale with a very haunting closing image.<br/><br/>So, my point is, don't go and see this film if you're not prepared to have a good, long think about it.

"coddy","Null","0","0","16 December 1999"," Look, I *get* it, I just don't *like* it.
","So much has been said about the minimalism of this film, about the way it builds up suspense and fear by selectively restricting what you see, that it comes as quite a disappointment that the elements which inspire total hysteria in this tormented trio are so earth-bound and tangible. There is simply no sense of mysticism.  <br/><br/>The most clever aspect of this movie is that virtually all continuity and dramatic weaknesses can be explained away by the basic concept that we are only seeing what the three students had filmed. Any blanks that we feel exist we have to fill in for ourselves (does this make it interactive?). If you had to argue the case for the legitimacy of the structure of this film you could easily do it - but you don't have to, you have to sit through it - and that's not quite so easy.<br/><br/>The exposition is obvious and cliched. The mock-umentary has been done oh-so-many times before. The middle section is alternately grating and tedious. Due to the absence of hours and hours of footage, supposedly when the trio weren't actually filming their misadventures, there are a number of strange dramatic anomalies when characters seem to develop particular attitudes completely out-of-the-blue. It may be true to the film-makers concept of ""found footage"" but it sure doesn't make for interesting or appealing (or even understandable) characters. There are a couple of effective sequences - Josh's confrontational ""this is your motivation"" routine and Heather's ""I'm so sorry"" scene are both quite strong - but they only serve to show up how weak the bulk of the dialogue really is. The ending I thought was far too literal, although I would like someone to explain to me just who was holding the 16mm camera in the final sequence.<br/><br/>When you pare the story down (it's already wafer-thin) it reveals a basic premise that is only a very slight variation on the traditional slasher flick. They're lost in the woods, they're scared, they're being hunted, they're screaming, they're turning on each other, they're screaming, they're hungry, they're being hunted, they're screaming... etc etc. I'm not going to reveal anything that could be considered a 'spoiler' but you really aren't going to get anything from this movie that you haven't seen (many times) before. It just appears to be different for stylistic reasons.<br/><br/>You may be tempted to argue the case of the presentation of this film, that it is innovative and inspired. Sure, it may be unusual to see this particular style on the big screen at your local megaplex, but it's nothing that you couldn't have experienced at your local art college or film school at virtually anytime since the late sixties. I'm serious. I mean good on 'em and everything - they've challenged the big boys and their big budgets and they've won handsomely (if it means that we may not have to sit through Godzilla 2 or 3 it can only be a good thing)  - but get a grip and look at the film itself in isolation. It's simply not the event it has become.<br/><br/>
Also, if the film-makers where *absolutely* true to their initial concept, shouldn't we have seen the footage in two separate sections - the video footage and the 16mm footage. The fact that it has been spliced and edited together by someone dampens its alleged authenticity (for me, at any rate)."

","Good things:<br/><br/>1. This film has set a new standard. If this kind of film can be done with just $60K (even though people complain... if you knew how the film was made you'd agree this money wasn't wasted), then think of how much better than Blairwitch a film like StarWars should be (which cost hundreds of millions). Blairwitch had a better concept, better acting, tighter production and better promotion/marketing than every other Hollywood movie this year.<br/><br/>2. People will see the merit of this kind of film and we'll see talented but underfunded film people coming out from their shells and embracing us all with their art.<br/><br/>Bad things:<br/><br/>1. A new generation of fearless film critic has been born. It's cool to think Blairwitch wasn't scary... it's cool to say that low budget = low quality. 2. Big film production companies will pick up and cash in on the originality of films like Blairwitch, Cube and Pi and totally prostitute the film industry... once again. Blairwitch clones are a certainty. Anything that made this much money will most certainly be investigated by stiffs in suits.<br/><br/>

You believed that you were watching three students lost in the woods, experiencing genuine fear and anger.  Anyone who has ever camped in a forest will relate to strange noises in the night, and how scary they can be. <br/><br/>It isn't for the unimaginative, who has seen every scary gory horror flick, and wants to have everything laid out for them.  Your own imagination is what makes this film so frightening.  Aside from personal opinions on how scary it is, the concept is excellent.  Very original and simple.  One of the lowest budgeted films to come out this year, but very entertaining, proving that you don't need mega-bucks to tell a good story, or give people a few moments of terror.<br/><br/>I was freaked out by it more than I realised.

To say that I merely hated this film would not be anywhere near enough to express my anger, shock and disbelief of how so many critics could be duped into thinking this film had any merit at all, let alone one of the scariest films of all time (as Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gushed in one of his many, wide of the mark reviews. This guy probably thinks Denise Richards is the future of cinema.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I have not personally encountered one human being who actually liked this movie. Where are they? I see comments written favorably on here, but I wouldn't put it past Artisan to have made them up. In reality, I don't think anyone really DID like this movie. It's one big hoax, just like the movie itself. I hope all the reviewers that were paid off are having a Merry Christmas with their extra cash. As for the rest of us, here are some telltale signs for the New Millennium of what a ""groundbreaking"" film need include:<br/><br/><ul><li>The absence of any talented actors, especially in the way of improvisation. Can't think of a line? No problem. Scream a string of curse words and get your voice to such a high pitch that hunting dogs and St. Bernards everywhere will be able to track you from 50 miles away.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Give your characters not a smidgen of intelligence. Have them go out into the woods completely unprepared, with not enough survival supplies, but enough film and Hi-8 tapes and batteries to last for 4 days. Also, have them lose a map and bicker about it for the rest of the trip without once stopping to realize, ""Hey, we filmed the map at the beginning of the trip in close up. (Along with practically every other step we took) Why don't we rewind the tape and see if we can figure out where we are by looking at it through the viewfinder."" Naaaah, that would maybe makes sense, plus it would waste precious battery power.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Put the audience to sleep and try to convince them that while they were snoring, they missed all the scary parts. This can be the only explanation. I saw it twice (once in the theater, once on video under threat of death) and went through every frame of that movie looking for something scary. Damn, biting off a hangnail is more frightening. Then try to suggest to the audience that it isn't what you see, it's what you DON'T see, that's scary. In other words, maybe I should have saved my 9 bucks and imagined a scarier movie than what I saw? Well, sorry, that's why I go to the movies, so I don't have to actually invent one, myself. And if you want to suggest what's out there through the soundtrack, maybe you want to turn it up so people can actually hear what's going on. To me, it sounded like someone breaking celery stalks into a microphone and a bunch of drunk frat boys going ""oooohh. Booooo."" (Or maybe that was the audience.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lastly, tell anyone who dare denounce the film that it is they themselves who have no vision or imagination.</li></ul>"
"Minster-2","8","0","0","7 December 1999"," A new genre is born
","The Blair Witch Project lays foundation for a fully new genre - reality horror. The film manages most of all by its realistic camera, but also by its script and cutting, to establish an unmatched horror scenario, which no Hollywood movie with well lit scenery and all too stylish actors can ever achieve. Suspense first is subtly, later drastically raised - the audience finds themselves amused, baffled, frightened, with a shift to the latter one with the ongoing plot. The final shots at the film's peak dig themselves into your mind - probably they won't let you sleep well the next night.<br/><br/>But the movie is more than that. The psychological development of the three actors, their way of reacting to the increasing threat, is well observed and very realistic. The same goes for the group dynamic between the three, which adds to the plot as an important dramatic element. Finally, the end leaves a lot open to discussion (which some people don't like - to my mind this helps you reflect on the movie and might give you a deeper insight into what actually happened in the film and what this might mean to you personally).<br/><br/>You should see this film if you are into horror movies, or if you like good and innovative movies in general.

","* * ½ (2½ out of 5)<br/><br/>
The Blair Witch Project<br/><br/>Directed By : Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez (II), 1999<br/><br/>Hype backlash bigtime<br/><br/>
Tremendously over-hyped horror hit (grossed over $130 million in US) that collapses under it's own weight regardless.<br/><br/>Three kids, two cameras (a handheld and a 16mm) and an investigation into the cold, rainy woods of Washington searching for witches and superstition make out The Blair Witch Project. The `documentary' is presented throughout as a true story and was even preceded by much internet and word-of-mouth hype as to whether or not it was a true story. Of course it is only a movie.<br/><br/>
Very repetitive (day, night, day, night) and be advised to leave most of your logic at home (No mobile phone? One compass only? One map only? No clue as to sun-reading at all?). Thank you.<br/><br/>However; the premise was intriguing. The back-to-basics approach of filmmaking, the superb acting (mostly ad-libbed) and the desolate scenery make for an interesting experience. The intimacy and anxiety is enhanced by the great performances of Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. <br/><br/>It would have been interesting to observe (or be) one of the few who viewed this just when it was taking off, because frankly I wasn't convinced at all.<br/><br/>
Nevertheless, viewing Blair Witch in a packed cinema a few days after opening night, where 90% of the crowd consisted of teenagers, I made an interesting observation. The last horror film that most of these kids saw was probably in the vein of  'I Know What Jason and Freddie Did Last Spring'. <br/><br/>So naturally, they wanted gore! <br/><br/>Or did they? Some made remarks during the movie ('Is this it?' 'When does it start?' 'Alright with all that name calling!').? Maybe they had just heard that this was the movie that had fooled everyone across the sea and that it was genuinely scary and tested new ground. <br/><br/>If that is the approach, then be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Sure, I was annoyed at these spoiled and  'illiterate' (pun intended) MTV-generation youths, that had apparently been feeding on junk-and-dollar horror for too long. <br/><br/>At the same time  however - their reaction is somewhat understandable. The hoax was part of the package. Kind of like de-masking Jason.  State of the art special effects may show him to be ugly as nothing you've ever seen, but he looked so much more frightening with his hockey mask on. He was MUCH more terrifying when shrouded in mystery. <br/><br/>This is the trick and trap that Blair Witch reminds us of, and ultimately falls for itself. Kapow. <br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a small movie celebrating it's own originality and thereby to an extent forgetting the initial task. Which is to scare! Yet it is somewhat charming and most importantly solid proof of how spoiled and unimaginative many have become when watching horror.<br/><br/>
Note : The last ten minutes should keep you on needles though. And the ending is brilliant."
"david.harrington","Null","0","0","4 December 1999"," Very disappointing
","I was expecting a lot more from this film, after all the hype that was generated surrounding it. To be honest, the result of the film is frankly laughable (in fact, if it was reclassified as a comedy, I would feel more inclined to give it a good review).<br/><br/>Several people in their reviews have applauded its realism and originality. I don't believe this for a moment:<br/><br/>Realism: There are such huge holes in the plot as to make it frankly unbelievable - why did they not find their way out with a GPS receiver, rather than spend days wandering around in the middle of nowhere. The notion that there was some mysterious force sending them back to where they began is completely unbelievable as there was no cohesive storyline which would have led to that conclusion.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the female character actually carries the camera around and continues filming, all the time - even up to the end. I'm pretty sure that if I were in their situation, I'd leg it pretty sharpish - the instinct for survival just wasn't apparent at all.<br/><br/>Then there is the alleged originality - well, this type of camcorder documentary has been done before, and with more success, so I don't know why people would say that.<br/><br/>Next there are the characters - they were, especially the female, so obnoxious and horrible (the bad language they used almost constantly was hardly realistic due to the way it was almost thrown in just to provide some sort of fake emotion - all it did was annoy me) that if they'd called for help, I would have left them there! What were the film makers thinking when they came up with the idea of coming up with characters with whom you could make almost no emotional connection at all?<br/><br/>As for the film being frightening, I don't agree with that either. The makers of this film could do worse than take a lesson from directors like John Carpenter and Stephen King, who know how to build tension - you certainly don't do it by adding a few scary noises and blurring the picture a bit! And as for the piles of twigs, well, so what? How do we know it was not just all a practical joke? While the complete lack of gore was not in itself a bad thing, there was nothing else to replace it - no tension building at all. Compare this with a classic like Halloween which also has minimal gore, and was also made on a shoestring budget.<br/><br/>One other little niggle - why show shots from the 16mm camera in black and white while the Hi-8 camera was in colour? Do they really think that people were too stupid to be able to tell the difference?<br/><br/>Finally, for those who say that you need a little bit of imagination to enjoy it, perhaps that is true, but I think you need more than a little imagination - you need to completely suspend all belief in reality whatsoever!"

","*** I'm sad to say The Blair Witch Project did not scare me at all.  And I really wanted to be scared too.  Part of the problem for me was that I couldn't get past a couple of very basic errors in the film.  If I did, I too could have been dragged into their world and had the bejeezus scared out of me like so many others.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very unique and effective film.  There is strong work by the actors, with only occasional groan-inducing over-acting.  And the pacing, setting, and art direction were more than adequate.  I just had some major problems getting ""into"" the film because of a couple of huge logic problems I'll describe below (may be considered very slight spoilers).<br/><br/>For one, it just seemed impossible to get that lost in the woods (in MD anyway).  To walk for days and days without seeing train tracks or an old road or a fence (of a farm or something).  It is hinted that supernatural forces are keeping them in the woods.  They even had a couple of ""How to survive in the woods"" books.  Surely they would say to follow one those streams, or climb a tree on the top of the hill.  Not much of a film if they got un-lost maybe, but technically they walked about 40 hours and found nothing??!!  maybe in Alaska or Wyoming, but certainly not 60 miles outside DC.  I think a bit more creativity on the writing staff was warranted.  A slight injury to one of the party, or cut the adventure back a day or two. I've been lost in the woods - you walk till you hit the water then you follow the shore.  you don't criss cross it a billion times like an idiot.<br/><br/>Also, the constant filming.  They made attempts to explain why ( ""It's all I have left."" - apparently her will to film was stronger than her will to survive - quite a feat indeed).  They filmed even when running for their lives.  Again, without the constant filming you get no story, but maybe there was another way out.  <br/><br/>So there you have it: I'm one of those people who has a bit more trouble suspending disbelief than others.  So if you can suspend your disbelief, say goodbye to bejeezus, because it's going to be scared out of ya.  But if you're like me, it'll be an interesting and unique film, not without merit, but without scares."

He could have put the weird things on the trees(don't ask me how!), and when Heather and Joshua were killed(or were they...) Michael could have done it!!!!

","I had waited ages to see this film, there had been so much hype after its release in the U.S that I thought it must be really good. What a disappointment. I had read the dossier and seen the documentary Curse of the Blair Witch and had heard people rave about it for months. So my expectations were high- but what an absolute bore. This film is not scary ( for the most part) unless you believe that its true. There is little tension in the first 45 minutes, with the only real terror occurring in the last five minutes- something I could probably have done without. It certainly is eerie, and it certainly kept me awake at night- but I was expecting something more. The woods have unfortunately been a lot scarier in other films ( try Twin Peaks)which was part of its downfall. The film is really original, and the camera work was done very well (documentary style) but it still didn't hold my attention. I found the characters really irritating, especially Heather who evidently had no sense of self preservation. It plays a lot like a student film- I suppose its meant to but I just found it quite boring for the most part and really nothing more than a clever marketing ploy- for which the film makers should be congratulated. However, as a film standing on its own it just does not make the grade. Very Disappointing"

They were gone for a long time, but here they are, and the actors do a perfect job. The whole movie is shot from a hand-held camera view in either color or black & white, and yep, that's shaky. But it makes this movie so much more believable! <br/><br/>The story: 3 student film makers go out into the woods to find ancient burial grounds. But there is a legend in town. A terrifying legend. The further they go, the more they get lost. The three start to get nervous and scared, because strange things happen at night and at day. Then, one of them disappears.<br/><br/>You don't see any gore, thank god. The movie gets inside your head, makes you think about what's happening out there, what could possibly caused all those strange things. And this, combined with perfect acting, a great setting, the beautiful camerawork and a great story, makes for a true horror movie. I was scared, not by sudden YOUCH-thrills or gore, but by pure terror. And that is what real horror is all about.<br/><br/>You owe it to yourself to see this movie if you like absolute horror."

Not even the finale rescues it. Sure, the potential for tension and fear are there, but the best ingredients are not played up enough, not allowed to development.

","Finally got around to watching TBWP (on video, with the lights off), and I'm still sorting out my feelings on it. On a pure gut level, I found the film very effective, in a way I'm sure the filmmakers intended.  The improvised, ""home movie"" nature of the film generates an authentic ""feel"" to the proceedings, despite lapses in logic (like why Heather would continue shooting when in a life-or-death situation). A couple images stayed with me long after the film ended, like the unbundling of the twigs, and Mike standing in the corner of the house at the end. I also like the fact that the characters, particularly Heather, start out very cocky and self-assured and become emotional and vulnerable by the film's end.<br/><br/>But I was also left wanting so much more. There simply was not enough ""background"" on the legend before the scary stuff started happening. Adding another ten or fifteen minutes of ""setup"" in the town would have helped tremendously.  Even when they're in the woods, a scene or two of Heather reading from the witch cult book would have helped flesh out the situation. Other viewers have suggested a ""framing"" device of a mock television special to help establish the situation more, and I think that would have been a good idea. Despite the intensity of some of the later scenes, I was never able to fully appreciate their predicament because I never fully understood the threat.<br/><br/>So in the end the film feels half-baked . . . great technique, but rushed, as if the details hadn't been fully thought out by the time of the shooting.

Put it like that and the Blair Witch Project simplicity is revealed.  Not that I'm saying this is bad - simple can be good, and to be fair, as most lines were improvised, a simple plot can be turned into a fairly realistic film.  Note: fairly realistic.  No documentary team, no matter HOW amateur, would take footage as shakey as some of the Blair Witch shots.  OK, it's on a camcorder, but even so.  The word 'overplayed' springs to mind. The same rings true with the dialogue - the arguments seem drawn out, the emotion just somehow inappropriate, and the locations are simply dull. It has its good points though: the few scary bits ARE scary, and the implied witchcraft is intriguing spooky, but as a whole the movie just seems too bland for my liking.

It's also very refreshing that they managed to make a very old fashioned ""horror"" movie, purely based on suggestion, with no expensive digital special effects at all. Hollywood, eat your heart out! Finally: there's a much better Belgian ""mocumentary"" about a serial killer titled "" C'est Arrive Pres De Chez Vous/ Man Bites Dog"". Go check that one out. I'm pretty sure the makers of the Blair witch Project were inspired by it!"

","Do you believe there's such a thing as positive fate, a force generous enough to place you at a crossroads of time and place offering rewards far beyond anything your actual actions might have earned? If you don't, then maybe the directors of 'Blair Witch Project' really are geniuses, geniuses at hustling the public mood anyway.<br/><br/>One goes into 'B/W/P' with not only the official publicity but the comments of many for whose views one has respect encouraging one to expect the scariest round-the-campfire story of all time. Instead... well, there's a joke in the film's early stages about someone farting in a tent. As the terrors of the night go, this film is strictly on the level of the latter horror.<br/><br/>And in fact it's the tactic which at first hearing does sound like a stroke of genius - presenting the story like the raw footage of an unfinished documentary - that proves the biggest liability. Initially, it works well in disguising the fact that the 'plot' is the most perfunctory assemblage of horror cliches (we even get the old ""you kids never learn"" line off of one of the local rednecks: is that copyright 'Friday the 13th.' or 'Scooby Doo'?), but before long it becomes clear that the narrow strictures of this format mean the horror can't extend beyond shaky shots of the characters running backward and forward in reaction to the lamest little bits of trick-or-treat: baby cries, twig figures outside the tent, those two nuisance directors shaking the tent. The dramatic and narrative development one grows impatient for would jar with the open-ended confusion of the mockumentary format. (And it's impossible to believe that Heather - who's shooting most of this footage - could be a directing student: wouldn't she, at least in the earlier stages, have some instinct for, some pride in, producing a coherent image? The most fun post-film game might be to imagine the visual mess a Heather who survived these adventures would make of your favourite movie, be it 'Jurassic Park' or 'Brief Encounter'.)<br/><br/>If a little tension does develop in the last five minutes, it's largely because one thinks: ""this is the 'scariest movie ever'. Something scary's got to happen now, surely."" One greets that ruined house like a shipwreck survivor sighting land. The supposedly awesome final image feels like a very short-breathed 'Boo!' at the end of a very long shaggy dog story. Its power for others is only of sociological interest in terms of what it says about the deepest fears of the twenty-something target audience.  Even the congratulations the film has received for an unironic revival of the supernatural horror flick is dubious: the film lacks faith in the witch idea and comes up with a second monster more tied in to the secular dreads of modern tabloid culture (Yup: it's child molesting again: the red under the bed, the Nazi fifth columnist, of the 90's.) Interestingly, this may well be the least political American horror film of the last fifty years: the fact that witches haunt the actual political past of America is never alluded to.<br/><br/>And even for those who have found the movie scary, it's hard to believe it could have the extended life of a true horror classic. Effective or not, the horror is so basic that there simply aren't the deeper layers for subsequent viewings to uncover of, say, 'Psycho' or 'The Innocents' or 'The Shining.' This picture, complete with its airhead protagonists and their ""this is definitely not cool, man,""-type dialogue is closer to 'Friday the 13th. Part 12"": only without the same dramatic complexity.<br/><br/>So why the success? The most positive spin might be that this is one more triumph for postmodern democracy. The audience knows this isn't the work of some snooty-nosed genius: a Hitchcock, a Polanski, a Poe; no, many must be thinking ""Gee, if only i'd gone out into the woods with my videocam last Hallowe'en, I could have been the hottest thing in Hollywood, too!"" But please, guys, don't take that as a suggestion for next Hallowe'en: unless you are another Poe."

Maybe if I hadn't known it was a movie and had thought it was real, I might have gotten into it alittle more, but even then, it would still have bored me to tears.  All that happens is three people get lost in the woods, cry alot, say the F word after every single word and a few other four letter words just to add dialogue.  They find some laughable scarecrow stick figures in the woods, big deal.  One of them wanders off, big deal.  The remaining two cry some more and whine alot.  They find a pile of sticks with a weird bloody thing in it, a little strange, but not really scary.  They find a falling apart house, think they hear the missing guy calling to them.  They run all around the house with the camera, screaming alot.  Finally go in the basement and......nothing.  End of film.  Boring, boring, boring!  I can't even imagine a more boring film.  If you want to see three people yell at each other, whine and cry alot for over an hour, this is your film. Otherwise, don't even bother to pick this one up.  It's an overhyped piece of junk.  The only good thing about the film is the concept itself.  The idea of making a documentary (mockumentary) about the Blair Witch and that the film crew disappears was very good.

","It seems that Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have succeeded in making a great majority of the population portray themselves as mindless nitwits. Maybe I should be blaming Artisan. Either way their both the masterminds of one of the greatest heists in American history (maybe the world, but I'm not familiar with how the movie has done elsewhere); a heist of trust; a heist of intelligence; a heist of common sense. I admit that when I saw the trailer for The Blair Witch Project, I was interested. There has been a lack of genuine scary movies, and I didn't want another shock-horror Hollywood job. Sooner than I realize, the movie is taking the country by storm. I saw numerous positive reviews and the movie was making a killing. In my faulty judgment, I assumed that so many people couldn't be that wrong. That's where I faulted.<br/><br/>My interest began high, but throughout the course of the film, it dropped to next to nothing. The camera work gave me a headache, as I've found it did to other people. A good film is supposed to draw you in with good cinematography, as well as all the other elements of quality film making. The directors tried too hard to get the element of realism with an 8mm camera. It was nauseating.<br/><br/>I sat through the camera work trying to focus on the story. Three film students filming a documentary and getting lost in the woods. Not the best storyline but has potential if done right. It wasn't done right in this film. Every time they turned on that camera, it was one person blaming another for getting them lost. Very dreary and uniteresting. The dialog was supposed to be ""real"" but I just found it tiresome.<br/><br/>The worst part of the film is how the plot unfolded. It kind of cracked open at the first and then hit you across the jaw at the end. No in between. During the course of the film it wasnt' as if (like in normal plotline) you got bits and pieces, then more as the movie went on, so you could try and put it together yourself, or at least make some sense of where things are progressing. The film was extremely confusing in that aspect. The directors don't lead you to the end. Even in surprise ending films you have an idea of what's happening, and there's just a twist at the end. It would have been much better if the directors had lead the audience more besides just throwing out a bunch of film with an ending that you're supposed to like and understand. By the laughs, comments, and profanities that were uttered by some fellow movie goers at the end of the viewing I attended, I at least didn't feel as much alone in not liking this horrible attempt at film."

The 80 minutes that most people find boring actually turn out to be the most important part of the film. It's a dynamic turn in the characters...from getting ready for a campy weekend in the mountains to the sinister realization that one of the members helped sabotage the outing.<br/><br/>I work at a video store. I watch movies for fun. And the last part of this film has to be one of the most perplexing and unsettling 10 minutes of filming I've ever seen. As the characters went into the house, I tried to remind myself of the aforementioned facts. I knew what it was. I knew the outcome. But there was a sense of terror that had me on the edge of my couch.<br/><br/>College-produced film? Maybe. That's what they called ""Night of the Living Dead.""

Only one comes out and the footage found is their film. The Last Broadcast was completed in July 1997, a full fifteen months before the final edit of the Blair Witch Project was completed and two years before Blair Witch came into theatres. Personally, I haven't seen the Last Broadcast, so I don't know if it's as bad as Blair Witch, but save your money. The Blair Witch Project is NOT scary and extremely boring!

That was why I went to see the film.  The execution of this idea, is where the movie falls way short. I got with the spirit early on, but by the time the lame excuses and frustrations are bantered about for about the four hundredth time, you find yourself wanting it to end quickly.  The only thing scary was the seasick look on my face while trying to persevere in watching the bouncing frames until the end, which came far too late and was disappointing to say the least.  It becomes obvious through the utter lack of preparation and resourcefulness on the part of the characters that they don't belong on a cub scout day hike, much less orienteering through deep woods.  Perhaps this should be chalked up to artistic license, but I would like to know where they bought the batteries for their video cameras, because I can't get mine to last for 45 minutes of shooting, must less 3-4 days in the damp woods.

At first, the method was VERY convincing and I found myself thinking that the story might somehow be REAL.  Unfortunately, about halfway through I'd had enough and was actually squirming, wanting to get up and leave.

We are presented with a supposedly true story (not once is the third person used in the narrative) and this is what's supposed to be so scary about the movie.

","Blair Witch Project may be one of the more inventive ideas to come to the big screen in a long time. It takes a lost in the woods struggle of Deliverence, a slasher film premise and films it in a style so much like Man Bites Dog that the film makers had to have seen Man Bites Dog. There are cetin key elements however to watching the movie with optimum veiwing pleasure. One of those is the whole marketing campaign built around it, especially the sci fi channel special. Secondly I had seen this movie twice in the theaters, once in an art house theater on opening night and the second time in a giant super plex. The movies scariness is tripled by seeing it in a small very private theater, it adds to the real feeling of the movie. Seeing it in an auditorium with people munching on pop corn and teenagers talking detracts infinetly from it's feeling of reality that the makers tried to aim for. Substantial amounts of credit need to go to the film makers for their filming techniques. Such as not filling in the actors on all the plot details. Brilliant but partial inadvertant acting from the actors make this movie feel as though you could have filmed it yourself. One other thing that sets this movie apart is that there are no big shocks in it, the scariness of it all comes from letting the imagination get way ahead of you. See it with Man Bites Dog and compare the numerous similarities. Give it an 8 out of 10"
"zorchmag","8","0","0","12 September 1999"," Pretty scary, but...
","I went into this movie not knowing any of the (apparently quite extensive) backstory, or having been exposed to much of the (also apparently quite extensive) hype. The only reason I went was that my best friend who, unlike myself, actually enjoys horror movies, dragged me. I dislike horror movies; I do not enjoy being scared at all.<br/><br/>That said, I found the film's execution to be extremely effective. It scared me a lot more than gallons of blood and incessant computer-generated special effects could have. The reason is that it had very little overt shock material. Instead, it built up a creepy atmosphere and let the audience' imagination fill in the blanks. The fact that it was filmed in a quasi-realistic manner, without any discernible production values, made willing suspension of disbelief that much easier. There was no soundtrack to remind you ""hey, this is a movie."" There were no special effects. The footage was not a perfect, obviously studio-polished product. It was essentially a 90-minute campfire ghost story.<br/><br/>In short, I suspect that anyone with a functioning imagination will be frightened by this movie. Anyone who approaches it from a purely passive standpoint (""I'm not going to think at all while I watch this."") will not be scared, because the movie never actually shows anything scary; it just prods you into frightening yourself, which in the end is far more effective than if it had ended with some Lovecraftian horror popping out and devouring Our Heroes. There will always be someone out there who says ""Hmm... I always pictured Cthulhu as being more of a purplish colour."" However, by avoiding any direct encounter with the monster, no one is disappointed. Their imagination will come up with something that is frightening to them, without having to worry about what the filmmakers thought would look/sound/act scary."

"Jabba H.","Null","0","0","10 August 1999"," A movie that does different things for different people
","I think I can sum up with ease the reason that the Blair Witch Project has gotten mixed reviews from mixed people: It is a movie that requires a vivid imagination.  Someone who is unlikely to be carried away by their imagination and finds it hard to suspend disbelief will be considerably less likely to enjoy this movie than someone who is more subject to wild trips of the imagination.  Since Blair Witch shows precious little to the camera itself, leaving most of the action unseen and the horrors undepicted, a person with a vivid imagination will usually create a more horrifying image and atmosphere in their mind of what is going on than anything that could actually have been shown on the camera.  So, basically, whether this film scares the bejeezus out of you or leaves you feeling disaffected and saying ""What was so scary about all that?"" is a good test of how imaginative you are.  I myself had a decidedly difficult time of trying to fall asleep last night after seeing the movie, for my imagination was running wild. Hard-core movie fans, like those at the Sundance festival, are likely to be very visual and imaginative people - dreamers - and perhaps this is why the movie went over so well there.  Within the general populace however, people are not always so imaginative and do not find it so easy to let their imaginations take a hold of them.  This is the reason, I believe, that the Blair Witch has encountered more mixed reviews from its wider release."

The basis of this film's financial success will be on the curiosity-seekers scurrying to see what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>There are holes in this story large enough to steam cargo ships through. Most of these revolve around the character's motivations.

If grown men were unable to sleep after seeing this, then they should talk to the psychologist from ""The Sixth Sense."""

","Good movie, well-written, well-executed. The acting of the three principals was totally convincing and the film very economically established their individual personalities and the relationships between them. In total, the film was 100% believable. So far so good.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, however, it is little more than a sanitized retread of Ruggero Deodato's 1979 exploitation classic 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Deodato's film is gory and dubious as hell. Especially hard to stomach are its scenes of real animal slaughter as its team of beleagured documentarians find food where they can in the dense tropical jungle.<br/><br/>But the plot of Deodato's film develops thus: an expedition into the jungle finds the remains of a group of missing documentary film-makers. The remaining three-quarters of the film consists of their unedited rushes, replete with scratches, lab marks etc. Shots are out-of-focus, without sound or damaged. All these elements are shamelessly plagarised by the makers of 'Blair Witch'.<br/><br/>Likewise, Deodato's actors do all the camera work using two cameras in much the same way as the 'Blair Witch' teens. The use of alternating video and 16mm is 'Blair Witch's single technical innovation.<br/><br/>Blah blah blah, I could go on. The point is that I feel that the 'Blair Witch' boys owe a significant debt of gratitude to Deodato, who was himself no monkey, having worked as Roberto Rosselini's assistant for many years and worked his way up the neo-realist ladder. His career peaked with the brilliant and highly original 'Cannibal Holocaust'.<br/><br/>I am sure the same will finally be said of the makers of the brilliant, highly unoriginal 'Blair Witch Project'.<br/><br/>On the other hand, God bless them for kicking the ass of 'The Haunting'."

"Hoots","Null","0","0","9 August 1999"," What is suggested is much more terrifying than what is shown...
","There are pretty much two types of horror movies these days: 1) the too-hip for their own good teenagers running around in a self-conscious kid oriented slasher flick kind, and 2) the 'Alien' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' direct to video rip-offs starring eighties cop shows and sitcom stars and talk-show hosts that usually contain one word in the title that is reminiscent from the latest horror theatrical hit(see 1) and is chock full of every cinematic cliche in the book. So imagine my suprise when the cast and crew of ""The Blair Witch Project"" created one of the most terrifying movies ever made. This movie works for many different reasons. One is that it brings terror to the average person again, which most classic horror movies do. Another is the fantastic and believable acting by the three main actors, which makes their descent into horror even more scary. But the main reason is the terror is suggested and the three filmakers stalker is never shown, making people use their imagination. This movie proves that a man's imagination is a lot scarier than the average gorefest."

These guys give such a stark sense of realism and utter dread with their performances that you feel like you're w/these poor kids in the haunted woods. This is an EXTREMELY SCARY, DISTURBING MOVIE, like Faces of Death w/o the blood and guts, but even more freaky because of what's just past the edge of your vision in the dark-what the hell WAS that in the shadows, anyway?

","The Blair Witch Project - ***<br/><br/>In October of 1994, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams hiked into Maryland's Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary about a local legend, ""The Blair Witch.""  They vanished, never to be heard from again.  One year later, their footage was found.  It records the filmmakers' frightening five-day journey into the woods and captures the events that led up to their disappearance.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project was unveiled to the world at the Sundance Film Festival, where it generated tremendous buzz.  Glowing word of mouth has followed the picture ever since.  Critical quotes such as ""Scary as hell"" and ""The scariest film since the Exorcist"" have been splashed across newspaper and television ads.  Audience interest is so high that the two screens in Washington, DC which run the film sell out days in advance. Given all of this hype, my disappointment in the movie was inevitable.  If you walk into the theater expecting the scariest experience of your life, chances are you will be let down.  However, I suspect that if I had walked into the movie cold, with no expectations and no knowledge of the hype or the reception in Park City, I would have been pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>To be clear, The Blair Witch Project is not a true documentary.  The three people we follow are portraying themselves, and the Maryland locations are authentic.  But the actions are staged (as are the fates of the characters.) Unlike Drop Dead Gorgeous (another mockumentary), this one is so believable, so successful in its authenticity, that many people are fooled into thinking it is real.  Directors Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick shoot only in 16mm and High-8, the film stocks available to the three lead characters.  While this crudity of form sometimes impinges on the viewer's ability to discern what is happening (what IS that wrapped in the cloth!?!), it is essential in establishing the documentary's authenticity.  Indeed, the unclear sound and the limited night vision only add to the movie's bag of scary tricks.  The Blair Witch Project, with its low budget and documentary feel, relies upon implied menace to scare its audience.  It does not use CGI or state of the art make-up effects.  It uses piles of rocks and twigs bound together.  (I'm not kidding.)  I rather enjoyed this new slant on terror, and admired the ingenuity employed to actually make piles of rocks menacing.<br/><br/>The film possesses a certain streak of artfulness not typically found in a Hollywood horror movie.  I was particularly intrigued by an implied theme about moviemaking in general: It must be lived to be authentic.  Three students set out to film a movie about a scary legend.  But when they get lost in the woods, they forget about shooting their planned documentary and instead shoot ""behind the scenes"" footage of the trio's quest for civilization.  Only when they deviate from the script and abandon any pretense of being outsiders or observers do they REALLY document the power of the Blair Witch legend.  In essence, they must become a part of the story in order to capture the story.  The entire form of the film, a mock documentary, serves to emphasize this principle.<br/><br/>Is it scary?  Yeah, sure.  It is scary in the same way that most horror films are scary - some guy is walking backwards through the dark and you just know he is going to get an ice pick in the eye.  But it is not bone-chilling terrifying, like The Exorcist or The Shining.  Quite to the contrary, the first two thirds of the movie is quite funny as it traces our filmmaker's journey through Burkittsville while interviewing the locals. Only in the final act does the tension really take hold.  Even then, it does not reach its stride until the final sequence, when our intrepid filmmakers stumble upon that house..."

","When I began voluntarily reading novels in my early teens, my author of choice was Stephen King. I've always felt his stories (with some notable exceptions) were best left in book form, because too many special effects were required to make them into movies. To me, that's the problem with most horror films. You see enough gore, and it's like you're a doctor working in an emergency room. You become unaffected by it. The Blair Witch Project was different. The scariest thing on earth is the unknown, and in Blair Witch, less is most definitely more. No special effects or musical soundtrack is needed. You see fright developing in the characters' faces, their voices and the progressive shakiness of the camera work. Being in the woods, even if you are not lost, is a fertile breeding ground for fear. In broad daylight, there are unidentifiable noises that spook, and at night it's even worse. This was by far the scariest movie I've ever seen. I didn't want to drive home in the dark."

","This ""movie"" is really a student short that was stretched to feature length. Absolutely nothing of interest or even remotely scary happens in the first hour (unless you have an inordinate fear of dying of boredom).  The characters are so annoying (especially Heather) that you begin to wish the witch will come kill them.  At one point (semi-spoiler warning), when one of the characters disappears I actually wondered if perhaps he had left to go find a better movie.  The ending (which is purported to be ""disturbing"") is utterly predictable and was foreshadowed about as subtly as Oliver Stone would have done.<br/><br/>I'm not exaggerating when I say that no one, not ONE person in the theater I was at ever once gasped or cried out in fear.

","I thought the concept for this film was highly original and fairly well-executed. Not being a fan of horror/thriller, I was quite worried that I'd be terrified, as EVERYONE I spoke with said the movie was very, very scary (my sister would not go camping after she saw it). Well, perhaps I'm jaded because I'm in my thirties, but there was only one point in the film where I was moderately startled. I was never terrified, or even remotely disturbed. While I understand the device of having the discovered footage that the three film makers shot on their quest for the witch, it was this very device that kept me too distanced to be scared. If you're really terrified by all the weird goings on and so on, I'm sorry, no matter how dedicated a film maker you are, you don't switch on your video camera. Obviously the film could not have been made without making this assumption, but I was never convinced that there was anything that scary, because the characters always had the presence of mind to turn their cameras on. Still, it's worth seeing if you're interested in how video looks blown up to 35 mm. Just one additional note: if you are prone to motion sickness, you'd be well-advised to take some gravol or wear sea bands.

If you want to understand the ending you have got to pay very close attention to what the people say when the kids are interviewing them. It is a total documentary of the footage of these kids making the film.  The film they  found a year after their disappearance.  The Blair witch web site is very informative on how detailed the investigation got.....which is something you never see in the actual movie.  I would say this is a good movie but if it had the interviews with the kids parents or the cops searching or something other than just a jumpy camera it would have been better.

","The terror this film promises depends on the viewer's ability to identify with the characters and to feel their emotions... this in turn relies on the actors' ability to convey those emotions with some verisimiltude, enough to deceive the mind into seeing the story as real.  For some viewers, it works. For me and apparently for many others, it doesn't.  Of the friends of mine who saw the movie with me, some were terrified while others were bored and restless.  Some saw the world through the characters' eyes and felt their fear, while the rest of us found both the acting and the plot implausible. In defense of the latter, I can't imagine that the students had read their survival book they proudly displayed early in the film if they didn't know to follow the stream they kept crossing to find their way to civilization. But to the point, the filmmakers managed to capture the attention of some of the audience and lose the others... in short, they did a halfway job.  I was disappointed, given the hype surrounding it.

It was kind of creepy and it had an overall real effect, plus the ending just kicks.<br/><br/>Plot:  Three kids making a documentery dissappear, and then their footage is found.  Basically you watch their documentary.  The movie is, although I have heard that it resembles The Last Broadcast, which I have not seen, is unlike any other movie I have ever seen.  It feels like a documentary.  If you become creeped out, just think that it is only a movie. <br/><br/>
Acting:  Resembled the actual downfall of human thinking.  It was superb and realistic.  You actually feel that the people are reacting to what is around them.  You will know these people and what makes them tick by the end of the movie.  It will feel like they are your friends.  In fact, their personalities are quite common.<br/><br/>This movie was a genuinely creepy movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone, with Dramamine.  Or just wait for video.  But, if you can get past it, see it with everyone else at the theater.  You will be shocked with everyone else.  Although not a jumpy movie, it will freak you out of your mind.---------9"

","This is a comment I overhead from a female audience member as the movie ended.  I must confess, I felt somewhat the same way. This movie has been ""hyped"" so much, that it has almost become a ""don't miss"" movie -- and the viewing I attended was nearly full.  Although the film did create interest, and build a certain amount of tension, it never-the-less at times had the feel of an episode from MTV's ""Real Life.""  I mean, a lot of it was about the interactional dynamics among the group members.  The supernatural, for me, was almost secondary.  The ending is somewhat creepy, but was also hard to follow . . . the cheap, home-movie feel became a bit tiresome after a while.  I told my daughter, on the way to the theater, ""There is no way this movie is going to live up to the expectation."" -- and, it didn't."

","I have just returned from seeing for myself what the hype was about. The first 3 times i tried to see it, it was sold out. Therefore, the anticipation was in full bloom by the time I finally got a ticket. At first I was a little up in the air about how I felt about the movie. However thats one of the tricks of the film, it gets under your skin, if not while you're watching it, after you leave. I was blown away! I am and avid horror fan, but just like many horror fans, I have been waiting years for a good one to come out. Horror has become a joke in the film industry...Please people, wisecracking maniacs, and slashers who won't die is getting a little old....ok, it's been old! But fear not fright fans ""The Blair Witch Project"" will restore your faith in horror. I heard many mixed comments on the way out of the theater, from; ""I cant believe I paid to see that!""  to ""I'll never go in the woods again."" You either love it or hate it, no in between. The last 10 minutes of the film leave you yearning for another 10, but somehow the mystery behind it makes it even better.  I have yet to see a movie that scared me, ever..but this one had me looking over my shoulder all night....I gotta see it again!!!...By the way, my local video store owner told me that it was due on video and dvd in October and that she had already ordered her copies...that soon??..any truth to this??..If anyone knows please drop me an e-mail!"
"Girt","Null","0","0","7 August 1999"," Not your average horror flick, but chilling nonetheless
","I was really hyped up about this film from hearing all of the reviews and other things about it, and of course I decided that I had to see it as soon as it came out in the local theater.  So I caught it opening night amidst a packed theater and I came away from the experience with almost a sense of awe at the film.  It was obviously not what I had expected, I had read reviews and comments, both negative and positive, but they had still not prepared me for the type of movie that this was.  Do not go and expect this movie to be a normal slasher flick that is so common now, this film tries to draw on the terror of three young people lost, starving, and hunted.  Of course this may not be the kind of terror that people are accustomed to seeing when they go to see a scary movie, and some people will leave the theater simply shaking their heads and saying ""Well what was so scary about that??""  The truth is that it may not be the kind of scary movie where you jump out of your seat at a shock scene, but the horror is much deeper than that.  If you follow the movie completely and actually identify with the characters, then by the end of the movie you will understand why people have been calling this the scariest movie ever.  The actors play their parts very realisticly, and their actions are completely believable for their situation.  The final sixty seconds of the movie is easily the scariest part of the movie, and the last image of the movie will haunt some people well after the movie is over.  So my opinion on the film is that it is a total must-see movie, but be warned... if you're looking for shock value go elsewhere.  If you want a movie that deals with real terror then go and see this movie."

Sure, we weren't startled out of our seats by loud, sudden noises or gory faces in huge close-up holding machetes.  But is that what it takes to be scary to moviegoers now?<br/><br/>I don't know... maybe it's because I grew up in Maryland and used to go out to the woods with my high-school friends to shoot ""documentaries"" all the time.  Maybe it's because I lived down the street from Montgomery College (where they supposedly attended school) and had been to an abandoned house at night with a hand-held videocamera.  Maybe it's because our videos looked a lot like that before we edited them, and we were too scared to stay out overnight.<br/><br/>It's not what's thrown in your face that's truly scary, it's what you can't see.  What you don't know for sure.  The final scene of the movie was terrifying to me, but I heard that many people didn't get it.  I don't want to put a spoiler here, so I won't say what confused people.  But if you're looking to be told when, how, and by what you should be scared/startled, go see The Haunting.  Lots of special effects and loud noises await you.<br/><br/>What scared me in Blair Witch is that I could actually relate to the situation.  It wasn't like watching beautiful actors go through some scripted lines while screaming in their high heels and perfect hair.

","I say 'criminally underrated' because there seem to be two schools of thought concerning this movie. The first appreciate how much this film does with so little resources, i.e. these people take the time to enjoy it and become engrossed throughout by the well structured tension... The second school switch off early because of the lack of a horrific CGI witch flying around tearing people apart for the sake of it, thus dubbing it as 'boring' because 'nothing happens'... i.e. those people don't appreciate how this film rejects visuals in favour of a well-thought out developed story.<br/><br/>Blair Witch Project (BWP), is absolute minimalist genius when you consider how little happens in it... yet so much happens! It's a slow build up of tension based around reasonable sounding lore in an environment that we could all imagine ourselves being in. Horror films have regressed so much in recent years, mainly because jump scares become too commonplace to be scary, the visuals are too far-fetched and the back stories are horribly written. BWP addresses all of these by putting the audience into such a real scenario, at no point is there any hard evidence of the supernatural...and it is that very insecurity that keeps things interesting!<br/><br/>You need only read the wealth of trivia to appreciate what the writers and actors went through to make this all happen. One piece of trivia claims that we were supposed to get a flash of the Blair Witch herself at one point for a brief moment but due to a cameraman error this didn't happen... personally I think it's better that way and always believed that part of the mystery was not being able to see her.<br/><br/>Found footage films haven't had a good hit in a while, personally I don't think any could top this one.

I guess we just get to make up the rest, ourselves. Use your imagination, folks.<br/><br/>Anyway, they then get lost in the woods (boy, what a surprise) due to the fact that, in their boundless wisdom, they decide that it would be a good idea to trust in the acuity of the derpiest of all three of them (Heather) to perform land navigation for them, while having absolutely no understanding of land navigation, themselves, with one of them literally describing the map as being ""Greek"" to him.<br/><br/>They wander around the woods for days with predictably spooky things happening to them that could, I guess, kinda, in some way, vaguely resemble things involving witchcraft (like I said; use your imagination) that escalates with every night that goes by. Apart from that we're treated to a farting-in-the-tent joke, a lot of yelling and arguing, an excessive, insipid and obnoxious use of profanity, and a lot completely uneventful meandering around the woods.<br/><br/>There is a light at the end of the tunnel, however; they all die. You don't get to see what happens, but it can be assumed that their fearless leader gets cracked over the head with a blunt object.

"eric262003","8","2","5","21 February 2016"," A Horror Film Where Fear is The Real Monster
","In the 1999 horror classic ""The Blair Witch Project"", we see three aspiring young filmmakers in 1994 set out on journey to do a documentary project based on a mysterious urban legend of the Blair Witch, who resides in a forest outside of a small town in Maryland. At first we're given the impression that this film was based off of their raw footage. The research going into the documentary is pretty shoddy in execution. The camera is purely out of focus and plus that Heather (Heather Donahue) repetitively utilizes ""u-huhs and yeahs"" when she's asking questions towards the residents in the area. The opening scenes will surely make you gnash your teeth in annoyance. In fact this whole movie within a movie can be contrived at times. But once the young students enter the woods in search of the Blair Witch, the annoyance becomes more paranoiac as the fears and the anxieties start to send chills down our spines. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the real filmmakers (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) were not as inept as the student filmmakers. We get some believable settings as the determined crew makes their way into the Maryland forests, where they are lost and the more trapped they are in the labyrinth of tress and shrubs, the more the adrenaline level goes up rapidly as the fears and paranoia become overwhelming. The daytime scenes start off quite equivocal as just the sounds of twigs from tree or on the ground snap can surely garner scares where expect the unexpected becomes focal in our minds as much as theirs. The rock piles that bear a resemblance of grave markers epitomizes a sense of unsettling tension of the students as though their eyes are playing tricks on them. These supernatural elements that the threesome face would likely drive anyone insane. <br/><br/>The daytime fears seem pretty tame at first because the paranormal activity doesn't generate as much fear as the gang might shed some hope of finding their ways out of the woods, if they could trace back to where they begun their journey. When night comes and when things go bump in the night, the fear factor really gets the boost. The strange sounds nearby can be chillingly frightful and our brave but naive, unequipped students can do nothing but stick together. But nightfall the horror party finally gets tense and the audience watching this can feel this level of fear that anyone sneaking up behind them in the theaters can get someone a cardiac arrest. The forest is black, the theater is dark, everything is painted black during these scenes. <br/><br/>The main prop in this movie is the cheap first-person camcorder which eventually becomes a character in itself as we become a part of this movie courtesy of the camera as well as the terror the gang faces it lingers on us as well as we feel convinced that there might be a Blair Witch lurking in these forests. These camera traits show adults that it is normal that human beings are scared of the dark and nothing shameful about that. <br/><br/>The lack of preparation when entering the woods, the students have been faced in a sort of predicament they can't seem to get out of and the more they struggle the worst it gets. When Heather the booger- dripping leader of the team she confesses that it was her stubborn ways and determination to finding the truth she begs her cohorts Josh and Michael for forgiveness, we actually feel for her without the audience feeling manipulated.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is utilized as a staple on why we're obligated to watch and let alone produce films. When the students start to get restless, hungry and feared, Heather decides that now's the time to close the camera. Finally, the more restrained Joshua takes her camera and retaliates by pointing it back at her and shouting back at her as though, the camera rules her life while it affects the other two characters caught in the middle of the mess she put them in. In some ways this movie helped spawn shows like ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Ghost Adventures"" where paranormal experts go around the world in seek of the truth in that there is life beyond our mortal lives."

","The found footage stereotype doesn't apply here. A lot of people don't like this movie because the witch isn't shown. That's exactly why it's brilliant. If they had used special effects and shown the witch, this movie would be outdated and silly. Without the witch, there is just the idea of the witch. We know that they've gone in circles and we see them go crazy. The only confirmation of the witch that was needed was the ending. It's the story that they tell about the boys in the cabin. It's more of a psychological movie than it is a gory horror movie. The whole thing is about the idea of paranormal activity. It's the most terrifying movie I've ever seen."

There is know way you were scared of this. And if you really were scared of this then the real reason you don't like Plan 9 from outer space is because it made you pooh in your pants.

","If you're still stuck in any time before 2005, and haven't seen any found footage type films, or if you're one of those people that think all Indie films are instantly masterpieces purely because it's Indie no matter how terrible it is, or if seeing three tired teenagers arguing through a shaky camera lens entertains you, you might find this film interesting. Otherwise, this film is absolutely terrible. Definitely not a film you should waste your time on if you want a scare. It consists of 10% people telling a story followed by 80% of arguing teenagers, 9% crying and the final 1% is a slightly tense moment, but probably only made intense because you think something more exciting than exhausted, depressed teenagers arguing and crying might happen. <br/><br/>I can see how this gained it's popularity on release due to it being an original take on horror films in relation to the films in it's era.

","This is by far the scariest horror movie ever and I have seen a lot. Intense thriller, found footage categorized, this is very realistic to the core. And the idea that there is no reveal of the 'scary characters' that is normally expected towards the movie ending makes it more realistic and scarier.<br/><br/>During the course of the movie, you will love (or hate) the characters surely it doesn't matter but you'll get attached to what is happening out there. How many ever times I watched, it gives me a chill down my spine while watching few scenes in the movie, which I have rarely felt watching other movies in this genre.<br/><br/>Ten stars to the makers and director!"
"GusF","Null","2","5","14 March 2015"," An absolutely brilliant horror film
","Although this can safely be called one of the films that defined the 1990s, I had never seen it before. The film was not the first of the found footage genre but it is nevertheless an incredibly innovative film. The information about the Blair Witch and Rustin Parr is related to the audience early in the film through interviews with the people of Burkittsville, most of whom dismiss the stories about the Witch as nothing more than a local legend. This is a very clever idea as most towns have stories about ghosts which few take seriously. For instance, there is a castle not two miles from where I live which is supposedly haunted! The stories are regarded by Heather, Josh and Mike as cool material for their documentary but nothing more than that, certainly not as a warning for things to come. It foreshadows their later trouble for the audience but not the characters.<br/><br/>The writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were able to give a new spin to a very old idea: that what you don't see is more frightening than what you do. This technique is used repeatedly and very effectively in the film with the noises that the characters hear at night. Several of these scenes take place in almost complete darkness, adding to the effect. The film was made on the cheap over a mere eight days and features no real special effects, instead relying on humanity's ancient and instinctual fear of the unknown to provide its scares rather than digitally rendered gods and monsters. Things like the weird, life size stick figures are enough to creep us out!<br/><br/>The three lead actors Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams - who all use their real names - shot almost all of the film personally. They were given an outline of the plot but improvised the dialogue themselves. They interrupt each other and occasionally stumble over their words, giving the film a wonderfully authentic quality. This is helped by the fact that Heather, Josh and Mike all have flaws and seem like real people. <br/><br/>None of them are especially pleasant people to begin with. As their situations worsens, we see them all go through waves of anger, upset and hysteria to the point that they're borderline unstable. Many of us would try to deny it but I think that 99% of people would react the same way. The fact that Heather keeps recording when logic would dictate that they drop the camera is explained by the fact that it helps her to cope. I would ditch it the first chance that I got but I can well imagine other people holding on to it for the same reason as Heather. There isn't a single part of their behaviour that doesn't ring true. Roger Ebert compared her wonderfully acted (and later much parodied!) apology to the camera to Robert Scott's final diary entries before he froze to death in the Antarctic and I think that that says it best.<br/><br/>I don't usually comment on the promotional side of films but I think that it is worth mentioning in this case. It was one of the first films to be very heavily marketed on the Internet, something which we take for granted today but was groundbreaking in its day. A mockumentary - which, oddly enough, I had seen - was made to promote the film as were several tie-in websites concerning Burkittsville and the police investigation into the disappearances. It was essentially an attempt to do deliberately online what Orson Welles had done accidentally on the radio in 1938. It led to numerous debates as to whether the film was fiction or an actual documentary. We were all far too young to (officially!) see the film but I remember talking about with my friends in school at the time. This kind of campaign would probably not work in 2015 but it was a fantastic idea in 1999."
"ElectricWarlock","10","2","5","5 March 2013"," A brilliant horror movie
","This is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The main reason I love it is because it leaves everything up to the imagination of the viewer. It doesn't show you the villain (whoever or whatever it may be), so you have to decide for yourself what is happening. This film gives the viewer just as large of a role in the film as it does with the characters. I can't think of many films that do that, so this film is truly one of a kind. If you don't have an imagination and like to have every detail of a film spoonfed to you, this film is not the one for you. This is a horror film that actually requires the viewer to think, and not all viewers like to do that, so that's one of the main reasons many seem to dislike it.<br/><br/>This film doesn't need cheap gore, brutal death scenes, tasteless nudity, or even overly loud jump scares. It relies solely on suspense and atmosphere. Every moment of the film captures the viewer's interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what is going to happen next. The amount of tension this film builds is horrifying. There is a brooding atmosphere that permeates the entire film. The second you see the characters, you can sense that something bad is going to happen and you dread it. You really feel sorry for the characters and sympathize with the situation they're going through. This is due to the amazing performances from Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. You can't tell they're acting at all. It seems as if they're truly in danger.<br/><br/>If you like subtle, intelligent horror films that are truly about being scary rather than blood, gore, and loud noises, this is the film for you. If not, then perhaps you would be better off watching something else."

","It makes me sad to see all these negative reviews by people who have been brought up on cheap horror flicks with no real scare value. I have watched MANY horror movies, and none of them have stuck with me like this one. It's easy to make the audience jump, but it's another thing entirely to make them lay in their beds at night and be TERRIFIED. I've seen many people say that this movie looks like it was made by amateurs, and to them I say: That's the point!! It is not supposed to be a movie about people making a documentary, it's supposed to be the documentary they made! If you were lost in the woods with something chasing you, how good would your filming be? The actors are also fantastic, because they are so realistic. They act like normal human beings, mostly because the script was largely improvised. You feel their terror and confusion, and you want them to get out alive. The thing about this movie that scared me the most was the fact that everything is left to your imagination. Nothing explicit is seen, there is no gore, just some incredibly eerie sounds coming from the woods. And that is what sticks with you after the movie is over more than any killer popping out of a closet could."
"nvillesanti","9","2","5","10 April 2012"," Blair will never let you go
","I remember back in 1999, this film was marketed as a real event and that the events you were seeing were true and these people have actually disappeared. Of course, that wasn't the case but marketing it this way lured people to go see it, including me. Never have I seen such a film so original, that engaged me, and made me believe that what I was seeing was true since ""Cannibal Holocaust."" <br/><br/>It is set in 1994 when a group of three student filmmakers were filming a documentary on a legendary witch known as Blair in Burkittsville, Maryland. As they go deeper into the woods they get lost and every night they hear strange sounds coming from the woods but they can't make what it is or where it comes from. As the days go by, they succumb in desperation as they can't find a way out of the dense woods. But even more horrifying is that someone or something is hunting them.<br/><br/>After leaving the theater back in 1999, this movie would just not leave my mind for days. The acting was unbelievable, even more coming from unknown threesome of actors. It was shot in a first person point of view with the actors being the ones holding the camera giving it a new sense of realism, now this wasn't absolutely new style of filming. Cannibal Holocaust was filmed the same way but it hasn't been done in a long time. Also you never see what is hunting them; the movie forces the viewers to use their imagination and to fill in the gabs. Nowadays many movies try to copy the filming style of The Blair Witch but fall short. But what was even more amazing is that this little independent film, with a budget of nearly $30,000, earned over 240 million dollars at the box office. That is something you don't see every day.<br/><br/>This film don't have the eye candy and gore other horror films have or elaborate setting or big names, it is simple, creative and extremely effective and I would dare say it is up there with films such as ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" This film is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema and I strongly recommended it."

","Who would've thought that a movie filmed in grainy camera quality and by a completely unknown cast and crew would still be remembered and talked about to this day. Despite being eleven years old, this movie doesn't feel dated at all and remains incredibly horrifying. Everything about this movie hits the bullseye. The three actors are all magnificent, especially Heather Donahue, who's gut-wrenching (and often parodied) final confession to the camera is truly chilling. The shaky camera effects are poor quality, but that's what make this film so believable. And although this isn't the first time that a first-person perspective has been used, this is definitely the most well done version. The movie just feels so raw in its presentation and every little thing about it works in. But what really makes this film stand out (at least to me) is the fact that the audience is never given a view of the monster. In nearly every single horror film, we are given the chance to at least get a glimpse of the thing causing all of the death and destruction, however it's left entirely up to the imagination as to what's really going on. So many questions are left unanswered by the end and it's definitely for the better. ""Blair Witch"" is a movie that truly redefined the horror genre, opening the door for a wave of imitators and copycats. Even if you're not a horror fan, you should still at least check this wonderful piece of cinema out."
"kayozz2001","3","2","5","8 November 2009"," The Blair Witch project
","Three Americans get lost in the woods. Terrible camera work made itlook very amateur, i'm pretty sure the director even tried to cheat the audience by using two cameras (one of which is obviously noticeable as it is black and white). No music either which is a shame, as i'm pretty sure some of the scenes could have done with some hammer horror style chords and screeches. The lack of any on screen antagonist also decreases its credibility. Although at one point you CAN hear an owl. The three so called actors aren't that good, as i've never seen them in anything else. Another bad move for the director. I think this film would have worked far better with Nicolas Cage, Steve Buscemi and Salma Hayek as the main actors.<br/><br/>Basically lots of shouting, rustling and screaming for about 90 minutes."
"Tweekums","8","2","5","8 January 2009"," If you go down to the woods tonight...
","I'd heard rather a lot of hype about this film before seeing it, I'm not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing, on the one hand few films live up to their hype on the other without that hype I probably wouldn't have seen it at all. While I don't think it is the ""scariest movie ever made"" it is certainly very creepy and makes the viewer feel that they are lost in the woods with the protagonists.<br/><br/>At the start of the film we are told that three students, Heather, Josh and Mike, disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville (formerly called Blair) in Maryland while investigating the local legend and that a year later their equipment had been found and what we are then shown is the film recorded by them before their disappearance. Once the three of them have joined up and got their equipment together they head to Burkittsville where they interview some of the locals about the legends before heading off in to the woods to film the sites where the events in the legend are alleged to have taken place. All goes fairly well until the trio try to return to their car, while camping over night they here strange noises outside their tent and the next day despite following the map they don't manage to find their car. The same happens the next day and the next etc. as the days progress they get more and more distressed, especially as whatever is outside the tent each night is leaving strange items in the trees and messing with their equipment.<br/><br/>I have tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum as the less you know about what happens in the woods the more disturbing the film is likely to be. If you are put off horror films by gore then this is a safe film to watch as there is almost no gore, the scares all come from being lost while some one or something is messing with your head. The way that it is filmed also adds to the atmosphere, quite often the camera is pointing and something away from the action or in the night scenes there is no image at all, just sound. The acting was very natural probably because most of it was unscripted."

Heather was in command of the three-some until they really did get lost in the forest and the precious map was thrown into the river. From there on, the three were hopelessly lost in the woods without food, matches for a fire. They became more and more frightened and began loosing their sense of self and sanity.

The college, frat boy crowd who hate this film cannot give an answer, unless they admit that their is some collective insanity that made every important critic in the country get scammed by this so-called bad movie. You and I both doubt this, so this must mean that either you cannot fathom a decent horror movie, or you are sold on the premise that only computer animation and boo/gore effects make a horror movie shine.<br/><br/>This is one of the great horror movies of all time, not because of the look of the film, but because of the smart idea of the making of the film and the way the inspiration of the amateur actors seem to gel so completely, almost too perfectly. Everything seemed to work right, even though so much could have gone wrong. The looks on the actors faces, the real fear and real anger made for a great movie, that could have been the bad movie, talentless detractors think it is.<br/><br/>Here is why this movie works so well:<br/><br/>The experimental nature could have made the film fail, or not be as interesting, but the actors real uncomfortability with the woods and the things that happen make for a real experience, when it could have looked hooky and planned. Without even suspending disbelief, you never thought the movie was fake. It seemed like these were real college kids looking for a witch. You felt their REAL fear, you felt the cold, could sense your own fear and it made you uncomfortable in a way that is seldom seen in horror films. This is a real experience, that goes beyond campfire fun. The horror, that hides in the shadows seems more real, because you feel it. Most horror movies are fun, but this film is too creepy to be the usual fun horror experience. That is what makes haters hate, they do not want to deal with their own discomfort, about this film, and what it did to them.<br/><br/>The acting is real. They could have been tongue tied, or had shitty words coming from their mouths, but they did do a smashup job and coming up with plausible dialogue. You have to give it to them, since they had so little to work with.<br/><br/>Odd things happen in the film that help the plausibility of the story seem more real. I will not divulge them, but you lovers of this film know what I mean. The directors got very lucky in what happen in the woods. So much could have gone wrong, but didn't.<br/><br/>The greatness of this film is not about art--the film is actually not art at all. It is an experiment that works. Look at it that way and give it another try. Put yourself into the shoes of the campers. Maybe the fear will make more sense.<br/><br/>The haters of this film merely show their ignorance.

During the day the three leads wander around a forest shouting at each other. At night they hear a tiny little sound then run around in the darkness screaming. And I'm talking complete and utter darkness. All there is consists of darkness and screaming. It's boring and not scary at all.

"Apollo-9","10","2","5","6 February 1999"," 100% Pure FEAR! It's the scariest film I've ever seen!
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is the first film I've seen that has truly scared me. I first saw the film at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and was amazed. Even an hour after the film, my adrenaline was pumping.<br/><br/>
The best part about this film, is that it's the unknown, the unexplained, and the unseen which creates such fear. These days, too many films try to scare an audience by using graphic content. Real fear however, I think comes from what we can't see. And this is what makes ""The Blair Witch Project,"" such an incredible film.<br/><br/>Phenomenal acting and an amateur home video approach, draws the viewer into the film so well, that fear can truly be experienced. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is an awesome film that is definitely worth seeing."

","This film has been harshly judged. It is a low-budget film school experimentation and I am going to review it with that in mind.

With the minimal of money the makers, of this over-exposed movie, create a good deal of tension and raw excitement. Of course there are a few logic errors but I'm kind-hearted enough to see past that.<br/><br/>Although this film is shown on a 1.85:1 screen in the cinema the entire movie in is 1.33:1 because it is all shot on video. The photography may be jumpy but it didn't make me seasick like it did to some people. It is a little strange to film everything that is going on but if they didn't there would be no movie. <br/><br/>If Jaws made you feel afraid to go in the water The Blair Witch project will make afraid to go wandering in the woods. <br/><br/>One last thingit's not a true story."

"omeletboy","10","2","5","9 November 1999"," One of a kind
","Reviewed by: Steve Losie<br/><br/>From the opening shot in until the last heart-pounding scene, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is breathtaking. Its style, is easiness, its truth permeates every shot, every inch of this movie. Simply, it is a masterpiece-perhaps the best horror movie ever made. The plot is fairly simple: Josh, Heather, and Mike are film students making a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend in Burkittsville, Maryland. They begin by interviewing several locals, asking them their opinion of the Blair Witch. Before long, they are in the woods where the Blair Witch legend has it that the witch haunts. They shoot a few scenes and then head to a cemetery. Days pass, they don't find the cemetery, and realize that they are lost. Meanwhile, every night they are being scared to death by different odd instances: it starts out with eerie rock poundings and escalates to screaming childrenand then worse. The ending does not provide any twist, but is exhilarating none the less. The writers and directors took an old rehashed idea (""Witches are scary!""), but turned it into an experience. By using handheld cameras, the movie takes you in as a participant. Along with Josh, Heather, and Mike, you too are lost. You become confused, frightened, and weary. One of the most amazing aspects of the movie is its character development. Most of the dialogue was ad-libbed, but the characters transform throughout the movie as the haunting Blair Witch experience eats away at them. From the start, Heather is who we identify most with. She narrates: every thing she sees, we see, and what she hears, we hear. Josh seems to be the laid-back dude who will keep his cool no matter what happens. Mike is the most flappable. He is skeptical and jittery the moment they walk into the forest. As the Blair Witch begins haunting, there are many role reversals. Their very first scare, Mike won't even leave the tent. As time wears on, Josh ""loses it."" A combination of his weariness, the ceaseless hiking, and the horrible nights finally get to Josh and he nearly gives up midday. Heather insists they keep going, but Mike wants to make sure they keep their sanity. Later, Heather bursts into tears. She is emotionally drained. Flipped-out Josh begins pointing the camera on Heather, and she blurts, ""It's all I have left."" They aren't making a movie anymore; they need to keep it together. Through all this, Mike seems to unite them. Whenever a fight occurs or a nervous night wears on, Mike takes control to see that they are okay in the morning. By the last scene, Mike has taken command of the group from Heather, as he is the only one left who hasn't ""lost it."" Some of the highlights of the movie include Mike's admission that he threw the map in the river and the ensuing fight, Heather's tear-filled confessional (which should go down as one of the most personal and truthful monologues in movie history), and the last scene in the spooky old house. A twist here and a twist there keep you on your toes. Still, the way that the movie was made make all the difference. You forget that this is a fake. It feels real. It is real. Where most horror movies work by keeping you on your toes, waiting for what will happen next, this film does the opposite. It utilizes the fear of the unknown. Every night, they know what is coming. They just wait. Day after day, and everything feels so lost and helpless. There is no way out. It is only a matter of time until the inevitable hits. ""The Shining,"" for instance, works by pitting good directly against evil. Nearly every suspenseful moment relies on the fear, ""Can he/she get out of there in time?"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" has an element of the fear (""Will they get out of the woods in time?"") but that soon fades. Other questions are raised, such as ""Will it come back tonight?"" , ""Will we ever find our way out?"", ""Who is chasing us?"", and ""What will happen to us?"" The film works on multiple levels, as well as being an artistically beautiful vision carried out. It is, perhaps, the best picture of 1999. Heather Donahue's performance is particularly outstanding, while the creators-Eduardo Sanchez and David Myrick-deserve nominations for both ""script"" and directing. They took a leap into making a very experimental film, and came out on the other end with one of the most original and exciting movies of all time."

","The Blair Witch Project is known for being an extremely influential horror movie. While it is influental(being it created a new sub genre) everything else in this annoying, lethargic, headache of a movie is completely terrible. I'm convinced that the characters in this movie are amongst the worst in horror movie history. They are more than agitating and all they do the whole movie is argue about a map. They just scream and scream and scream at each other and don't stop. It is infuriating to watch them for 1 and a half hours. The story also goes absolutely nowhere. It starts with somewhat of a promise, but when they go into the woods nothing happens for the rest of the movie(until the horrible last 5 minutes) They walk around lost in a forrest and whine(extensively about the map) and that's pretty much it. It is actually documented that the filmmakers ran out of ideas of what to do with the movie while filming and that the actors improvised most of the lines. You can completely tell because all they do for the runtime is have the same conversations over and over again. They just retread the same material repeatedly. While the The Blair Witch Project admittedly had extremely creative marketing, the film itself is awful. The characters run in circles, the ending is a complete bail out, and unfortunately the movie has completely decayed over time."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","10","25 October 2009"," A Classic in the Genre
","Blair Witch Project, The (1999)<br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The story is known by everyone as three filmmakers go into the wood to tell the story of the Blair Witch and soon they find themselves lost with something apparently coming for them. I remember the hype surrounding this film quite well and I remember my two viewings in the theater when the film originally opened. It's been about six years or more since I last watched the film so I was very curious going in as to how the film would hold up. After viewing the film I think it still holds up remarkably well and even though the hype has died down and much hates has been thrown upon the film, it still remains a rather chilling and all too realistic venture into basic fears. I think these basic fears can be the dark, being lost or hearing something when you shouldn't be hearing anything. These are three elements that make this film so effective because there isn't any blood, no monster, no killer and whatever is out there is something we never see. I think the greatness of the film, and something very important, is that the viewer is put into the action to where you can feel everything that the three filmmakers are going through. If you can imagine yourself lost in the woods then you should be able to know the fears going on with the filmmakers here. The movie does a marvelous job at various things but one is the start of the thing when we learn the history of the curse through the documentary set up. A perfect move. We hear from locals, various myths and then we slowly get put into the action. The set up wasn't original as the ""lost video footage"" was used in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST nearly twenty years earlier but the effectiveness of this film is that it takes that lost footage and uses it again the viewer to assault their fears. The performances are all very raw but that makes them effective in terms of everything going on. The direction and use of two cameras is also very effective but the most chilling aspect of the film is without a doubt its ending. I won't spoil anything but the final shot before the hit still send chills down my spine no matter how many times I've seen the film. Over the years this film has found many critics to hate on it but this is something that happens with countless popular horror films, which is a real shame. In a day and age where we can see anything, it's refreshing to watch a movie like this that shows us absolutely nothing yet works on every level."

"Leofwine_draca","10","2","6","21 December 2015"," A film that turned me into a nervous wreck
","On a Sunday morning in 1999 I made a rare venture to a multiplex cinema, which is 17 or so miles away from my house. I don't usually make a habit of travelling that sort of distance to see a mere film, but I felt that this one in particular was special. I mean, nobody on the face of this planet can fail to have heard of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a low budget independent production which took Hollywood by storm and became the most profitable film of all time. My expectations were high, based on the hype. Then it began...<br/><br/>I remembered hearing that the dizzying camera work could induce nausea, but happily I was not afflicted in this way. The shaky hand-held camera didn't annoy me in the least, and in fact within just a few minutes I was settled into the film, engrossed. As time went on, my nerves began to fray along with those of the guys on screen, and my heart beat faster. By the end of the film I might have well as been a nervous wreck. Because, more than any other film I've seen in my life, this film scared me. Yes, it was creepy and extremely disturbing too, but mainly it was just scary.<br/><br/>Now I've read all the negative comments about the film simply not being scary. I can understand this, because for one to be truly affected by the film then you have to make an effort to engross yourself in the events, to believe that they are real, to not get distracted by the person sitting next to you. It's easy to sit back and laugh, but it's hard to actually get into a film and be there with the characters. Thankfully I did this and I had one of the scariest experiences of my life, an experience which left me scared to go to sleep that night in case I dreamt about it (I didn't, though, thankfully).<br/><br/>The inventive use of the hand-held cameras really makes the viewer feel as if he/she is there in the film. Well, not totally perhaps, but halfway between reality and the celluloid strip. While the film may not be totally original (take, for example, the previous year's THE LAST BROADCAST), in the light of contemporary dull 'post-modern' horror films like SCREAM 2, HALLOWEEN H20 and THE FACULTY, this is a breath of fresh air. I've heard people moan and complain that nothing happens and you don't get to see anything. Well, that's the point...it's left up to your imagination, and I suppose that if you don't have one, then the film just won't scare you. It's the viewer who's lacking, not the film.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly brilliant and realistic. You really get to feel for the actors by the end of the film, and each of the three is a solid, well-drawn person who could be a neighbour. Michael Williams is the most likable of the three, he loses his cool first but then regains it at the end. Joshua Leonard is the most tragic of the three as he sits and cries, and you really feel sorry for his character. Many people have said they didn't like Heather Donahue, but I thought she was amazing. The best bit has to be when she holds the camera up to her face and apologises to the trio's parents. Heather is believable, sympathetic, and her performance really tugs at the heart. The film may have a high level of swearing, but then again I'm sure if I was in that situation I wouldn't mind my language. The trio are simply superb and their acting creates believable characters to sympathise with and understand throughout.<br/><br/>The woods are a perfect setting to conjure up fear (see THE EVIL DEAD and many others) and this film makes full use of them. Behind every tree lurks an unseen menace. I've been in the woods myself at night, and the atmosphere is just right. I don't know if I'll be able to venture into them again in the dark, though. There are also some surprisingly intense moments when the students fight amongst each other, some say that these are funny but they actually brought tears to my eyes...not because I was sad, but just because of the ferocity and violence and because I felt so sorry for the three.<br/><br/>The actual horror elements in the film are outstanding, subtle and all the more effective for it. The piles of stones and stick men hanging in the trees are very disturbing, as is the slime covering the backpack. The worst of all has to be the teeth and things wrapped in the cloth, a moment which is hard to watch. The night time scenes are the most chilling, with the unknown noises and even the - shudder - sound of cackling and a baby crying. So creepy, and so frightening. The bit where the tent is violently attacked from the outside comes out of nowhere, and made me jump out of my seat in terror, it's that horrible. And of course the finale in the ruined house is just totally eerie with the laughing and the jolting, disorientating cameras spinning around in a last desperate rush. The final frames of the film are the most inexplicable and unnatural and leave the viewer pondering events well after the film is over to draw their own conclusions.<br/><br/>As you might just be able to tell, I loved THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT which easily lived up to the hype in my opinion. I'll be sure to buy the video when it comes out. Unmissable, a classic, I can't praise this film enough. The scariest thing I have ever seen!"
"Sabrz","10","2","6","31 May 2009"," The Ultimate Suspense Thriller
","The Blair Witch Project is possibly the best horror movie in terms of suspense. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen as the suspense rarely lets up. It is truly a spectacular horror movie as it will definitely frighten you and at the same time keep you interested.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is about 3 teens who go off into the woods searching for a legendary creature called the Blair Witch which is supposed to haunt the nearby woods. The students never come back. However a year after their disappearance, their footage is found. The movie is the entire footage that the 3 students shot.<br/><br/>There are many elements that make the film so great. The most obvious one is that the students become lost in the woods. Being lost in the woods is bad enough. But when you have unexplained elements plaguing you while you are lost that takes it to a whole new level.<br/><br/>Another element that increases the fear is the many things we do not know. We all have a fear of the unknown and this movie plays into that strongly. So many eerie things happen to the students that they are unable to explain. The fact that we never see the antagonist or the witch adds to the creepy sensation and builds up the fear.<br/><br/>The best element of the movie is the perspective the viewer sees it from. Since the entire movie is from the view of the camera the students carry, the viewer sees and experiences everything from the point of view of the characters. So in a sense we get to go through what the characters do.<br/><br/>Overall the movie keeps up the suspense as viewers never know what to expect. By day we follow the teens as they walk through the woods in an attempt to find civilization. Along the way they find more supernatural elements that challenge their sanity. At night unearthly sounds are heard beyond the light of their campfire.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is not the typical horror movie in that it is all about suspense rather then being pursued by someone. There is no doubt someone or something is stalking the students. But unlike most horror movies this movie is more about agonizing suspense and the unexplained rather then stopping an antagonist or killer. It is that that makes it such a suspenseful and fantastic horror movie. The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror movies and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone regardless of whether you like horror movies or not. No matter your preference the movie will not disappoint you."

OK, sure, the camera is enough to make you projectile vomit in your seat but still, its good. It is undeniable that the first hour or so was good. Pretty freaky stuff, a lot of dark camera scenes. My only criticism with the first hour or so is the constant use of the word 'f*ck'. How is it possible to say 'f*ck' 133 times in the period of 86 minutes? Right, top rant over, we get to the final hurdle. They follow the sound of Josh's voice into a funny house. Was Heather deaf or just stupid? If she found his tongue and teeth wrapped up in a nice little package, why would you follow the supposed sound of his voice? No tongue, no noise. Simple.<br/><br/>After stumbling around a house for a couple of minutes, they explore the attic and the basement where both cameras are dropped. What i fail to understand, however, is why Mike dropped his camera and how the hell they both died. So when Heather drops her camera, we see Mike standing in the corner of the room. What the hell? Nothing wrong with standing in the corner. He may have to come realise that he is, after all, a dunce. How would that kill you? And why would their bodies not be found? Maybe because nobody cared.<br/><br/>Sure, it's easy to criticise and i probably wouldn't have come up with that idea in a million years, but if you're going to act on a good idea...do it well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it was a film with good potential but awful execution."

a wonderful marketing campaign behind it, a chilling ending and great realism, but the film itself isn't that interesting.<br/><br/>Once one starts looking into this this movie, it can really fall apart. One of the biggest flaws in the movie in my opinion is the characters we follow. They, aside from maybe Heather, are all dumb and unlikable, though they're actors give great performances. In my opinion, the film does drag, but the lore, as I said, has more impact than the actual movie. I love the ending, though.<br/><br/>In retrospect, the movie itself isn't great, but it has creepy marketing and lore behind it.

","Celebrated like no other when released, well, before released actually thanks to a then groundbreaking internet and media campaign, it has since become the whipping boy for the entire ""found footage"" genre that followed.<br/><br/>Films, usually awful, cashed in on the success of ""Blair Witch"". Some gems emerged, like ""Utopia Report"", ""Grave Encounters"", and ""The Last Exorcism""; but most were, as stated, awful. Predictable, boring, pointless. And most fan-boy reviewers blame ""The Blair Witch Project"" for these dreadful knock-offs.<br/><br/>None of that applies. Thirty years after it's debut the film is still unnerving. It it plays on your primal fears of the dark, being lost, and being followed by something unknown. That makes the film truly frightening. Not a jump scare to be seen.<br/><br/>My only issue, and one that has been an issue from the first time I saw it, is Mike tossing the map. It would have played better if the map simply vanished. Making Mike the idiot for thinking it pointless and thus tossing it in the creek really wasn't needed to amp up the discord between the three. In fact, he soon was back in good graces as Josh and Heather continued to fight each other. Had the map simply vanished, it could have been attributed to the witch.<br/><br/>While not the very first found footage film it is the best."

","The Blair Witch Project is the film that started the found footage genre and 20 years later, it still holds up as being a dark, intimidating, and great film.<br/><br/>The plot is real simple. Three film students, Josh, Mike, and Heather, are shooting a documentary about a legendary murderer, known as the Blair Witch. They travel through the woods and things go smooth up until they get lost and hear and see frightening things. They must try their hardest to stick together, and find a way out.<br/><br/>I felt like this film was pretty complete. The story was very straightforward and not confusing at all. The acting was good, although their are parts where the characters can be a little annoying in like two instances as they yell and scream at each other. But that didn't hurt the acting or the character's personality in anyway.<br/><br/>I also liked how they did a good job at making the film seem real and makes you wonder if it actually happened. They had a good approach for a specific audience that saw this film and made them concerned.<br/><br/>Overall, The Blair Witch Project is thrilling, dark, and a pretty enjoyable film to watch."
"ashturner-79373","5","1","2","12 March 2019"," Worthy of respect, but not really a good film experience.
","There's something about this film that stops it working for me, and I think it's probably the pacing - let me clarify. I think the performances from Heather Donahue and Joshua Leonard are good (though Mike Williams relies a lot on pantomime stuff like rocking back and forth or laughing manically), and the interviews at the start all feel genuine aside from the fishermen. The premise of recovered footage (à la ""Cannibal Holocaust (1980)) from a student documentary about an urban legend is fine too.<br/><br/>But it's the way the plot unfolds as drama about getting lost in the woods that's the problem. There really isn't much variety in watching people argue about who lost the map, or why Heather is still filming, in between scenes of inane conversation about burgers and getting your shoes wet. It all comes down to people talking in the woods, except half the time it's filler dialogue and the other half it's just swearing and shouting.<br/><br/>I can at least respect it for being one of a few films to really treat the found footage style seriously. The audio seems to be recorded from one microphone, so half the dialogue is inaudible, and the camerawork is often shaky and imprecise. While these can be good ways of conveying that this is genuine, raw footage, they also limit your film, and a savvier FF film would find ways of working in spite of those limitations.<br/><br/>One way this film does at least accomplish that is via its filming style, in which the actors were given cameras and told to basically shoot the film themselves using a vague plot outline. It would've been better, though, if the plot were less padded and there were some variety in the visuals other than leaves, twigs and faces. Attempts at social commentary about Heather using a camera to distance herself from reality don't help.<br/><br/>For a film that's trying to look like real footage, the end product feels distinctly unnatural and messy, almost like it was just improvised by a bunch of people in the woods...<br/><br/>5/10."

","5.6/10 This obviously caught the world by storm when it came out due to its fantastic marketing or trolling however you look at it. People thought this was all real footage and these people actually died at the hands of the Blair Witch. As a kid when this came out, this was truly an innovative film that captivated me with its creepy ominous wood setting and the fact i thought it might have been real. I was constantly searching the woods in hopes of finding things similar to in this film and it gave me great imagination in my exploring. However I had always held an almost angry feeling towards it for not actually ever showing the witch in the film. It led us all in this tense frenzy of psychological terror without ever giving us something to see. If they had just shown something in the final house seen or anything throughout it could've easily been a better film. Ive had a love hate relationship with this for a long time and i do appreciate its forboding and ominous setting and use of the documentary style camera work, but i still feel tricked ultimately by the gimmick and tease of the film. But for what it is it works on some levels, and the folklore and backstory of the blair witch is phenomenally well imagined. The new film as Ive said is superior because we finally get to see a visual portrayal of the witch and it was made with a higher budget allowing them to expand vastly on the plotting and effects. I will say the makers of this film are geniuses with the idea and they grossed a ton from it. Book of shadows was an absolute travesty though that shouldn't be viewed by anyone."

It's true, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) started it all but this flick came out in the beginning of the internet. The Web was something that everybody started to know and this flick was well promoted on that way. Not everybody was comfortable with the web and giving nothing away except the title did the thing. I was in the US when it was promoted and yes, you did believe what you saw.<br/><br/>Cannibal Holocaust surely was a found footage but it was all about cannibalism. And it's there that Holocaust fitted in. The Blair Witch was controversial because love or hate, no in between was possible. Some were afraid seeing it others fell asleep. But it do has a few creep moments especially the night scenes.<br/><br/>Is it all that great, that's the big issue because the only effects used are done with branches and stones.

","Released in the summer of 1999 three weeks after the mockumentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" debuted on TV, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a found-footage film that covers the last days of three amateur filmmakers who wander around the woods of Maryland bickering and cussing.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of found-footage films because they're not entertaining by their very nature. Since these types of movies are supposed to be ""found footage"" they come across as interesting as home movies of family/friends vacations, except that something weird or horrific is taking place. In this case, the three youths are baffled by the evidence of someone (or something) harassing them in the woods, which gets increasingly terrifying. It starts with mysterious piles of rocks and then stick figures; finally someone disappears and they later hear him/her torturously yelling in the distance.<br/><br/>The movie runs 81 minutes and that's just too long for the content. It could've easily been cut in half and would've been more effective for it, but they obviously had to make it ""feature length."" The Maryland woods and Heather Donahue's curvy butt can only maintain your attention for so long. The mockumentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" was a great set-up for this film and it's entertaining for what it is, but it's only like half as long. Watching three people stumble around the forest in home-movie quality footage cussing at each other is just tedious and unentertaining. For me, it's total dullsville; a snorefest. <br/><br/>A good example of a movie that takes the ""Blair Witch"" template and makes a vastly more entertaining movie is 2013's ""Another Kind,"" but that's mainly because it's an actual movie and not ""found footage."" <br/><br/>GRADE: C-"

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","6 October 2015"," A Landmark In Horror Filmmaking And Still The Most Influential Found Footage Film
","Incorrectly labelled by many as the film that launched the found footage subgenre of horror, The Blair Witch Project was a new type of scare for the majority of mainstream audience at its time of release. It was promoted as retrieved footage before its premiere, the fate of the cast was kept secret, and it was filmed in a way most home movies are made, due to which many were easily sold by its gimmick.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project concerns three film students who decide to produce a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. They travel to Maryland forest on a two day hike to find evidence to support the myth but never returned. A year later, their camera was found in the woods with the film in it. The surviving footage was eventually compiled into a movie that captures what really happened to them.<br/><br/>Written, directed & edited by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sánchez, The Blair Witch Project is a cleverly crafted cinema that gets right where most found-footage films go wrong. Here, the reason why its camera is on & around all the time actually makes sense. The story is simple and its the simplicity of it all that makes it interesting. And by not showing any supernatural entity on camera, it allows the viewers' imagination to run wild.<br/><br/>The shooting location & setting add a few elements of its own to the picture. Using the real names of the cast brings more plausibility to what the film claims to be. The camera-work is raw, unrefined, grainy & poorly handled, which ultimately works in its favour. Its 81 minutes of footage raises the tempo quite nicely. And since the cast is responsible for shooting the film & keep the dialogue running in a natural manner, they did a pretty good job at it.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Blair Witch Project may not look as effective today as it did during its time of release but it still ranks amongst the best examples of found footage horror. And what it lacks in conventional horror elements, it makes up with the fear of the unknown that connects its viewers with those trio of characters plus the situation they find themselves in, and that, in my opinion, is its biggest strength. A landmark in horror filmmaking and still the most influential of all found-footage flicks, this faux documentary comes recommended."

"meikemmulder","4","1","2","20 January 2015"," Its only merit is suggestion
","The Blair Witch Project is, according to what I've read, supposed to be a scary movie that plays cleverly on psychological suggestion and I shouldn't watch it alone!<br/><br/>So I did.<br/><br/>First of all, I must say that the acting is rather convincing in terms of 'realness' of the characters; perhaps the 'raw footage' style filming helps in that but purely in terms of acting and the tapes seeming authentic in that regard it's well done. It was a clever combination of acting, seemingly raw footage and improvisation and the actors not knowing IRL how it will all exactly unfold. <br/><br/>The characters are annoying though and especially Heather is the last person you'd want to go on any kind of trip or holiday with. That aside, as the story began I had some hopes due to the reviews about how nerve wrecking it'd eventually become but I found myself waiting all the time for that moment to come. In the movie, the situation gradually starts to get more out of control and the group (which wasn't a winner combination anyway) experiences disputes and distrust almost right from the get-go. However, it gets out of control because of the sheer stupidity of the group, NOT because of the horrors that lurk in the woods. Okay... fine. So there's that. <br/><br/>The nights are supposed to be the moments where your tension really starts to rise. Creepy, weird things happen that gradually increase in severity but nothing completely overly dramatic, I suppose to still give it a sense of 'realism'. The days are used to illustrate how they mess up the situation, how the group is getting more lost every day and how the morale dies a not-so-silent death. In that sense it's a nice dynamic but I didn't find myself dreading nightfall, and the only 'fear' I felt was more close to by proxy annoyance caused by imagining how it must suck to be stuck with these people, being lost in a forest with a decreasing food supply and understanding that the situation in general wasn't fun at all. But... the 'witch' was hardly a part of it! <br/><br/>If well done, certain creepy things, hints or ''how is that possible/where did that come from''s can give you this creeped out gut feeling, the feeling or thought of 'what the hell...!' In the Blair Witch Project there was an attempt to do specifically that but this time it really didn't work for me. Perhaps that's just my (lack of ;) ) taste but I'm the kind of person to be creeped out by suggestion more than the plain monsters yet this didn't really do it. The piles of rocks and the wooden sticks were slightly odd and don't ask me why as I lack the answer, but it somehow wasn't significant enough to give me any hint of ''that's creepy'' or ''wow that's weird''. The daylight parts are to illustrate how the group falls apart and experiences all kinds of stress but it doesn't really build tension for me. There's little mystery and I'm watching the constant arguing, immature behaviour of annoying people who're lost in a forest but there's no increase in 'scare' for me. The nights feel like unrelated intervals. <br/><br/>So we have the combination of getting lost in a big forest, weird sounds and other occurrences in increasing severity in the night, the increasing arguing in a per definition doomed group and eventually a big anti climax. <br/><br/>I get the thing about suggestion and the group losing unity, it supposedly adds to the scare that nobody knows what to do, that they're basically trapped and that everyone's getting really stressed out. Then there're the 'definitely creepy' things like the rock piles. I get it! But it doesn't do it for me. When I dread the thing of 'being lost with these sucky people in a big forest with no food' more than 'being lost and there's the main antagonist of local horror legends playing mind tricks with us' it has missed some marks. Perhaps too heavily dependent on suggestion and thereby going too far/a bit overboard, or maybe it's the lack of actual build of tension other than showing a stressed out, angry group, but it didn't leave me scared. <br/><br/>I'll give some stars for the concept because that could've been great and the acting was convincing."

I was at home sketching Debra Jo Fondren off the cover of Playboy magazine onto a sheet of Newsprint and found I could draw much better thereafter and with more satisfaction and enjoyment. This was a kind of deliverance to me. Idly dropping off the Livernois bus to visit Doctor Curtis' Museum of Black History while unemployed and having time on my hands, I discovered, much to my astonishment, and contrary to what was to be seen on The Science Channel and 'Through The Wormhole', that Black Folks invented as much new technology and made things better for the future as much as anyone else. Besides that, you could trace their accomplishments back through time thousands upon thousands of years.<br/><br/>On top of that, a voice came out of nowhere one day and asked me what my Top Ten Favorite movies of all time were and to list them.

There is no romantic relationship or love triangle between the female lead Heather Donahue or the other male characters. There are no scenes of physical conflict between any of the leads. Therefore, a very interesting question comes to mind.<br/><br/>How could a film made for twentynine thousand dollars plus thirty thousand dollars for promotion costs with no apparent Sex and Violence to embroider its narrative yet go on to gross over a hundred and forty million dollars worldwide? Could it be the focus of the film is on storytelling? This is a great film for Independent Filmmakers to study and treasure. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, according to my lights, is the film that truly and substantially changed the landscape of Cinema. The simplicity of the idea, the method acting techniques used to prepare the actors to improvise their lines and reactions with sophomoric verisimilitude and sincerity in carefully crafted and yet somewhat open ended situations suggests anyone could have made this film.<br/><br/>Even you.<br/><br/>Sure why not? Anyone could pack their gear and cameras for two or three days of hiking to some place nearby like Seneca Creek State Park to investigate the local Bogeyman legend that's supposed to have happened in the woods somewhere out there. Just take a map and mark your destination so that you don't end up off the beaten track or right back where you started and make a careful record of any suspicious items or objects found on your journey. Hopefully, curiosity won't lead you screaming and running through the woods in the dark fleeing from mysterious sounds in the night. God forbid that all the footage you shoot should end up among the found objects involved with The Blair Witch Legend; that you should end up missing and never heard from again.What a bummer, huh? But it really could happen to anyone.<br/><br/>Even you.<br/><br/>Sure, why not?"

","Three film students travel into the woods of Burketsville, Maryland to document the legend of the Blair Witch only to never return, only there footage is discovered.<br/><br/>The film that contributed to and help revitalize the genre for found footage/ first person films. Now in that aspect the film was truly trend-setting. Its story though original failed in many aspects. The film does a decent job in building tension as does its pacing, but for the most part this film only comes off as slightly creepy. A lot of the potential of this film is lost in its three amateur actors who do little but bicker, argue and fight throughout the length of the film. What made this film so immensely popular when it first came out was in its marketing. A lot of film goers at the time felt as though this film was actual true footage, when in turn it was just a low grade horror film. Though a nod has to be given to this film as it did create a new genre within film, that went on to span such films as Cloverfield and Chronicle. All in all for a horror film it misses its mark in some aspects but in others it does very well, which is in its pacing and its tension, but ultimately falls short, mostly in its conclusion, which leaves much to be desired."

","The Blair Witch Project, the film that, more or less, created the Found Footage Horror sub-genre; paving the way for the likes of the Paranormal Activities, the RECs, and Cloverfield. But don't judge it on those (really quite average) movies, because The Blair Witch Project is extraordinarily terrifying. Even writing this now, reminiscing about the film is filling me with fear. It really is that scary.<br/><br/>We join Heather, her friend Josh and Mike (hired because he can work a video camera) as they adventure in to the woods to find out more about the eponymous Blair Witch, aiming to make a cheap documentary type movie on the fairly blurred subject. As you can expect, things soon get creepy...<br/><br/>Genre conventions pop up about the place from the off: unwitting teens, small town-folk, and so on, but it really just works as the characters (keeping their real life names as in Found Footage tradition) bicker and gradually break down from fear.<br/><br/>And there's a lot of darkness. As the kids sit within their tent, in a hope that the creepy noises outside won't get them, we, the audience, are forced to watch a blank screen, just listening to growls outside and the scared banter inside. Just like Paranormal Activity, something the makers of that film quite right jumped on, your eyes dart around this screen, literally looking at nothing, as you wait, petrified, for something to jump out at you.<br/><br/>And that's exactly where the film quite rightly collects its haters. Not full of conventional scares, you're supposed to believe in the characters' fears, their terror of what COULD be out there. You're tasked with believing in the possible evil out there, as opposed to bluntly throwing it at you. Yes, there are bits here and there, visible to us which are horrifying, but the real fear? Our fantastic imagination. <br/><br/>Today, almost 15 years on, The Blair Witch Project may well be devalued by its less scary descendants (avoid Apollo 18 at all costs), and perhaps with repeat viewings it could easily become tame. But if today's Found Footage movies are Blair Witch's children, then TBWP is their far smarter, pitch black and, most importantly, scarier dad.<br/><br/>Watch it with the lights off.<br/><br/>Twitter: @JonnyJonJon1"

","Eduardo Sanchez & Daniel Myrick co-directed this surprisingly effective film that is presented as the realistic ""found footage"" of a documentary made by three college filmmakers Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, & Joshua Leonard(who play themselves) and how they set out to make a film about a local legend called the Blair Witch, who is rumored to haunt the woods in rural Maryland after being left to die by townspeople who feared she was a witch. The students, after done interviewing locals, go into the woods and see some strange things before getting lost, as they literally go in circles with no idea how or why. After hearing sinister sounds at night, one of them goes missing, as tensions flair and hopes are dashed... Surprise hit in 1999 is still an exceptionally well-done horror film, which uses imagination and suggestion to tell its story(except for the rampant profanity!). Creates a genuinely unsettling atmosphere of fear and dread, and the acting is good too, leading to a most stunning end."

Last night I gathered some friends who have never seen this, and let me tell you, we really enjoyed it. As many people have already said, it scares because it doesn't show anything, just leave you imagining all the creepy stuff. All the three main actors are extremely professional in what they're doing, you can't say they're acting-- specially Heather Donahue, whose panic face in the last scenes is phenomenal. As many people also already said, this movie inspired many others, which makes it even better, considering it's huge originality back when released.

They then go on about how anyone who doesn't like TBWD only likes ""excessive gore and over the top blood"".<br/><br/>Something similar happened when the majority of people liked Inception, because it made them feel smart. When in actuality, 75% of those fans wouldn't be able to explain even basic concepts explored in the movie.<br/><br/>The truth is, you can't make a movie where nothing happens, and claim it's good solely for the reason that nothing happened. There simply are no scary scenes, unless you are scared by voices in the woods and an old house. That's really what this movie boils down to.<br/><br/>On top of that, the characters are incredibly unlikeable, resorting to self-sabotage, screaming, and fighting when they should have simply put their minds together.<br/><br/>And finally, the ending is one of the worst endings in movie history, reminiscent of the much more recent ""The Devil Inside"" where we see nothing, learn nothing, and basically the movie feels terribly unfinished."
"MovieGuy109","8","1","2","29 October 2011"," A very good student film better than most horror
","UCF students Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez directed this fine piece of horror on an ultra low budget and did it better than most every horror film around these days. We never see the antagonists but the suspense is gut-wrenching. The filmmakers seem to be playing on something more significant than petty slasher gore but our imaginations and what we think the attackers are, whether they are supernatural or not. These questions that we come up with add to our own personal sense of fear. The thing that baffles me about this film is how expertly the filmmakers understand the personal responses and fears of the viewer and do not tell us what to think about the villains, but allow us to visualize and expand."
"bob_meg","10","1","2","2 July 2011"," ...And if it were released today, people would hate it even more
","How you'll respond to The Blair Witch Project depends on two factors, really. Firstly, if you like your horror movies filled with jump in your seat shocks, tangible glow-in-the-dark monsters, etc...this film is not for you. Also, if you missed it in 1999-2000 as the rock you were under was a tad too cozy, you'll find it to your benefit.<br/><br/>That's because, without overstatement, TBWP is really a publicity stunt wrapped around an urban legend. To say that it's ""of its time"" is a massive understatement, and Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have got to be two of the luckiest punks to ever stagger down a pike --- the movie's marketing campaign, based around the at-the-time newly ""hot"" Internet phenom was packed with more elaborate detail and nuance than was the film.<br/><br/>No, what really sells TBWP and makes it somehow work are the performances of the three principals (Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams). They completely sell their snide cut-ups, bitch-biting arguments, and escalating tension and fear very well, and, believe me, they had very little to work with.<br/><br/>Although the filmmakers do an OK job at constructing creepy tableaux, it's only the reactions of the actors that send it home. There are absolutely NO effects here --- just three young people running for their lives, holding cameras. If they didn't do so good a job, it's doubtful so many people would have been fooled the first time around.<br/><br/>In ten years, audiences have gotten even more ADD-texting-Twittering crazed and the simple atmospherics of creep don't cut it. Personally, I prefer more psychological horror films, and TBWP takes a nicely creepy story (with some truly unsettling details) and realizes it in a nicely chilly, uncomfortably eerie backdrop. <br/><br/>There's a lot to like, if you look."

"ian_bell","6","1","2","30 May 2010"," If you go down to the woods, PLEASE take more than one camera
","After seeing this film way back when it was released I came out of the theatre struck dumb and feeling rather nauseous. Not due to anything horrifying up on the screen - if only there had been - but simply down to the jerky and repetitive camera-work.<br/><br/>Blair Witch is an admirable idea, yet the directors stick too rigidly to their premise. By using one camera they induced seasickness in me, and no doubt a good many other people going by the comments at IMDb. To provoke fear you often have to create a sense of scale and movement - think Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho to name but three. Fear is just as much about open spaces and a sense of isolation as it is about dark corners and close-ups. <br/><br/>Clearly the premise of the film - three film students, missing for five years - demanded certain limits on the storytelling, yet sometimes you have more to play with than you realise. If the story is that compelling, and in fairness the Blair Witch idea was good, no matter what the vengeful critics say, then you wonder how much better this film might have been had suddenly a second camera appeared, tracking the threesome through the woods. Told lucidly enough, the audience would probably not even question it.<br/><br/>Some of the reviewers of this film have been harsh to put it mildly. No, it's not a great horror film, but it is an important one if for no other reason than it shows what can be done with basic equipment and a few thousand dollars.<br/><br/>As I write this review, some ten years or so after seeing Blair Witch for the first time, we are in the middle of a recession, yet what d'you know, James Cameron has just spent $300million making Avatar, some ten years after spending $180million to make Titanic.<br/><br/>Perhaps what's really bugged the film industry, and even some of the audience, is that two young film-makers found a way to dwarf the mega budget releases of Hollywood with a film that made more money than 90% of Hollywood, yet for no more than thirty thousand dollars.<br/><br/>Blair Witch is not great, but it does have something important to say; namely that you don't HAVE to have a $300million budget in order to make a hit film these days. That surely, is reason to be hopeful."
"mnpollio","3","1","2","9 May 2010"," A triumph of marketing genius over substance or style
","More than 10 years after its premiere and many who watch this film may well wonder what in the world the hubbub was about. The truth is that the marketing campaign for the film is a far more interesting topic than anything that appears in the film itself (more on that later). A relatively simple tale of three amateur documentary filmmakers who vanish into the Maryland woods while investigating the title phenomena is the center of this film. The amateur nature of the film-making in that everything we see is fairly badly shot through a jittery hand-held camcorder is supposed to add authenticity and accentuate the ""you are there"" atmosphere of the unknown a la Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Unfortunately, a glaring discrepancy is that Romero's film actually had a solid premise to hang its low-budget authenticity on and the Blair Witch Project has nothing of the kind. The opening moments which introduce us to three characters, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, are dreadfully uninteresting and fail to do much to ingratiate the leads, other than to emphasize that Donahue is a type-A control freak who micromanages the entire foray into the woods badly. If anyone can figure out what the ""legend"" is that is supposed to be so fascinating to inspire a documentary and propel this story forward, they are doing better than I. The mishmash of background provided by snippets of interviews with locals indicate that the legend may or may not have something to do with a witch, a ghost and/or an old male psycho who kidnaps people - the entire explanation is murky at best, which is a fatal flaw since we have no idea what exactly these people are searching for. While there would be some suspense to be mined from easily losing one's way in the wilderness, that quickly dissipates thanks to the ill-tempered characters basically shouting and cursing at other with dialog that is rather painfully made up on the fly. The supernatural elements are total misfires due to two issues: 1) for much of the time, when the characters claim to hear something ominous in the nighttime forest, the audio is so bad that we often cannot hear the same things, and 2) the reactions to the most minor of events are so hysterical as to induce unintentional laughter (ie., someone sees a pile of sticks in the forest, which results in screaming and running). Of the actors, Leonard makes little impact in his limited screen time, Donahue is shrill and annoying, and Williams hints that he might have been able to do something worthwhile within a better structured film. By the end, few if anyone will know what, why, where, how or who The Blair Witch is. It is truly a shame that some of the savvy poured into the marketing did not wend its way into the film. Over-hyped as the little film that came out of no where, such a claim was near laughable since the internet had been abuzz for months before its release laying the ground work for the film and deliberately confusing easily credulous viewers that it was true and what they were seeing was actually a video found abandoned in the woods rather than actors playing a badly written plot. Coupled with a front page Time Magazine article, ready-to-be-duped patrons flocked in droves to see the true story of the poor young victims obliterated by the supernatural, only to subsequently be disappointed in that they were conned and the production they were conned into seeing was a badly filmed, motion sickness inducing, amateurishly acted mess. Don't believe me? Seriously, try to find anyone in the physical world (not in the anonymity of the internet) who will actually admit to having been terrified or even marginally entertained by this film. It takes a really long search. And in the age of similarly filmed efforts like Cloverfield or Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch's fading star gets less notable with each passing year."

","I saw this movie just yesterday. Wow. I had been wanting to see it for a while also. I appreciate the originality on the part of the filmmakers to shoot the movie with crude technology. I found that decision very creative on their part. It makes all of the footage seem real. It is probably the perfect way to film a movie like this, but I must say it kind of bothered me throughout the movie. The Blair Witch Project isn't exactly what you'd call a good horror movie. It lacks some of the qualities a lot of horror movies have, like jump scenes, a villain, and a dark atmosphere. It did have a moderately creepy atmosphere in some scenes, though. The Blair Witch Project is by no means a bad movie; it's just not exactly what you may expect. It's a little different. Most of the movie is centered around frustration and paranoia more than horror. The whole time I was watching the movie, I was waiting for something scary to happen. About 2/3 of the way through, I was thinking, ""Is this all? I thought this movie was supposed to be terrifying?"" The last 5 minutes kind of make up for the rest of it, though. The last few scenes may not be initially creepy like you might expect, but they are after you think about them for a while. Overall, I would say that this movie would be a little disappointing if you really wanted to watch something scary. There is not really anything that antagonizes the main characters except themselves. There isn't really a Blair witch. There are only stories of the Blair witch and encounters with things that may or may not be the Blair witch."

","Okay, so the movie was passable at best, and has not aged as well as say ""The Wizard of Oz,"" but that other movie is filled with happy munchkins and painted horses. THIS movie is dark, creepy, and does NOT have a happy ending (yaay!) To truly understand this movie you really have to step back to 1999 (c.e.) and hear the rumors of ""the Blair Witch"" from friends, the fledgling internet (which has only a few hundred thousand indexed websites anyone really visits, not the billions of pages with youtube and myspace now. In fact, this movie WAS youtube. You see, we all heard the whisperings of some dumb kids who got lost in the forest and got killed. Then the Discovery channel had a special on ""The Blair Witch"" the day before the movie came out. THAT was what cemented the marketing. The problem with the (fake) ""documentary"" was hat it was just a little too transparent. It made you want to believe (like you might want to believe in happy, friendly aliens) but it just seemed a bit cheesy and fake. Then there was the website. It was an ""almost ran"" but the fact that they were selling Blair Witch merchandise BEFORE the movie opened almost killed the entire scam. So you sit down in your seat of a packed movie house and hear the nervous whispers of everyone else asking ""is this real?"" and then the movie starts - a real documentary. The rest is history. Shaky camera work that gives far too many people nausea, the sudden ending that shocks and angers people when hey realize they just got ""punked"" (before there was a ""Punked"" show). This is movie magic at a time when almost all competing movies were [...] formula - and let's not mention television. This movie shocked th public awake and almost - allllmost worked in a BIG way. If they had played their cards a bit closer to their vests and demanded the public believe, instead of hawking merchandise and fake documentaries for a few extra coins, they would have had a PT Barnum worth masterpiece scam on the public. Nonetheless, the movie cost nothing to make, sold for 2 million at Cannes I believe, and made TONS of money in the first two weeks before dropping off the radar and finally becoming a pariah. forget the sequel. The only value the sequel has is to show young filmmakers that YOU TOO can get funding for your second project sight-unseen, if your first project slaps the general public awake. And that is why this movie is priceless. Watching it on DVD you really lose a lot - kinda like watching the Woodtock (1969 - the REAL Woodstock) movie on DVD. If you weren't there, you really missed the whole point - sorry. But it is still a fun way to creep your friends out on a Saturday night."

The movie is about three young documentary makers who venture into the deadly woods in search of a local legend called ""The Blair Witch"". Before the start of the movie, a note appears which asserts to the viewer that the 3 students have disappeared in the woods and after one year, their video footage is received which is the movie itself.<br/><br/>Since the entire movie is like an amateur video footage, it gives us a feel of the friendly videos we sometimes take with our friends with no camera focus, angles, lighting etc. The actors too had to be at their natural best, and they succeed in just playing ""lost"" rather than acting. Hence all expressions of anger, frustration, fear etc look very much real rather than made up. The ending of the movie is like a half-baked cake, it does not fully satisfy the viewer.

","Honestly, at some age many of us are scared of going into the woods. But, for those of us who have been there at night with some preparation, it's really not that scary. The creatures come out to do what evolution and nature have given them the tools to do. In the winter, it's quiet, peaceful, and no senseless screaming. I kept watching and watching expecting someone in this acting group to calm down, look around them, assess their situation, and do something about saving what would have otherwise been a nice little outing. Alas, these bimbos kept whipping themselves into a self induced psychological frenzy; you know, the type that might get people killed. The real torture for me was trying to stay with the film until the end.<br/><br/>That said, I do recognize the elements of film making here that may have appealed to the, supposedly, young audience that fed the hype machine. ""The Blair Witch"" breaks several of the cardinal rules that ran Hollywood motion pictures since the early history of film. Yet, the fact that it hyped its way to a huge profit will be the only footnote listed in the history books. It just doesn't stand up to good storytelling.<br/><br/>Finally, one last observation. I gave this movie a 3 for one reason; I found the documentary about the Blair Witch Legend to be passable. However, for those of us from Tennessee, the parallels and similarity to our ""Bell Witch Legend"" is so obvious it's almost insulting. But, take heart. No one in Hollywood has yet made a passable film of our legend yet.<br/><br/>I read today that the producers have announced they may make a sequel to the film.

There is quite little violence and blood in the film and it's best to say everything in the film is left up to the audience's imagination, which I liked.<br/><br/>This film doesn't need creepy make-up effects for monster.

Thinking that it was based on real events certainly helped many watchers get even more scared than they would normally have been.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job improvising and the crew did a great job at using techniques to get realistic reactions from them. Sure, watching it again nine years later the film loses something without the palpable fright of a movie audience, but it's still a good film.<br/><br/>And to answer the riddle some people who think they are smarter then the rest of us like to pose - there is no ""floating"" camera at the end. Mike had the camera with the DAT, or digital audio, and that's why Heather sounds so far away while screaming in the house. Her camera comes down the stairs and then hits the ground.<br/><br/>On that, still a great ending."

","Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked--to the wildly successful tune of $130 million at the box office upon its initial release (the budget was a mere $40,000). For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their ""found"" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. (As Michael succinctly puts it, ""No redneck is this clever!"") The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history. Even after you take away the monstrous hype, The Blair Witch Project remains a genuine, effective original."

","I seem to be in the minority when it comes to my fondness for ""The Blair Witch Project"". However, it is the pure genius of it that I admire.

Very few films prior had utilized the first-person-shooter aspect and I can think of no other film that successfully delivers the scare factor without any gore or ever showing any villains.<br/><br/>I guess what it comes down to is which Horror camp you're in.

The movie is about three college students who go in the woods to film a documentary about the famed Blair witch who find out there is something wrong with that wood and they find out a little late for a persons liking. The film builds up to the conclusion extremely well and is the first movie that I have ever been so freaked out that I wanted to close my eyes in ( did not though as wanted to see end). Everone who enjoys watching horror movies will watch this movie and be proud that finally a movie can use its low budgetness to its advantage and still be generally scary. Overall the movie is scary and fans of horror movies will have fun being scared out of there shorts. I rate this generally scary movie 63%."
"JetBanana","8","1","2","29 November 2007"," With the right frame of mind, this is a truly horrifying film.
","*Not quite sure if what i wrote about the ending could be considered a spoiler but i thought i should warn you anyways*<br/><br/>I have to be totally honest, I have never really been scared by a movie ever in my life. I was sick of all these cheap horror flicks coming out that just have dark and ""creepy"" atmosphere, but nothing more than a few jumps that really try to scare you. But The Blair Witch Project, although very contemporary, may have been the most frightening movie i have ever seen. I mean this one truly scared me. Granted I'm already kind of afraid of the woods, but the concept and realism of the film really puts a fear into you as if you're living the experience with them. <br/><br/>The key to watching and enjoying this movie is to make sure you're keeping an open mind and taking it for what it is. The film is trying to portray ""footage of three filmmakers who went missing in the woods"" and if you can imagine yourself being the one to find this footage, it can really scare you. <br/><br/>Now keep in mind that this definitely is not your typical movie in the sense that there is no traditional introduction of characters, plot basis, and there is not much of a resolution. Although the ending does leave you with a certain uncertaincy that would not make the end as terrifying as it is if you had seen what they had seen. The sheer mystery surrounding the final moments of the rolling camera are what leaves you with the fear still dwelling inside and the idea of dread they must have felt. <br/><br/>This is a movie that almost demands your participation in the sense that you need to be living the situation with the characters to get the full effect. So please don't sit there waiting to get scared the whole time, because if you're going to sit there and try to take it all in, it's not going to happen. So be attentive and don't expect to be at the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie; the movie is very real to life in that it's like day to day bickering of three filmmakers and their experience with the myth they are pursuing.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"

","The horror genre is one that has long been prone to extremes without much real impact. From the excessive gory schlock of the 70's and 80's to the overused CGI effects of today and even to the new and disturbing ""torture porn"" sub-genre, it is a type of movie that has historically relied on quantity over quality.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project defies every bad clichÃ© of the genre and as such is one of the few genuinely, viscerally frightening films. It relies less on its visuals than on the lack of visuals. The filmmakers understand and tap into the most primal of human fears - that of the unknown.<br/><br/>The film begins by setting up the fictional local folklore of the Blair Witch by 'interviewing' residents of the town. With their stories now in the minds of the characters (and the viewers) the films proceeds into the woods. The sense of isolation is tangible. The film is shot with hand-held cameras, either devoid of color or else in dreary, bleached out colors, adding to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Isolated in the woods, seemingly simple things become terrifying. If you can suspend disbelief you will never be more frightened of a pile of rocks or stick figures hung in trees or strange sounds in the dark. The perspective is often in the first-person, allowing the audience to identify with the characters. Your senses become sharpened with fright as your eyes and ears strain to catch some fleeting glimpse of the ghoul that is haunting those woods.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most profitable movie ever made and is a prime example of what can be done by skilled filmmakers who just keep it simple. 9/10"
"n_unit","Null","1","2","26 November 2006"," A good idea, with some SERIOUS flaws.
","Heather Donahue Josh Leonard Mike Williams<br/><br/>The premise is that three filmmakers went into the woods to make a documentary and disappeared, only to have their equipment found a year later. The film is supposedly their own footage pieced together, a horrifying and true tale of supernatural evil.<br/><br/>This is both the genius and the undoing of the film. The idea is excellent, but the entire experience hinges on the audience being convinced that what they are seeing is real. Unfortunately, the film does a poor job of convincing us. The low budget and inexperience of the filmmakers shows through time and time again.<br/><br/>Often actors will forget or flub lines and have to repeat them (didn't they have a chance to edit this thing?) One particularly embarrassing instance happens during this exchange, about 3/4 of the way through the film:<br/><br/>Heather: What do we do now? Mike: I think we should go into that horse. (pause) Heather: Don't you mean ""house,"" Mike? (Mike looks into the camera doubtfully, turns back to Heather) Mike: Yes. House. Heather:(looking directly into the camera) Can we do that one again?<br/><br/>Other flaws include the very unrealistic ""forest"" (which was actually a huge sound studio in Los Angeles dressed to look like a real woods). At one point Josh leans against a ""tree"" which is obviously made of styrofoam. The tree easily topples over, and all three cast members begin giggling uncontrollably.<br/><br/>Not only did this ruin the tension in the scene, but it contains a plot hole as well: the character of Josh was supposed to be dead by that point in the film.<br/><br/>It's probably worth a rental, but not much more. Look for cameos by Elizabeth Montgomery as the witch, and Bill Paxton as a small pile of rocks. I give it one star."

If you go on you tube or whatever and see some peoples homemade movies about crap, then you can understand what these 3 kids are doing. Just doing it for a little fame.<br/><br/>This film isn't like 1 of those ""Oh- let's- go- and- go- to- that- haunted- house- in- the- middle- of-nowhere- because- its- funny"" horrors. The acting is superb and heather Donahue puts in an amazing performance as she is hopelessly lost as the environments around her start affecting her mind. This is what would happen to anyone lost in a supposedly haunted woods. The mystery factor is all ere in ""TBWP"" as even until the ending, you are still guessing what/why these things have happened. It was only when i was brushing my teeth earlier when i realised why mike was in the corner at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a cracker and it probably in my top 3 horror movies, the acting will blow you away, the mystery will mess with your mind and the intenseness will chill you to your bones.<br/><br/>Happy camping!"
"moviedude-72","7","1","2","11 August 2006"," A petrifying nightmare...
","PLOT: In October of 1994, three film students travel to Maryland to make a film about a local urban legend coined as the Blair Witch, equipped with a camera, tents and very little communication with the outside world. After days in the Maryland woods, things begin to appear outside their tent (i.e. stones and sticks) and strange noises occur during the cold nights. Eventually, they disappear, and a year later their footage is found, pieced together it becomes....The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>During the scariest of The Blair Witch Project moments we see nothing at all; the screen is pitch black. What we hear are the panicked voices of the film crew while outside their tent things go bump in the night. The combination of the distant noises and the raw fear in the voices will throw a chill into anyone's blood. The success of the film is not of blood, gore, nor is it special effects, but of the suggestion that something evil and supernatural occupies the dark shadows in the Maryland woods, and we can easily be terrified of them without ever having to see them. By using hand-held cameras and invigorating impromptu, there is a feeling of real life that accompanies these people on their journey, something sinister.<br/><br/>The directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are genuine and talented. And its even more perfect that they had a tight budget, because the poor camera work makes it all seem like a documentary, like its all real. (no wonder people are still asking questions like ""is this real?"") The cast does a credible job, more or less playing themselves. Heather Donahue is a strong and determine character, and gives the film's most powerful performance (particularly in the film's most intense scene towards the end, which will stick in your mind). However, there's little noticeable difference between Josh and Mike. Both actors manage to make their characters seem like real people...but they are real people we never know anything about.<br/><br/>Overall, the central question of any horror film is: Is the movie scary? With The Blair Witch Project, the answer is undoubtedly, yes! It's certainly a welcome departure from the modern horror film, which have all too often replaced terror with mere gore (not realizing that disgust makes a pitiful substitute for fear). The Blair Witch Project is atmospheric, creepy and very unsettling. It may start off slow (particularly for modern audiences who are use to non stop gore), but the movie becomes more unsettling the longer it goes on, and builds up to one terrifying, devastatingly effective climax.<br/><br/>9.3/10 <br/><br/>See It If You Liked: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980)"

Third time I was a little interested, picking up a few things I hadn't seen. And then the fourth time I fell asleep.

"matlefebvre20","9","1","2","28 July 2006"," It works because it's real
","The horror film market is probably one of the most popular these days in cinema. The main reason is that today's moviegoers and people in general always want to get more and more thrills and experiences that makes adrenaline climbing. Well, you might say that it's not really new, but others things are changing in today's film industry.<br/><br/>I'd say that moviegoers aren't really sensitive to whether the movie is good or not, because they simply want the thrills. That's the reason why ridiculous horror/slasher films are created, such as ""Final Destination"" (and its sequels), ""Child's Play"" (and its sequels), and so on.<br/><br/>However, major exceptions still exist and ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of them. ""Blair Witch"" is far from being an ordinary horror B-movie, or any parody of any genre. It's simply a pseudo-documentary about three film students who want to shoot their own documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, but they inadvertently become the subject of a movie that they never wanted to shoot.<br/><br/>The main reason that ""Blair Witch"" succeeds is because of its terrifying reality. The 'actors' aren't from Hollywood and they always seem to be playing the game during the 70 minutes that we see them. Heather, Josh and Michael are fairly convincing and not only in their scares. Yeah, the scary moments are the main part of the film and it's always great, but the interesting parts don't begin there. Just before they leave to the woods, we clearly see that they're real human beings. They have their own pre-shooting rituals (Heather drinks scotch because she's the director) and they have their own jokes, which do we might admit, are typical of people of their age.<br/><br/>And when they notice that they 'lost' themselves, their reaction, their anger and their frustration don't leave any doubt about their sincerity. It's clearly evident when you see Josh fights Michael, because he let go the map and when Heather angers with Michael while she's taping, causing the image to muddle and shake.<br/><br/>The way that this movie is shot is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of it. It's not in 35mm like in most of today's movies. It's shot alternatively between Hi-8 video and 16mm, which make the scenes even more real. We never see any of the events entirely from an external point of view, because we either switch from one of the students to another. This shooting process makes the movie even scarier and there's no let-down 'till the abrupt final scenes (before it switches to today's footage).<br/><br/>Also a thumbs-up for the sound effects. Sometimes, we don't even see anything (because the camera light is off) and we're still scared, simply because of the sounds we hear. And that's maybe what's the scariest: the sounds. Just hearing the characters crying and shaking, the external cries of unknown people outside the tent and the sounds of the mysterious person who follow them in the night make the viewer shake as well.<br/><br/>Hollywood filmmakers should learn a lesson here. When independent filmmakers shoot a $35,000-budget project that becomes a $150-million hit, there's definitely something to learn. It's not the budget that counts, it's the substance. Just do something that works and the moviegoers will come. And that's what ""Blair Witch"" producers understood. And it's the reason why it became one of the best horror films of the late 20th century. Along with ""The Shining"", ""Blair Witch"" is one of my all-time favorites."

I can't believe somebody really get scared by such a crappy movie. The movie of course has the usual ""true story"" sign, but this time we are brought the story itself as a footage. Yeah, what we see had really happened from what I understood. And the worst thing is that people had believe it 7 years ago and I still read posts about Blair Witch Project being an example of a really scary movie. There are even people who don't find it scary, but they like it. Otherwise, I can't explain that ending, this popularity and its sequel which I haven't seen and I don't intend to do it in this life. And the really really worst of all, is that people had believed it as I said. I guess that if I believed in this, I would have liked it. It is similar to My Little Eye which is a really good horror movie that made me look behind my back. We have stupid teens overacting, camera looking like a home video and some interviews with people convincing the audience and the teens themselves that this curse or whatever it is, really exist. Oh, and we have no themes and songs, cause it is supposed to be happening for real and 5 years later this tape is a movie that is supposed to scare us.<br/><br/>This is basically The Blair Witch Project. I don't like the story, but I would have appreciated the try to be recreated with actors and normal camera with themes. It would have been stupid, but nothing stupid that tries to conquer the genre with its reality. This sucks. I got bored, I nearly fell asleep after 40 boring minutes and then I realized that whatever happens till the end of the movie, I would hate it and the movie I hate could be counted on the fingers of the persons involved with this story. And I can't give 1 to a movie, but The Blair Witch Projects is bad in any single aspect and believe me, I wanted to give it a try after thinking of worse horror movies. It didn't work."

I think Family Guy summed up this movie best when Bryan is a seeing eye dog for a blind man and he narrates ""There in the woods...nothing happens...there still in the woods, a girl is crying...uhm...nothing happens"" I could make an easy fortune narrating this movie for people who can not see very well; I could just say that they're just in the woods and I would have done my job. <br/><br/>Some parts are a bit creepy...if you think that toilet paper roll ups hanging on a tree are the stuff of nightmares that is.

The filming is creative but its just a bad concept<br/><br/>I remember being at the theater, sitting down, and the movie suddenly ends. Credits are rolling and I look around to see if anyone had left; most of the people were so utterly confused, they did not know what was going on. I thought maybe the credits were a trick.

In fact I almost turned it off when an argument scene developed and the language became obscene. However the intensity and realism of the fight, plus the fact that it was acknowledged as being hand-filmed by the actual characters, compelled me to keep watching.

So I consulted the TV guide and read the brief synopsis about 3 students going missing etc.<br/><br/>So what kept me totally hooked into seeing this movie through to the end? The fact that I was honestly unsure whether what I was seeing was fact or fiction.

With this possibility lodged in my mind, the behaviour and demeanour of the characters in the worsening situation seemed utterly realistic and totally unlike any cheesy 'Reality' show.

","I just rented this movie and was blown away. Using what I think was two camcorders, no special effects, no music and an under $50,000 dollar budget, three (probably more as well) filmmakers made a hair raising, wonderfully crafted movie that scares effortlessly without one single, scary scene. The premise starts with 3 students attempting to make a documentary on a local legend-The Blair Witch. They interview the local people living around and eventually go into the forest to search for a cemetery. They eventually get hopelessly lost and we see a wonderfully realistic transformation from hope, to anger, to sadness, to absolute desperacy. The acting is completely unscripted-and to a person who lives in movies where every line has five minutes of thought behind it, might find it a little one note, but if you can forget it's a movie, one will see it's an amazing performance. The characters truly develop and if any of you have been camping for a long time, it will feel very realistic. From bicker to tears everything works well. The premise behind the movie, is that you have to suspend your disbelief and doubts and accept that the everything is real, and further, immerse yourself in the experience and pretend that you are lost in the forest. If you enjoy movies that go to lengths to scare the apathetic viewer, you won't like this movie. It requires empathy and understanding, an once you can accept that, it will blow you away. And if you can, the movie can give a real tense scare and a wild adrenaline rush, without one scary scene."
"jamesnightshade","9","1","2","8 March 2005"," Blair Witch Project is definitely a great horror film
","I watched this film with my girlfriend, on video at home, long after it had come out. We were stunned by the end of the movie, and felt creeping dread in our apartment. We had trouble turning off the lights and sleeping comfortably. The premise of the movie is good enough, an easygoing group of college students investigating local lore, and finding themselves spun into a web of horror in what should be perfectly normal conditions, having fun, shooting an amateur documentary in the outdoors. It's strangely disconcerting that the""witch"" in the movie is never quite seen or explained, and overlaps with a murderer in the small town from many years ago. We aren't completely sure about the source of the psychological terrorism inflicted on the students in the woods. It is at once creepily unreal, witch-like, metaphysical, while also realistic, with links to a psychotic murderer from long ago. The imagery in the movie is justly famous. It begins with a simple pile or rocks, nothing more, but oh so suggestive. The vaguely heard children's laughter and cries as the students' tent is molested is an excellent use of sound in the film. The wooden icons they encounter hanging from the trees as the pressure mounts on them will make your spine tingle. The children's hand prints in the horror-classic dilapidated house in the climax are frightening. I've heard viewers complain that the students confusion and the fact that they find themselves going in circles as they try to find their way out of the woods is unbelievable. I disagree. That type of confusion and inability to find your way out of a terrifying maelstrom is exactly what a ""witch"" would inflict on its victims, exactly what can happen during psychological terror and trauma--like being unable to escape from a terrifying dream. The end of this movie, the heated terror as the surviving students chase a chimera (their captured friend's terrified screams), and their entrapment in the basement (referring back to the tale of the town murderer, told earlier in the film), the final, bleak music after the camera falls, is chilling to the bone. Justly praised. I am pretty sure that true horror aficionados all love this film. I did."

I wonder how much the actors knew about in the final scene though, 'cause the commentary says the actors didn't know they were going to the house and then the crew decks them when they get to the basement - we don't see them on film/video, so we have to assume the actors didn't either. The actors must have really trusted those guys!"

","Blair Witch Project isn't what you usually call ""A Classic"", like The Exorcist. But it's scary as hell. The brilliant concept of filming the whole thing with just a small, blurry camera brings you closer to really experiencing a movie than to any other film in the history of film-making. They weren't trying to do any normal, pretty teen-horror-movie, this is an ugly film, and that's the way horror-films should be. Perfectly accurate camera and some overly-supernatural demon aren't going to get you even close to real horror. You know it can never happen to you. But the Blair Witch Project is very,very realistic. That's what drives a person to the brink of insanity. And the brilliant part is, that they never even show ""the Witch"". The kids just get lost in the woods and then strange things happen to them. There's not a tiny bit of supernatural activity there. Maybe the whole thing's just in their heads. Maybe they're imagining everything. Maybe not. Who knows? And we never find out what happens to them at the very end. All I know is that it's terrifying. It's a raw, psychotic, nerve-breaking film. It's real horror."

","This film is not scary unless you have a good imagination! First of all, I would just like to criticize those certain people who rate this film as pathetic. Most of them probably don't have an imagination and probably fell asleep halfway through the film because they could'not think of the horror that was unfolding in the woods. As I said before this is because they have a very poor imagination. But many people who can imagine things and enjoy this film can picture a terrifying image in their mind of the Blair Witch and what she is doing. And there is also a freaky end scene that made me stay awake for days!<br/><br/>Now let me tell you about the film. It is basically about three students who go around with a camcorder recording everything. They then visit Burktsville and ask the locals about what they have seen or heard about the Blair Witch. If you have a good imagination then you can build up a terrifying image of the Blair Witch in your mind. They then go into the woods and get lost. That is when terrifying events start to unfold and the end scene will leave you looking around every time you hear a bump!<br/><br/>This film deserves an 8/10. It makes you feel like you are with the group as the footage is all shaky and it is a very low budget film( about $30,000. However if you have a bad imagination and cannot picture things in your mind very well then this film is not for you. But if you can picture things in your mind and let yourself imagine what is happening then this film is scarier than any other you will ever see. Oh, and if you really want to petrify yourself watch this film in the dark at midnight when no one else is in your house!"

This is a device that can sometimes be used to build tension, but it flags in places here. At times you don't have a lot of sympathy with the protagonists since they do some really dumb things which make you frustrated.<br/><br/>If you like this sort of thing, then check out The Last Broadcast.

","The Blair Witch Project is not a slasher movie. It is not the next Scream, and therefore will not revolutionise the genre like the aforementioned movie. It is not even the next Alien. What it is a slow-burning chiller that was falsely marketed and thus unleashed onto a mainstream audience whom it never should have been released onto. <br/><br/>Many people class this movie as boring. It is true, there is little ""action"" in at least the first half of the movie. However, this is not meant to bore the audience but merely get under the character's skins. The great thing about the characters in Blair Witch, is that they are gritty, flawed people. They are not glamorous, sometimes not that likeable, like real life. The writers do not make any attempt for you to like them. This emphasises the fact they are real people and respond in a violent manner to an all-too real siuation.<br/><br/>There is practically no gore in this movie. The script is very repetitive- but when does a 20th century young American talk like Macbeth? And the ""acting"" lacks dynamics. But these are what make it unforgettable- ultra-realistic, ultra-menacing nitemare inducing in the extreme. This is true guerilla film-making not for the narrow-minded or those with a short attention span.<br/><br/>Indulge yourself in this unsightly pleasure. You'll thank me for it."

","Just kidding, its hard to believe this movie is only 3 years old...seems like I've been watching it for much longer. Regardless, the film takes place back in the dark ages of 1994, when cell phones weren't as yet handed out to all citizens at birth. I've seen this movie many many times, and it still chills me. Its become the ""Its a Wonderful Life"" of the Halloween season. It expertly exploits the lingering childhood fears of the woods after dark, and the haunted abandoned house. Once again if you keep the supernatural question unanswered, (pay attention Hollywood), it is still possible to scare the fertilizer out of audiences. Film makers are usually just not willing to work that hard. This film has no sex or violence, and only the smallest tiniest dollop of gore. Yet it smokes any movie for fright thats been made in the last 20 years. The performances and writing are brilliantly natural and completely believable, and pose an interesting sociological study on group behavior in crisis. The ""I would have done this"", and ""they are stupid, why didn't they just""...thoughts and debates are what makes the film a masterpiece. Horror films about the woods have been made before, but sadly rarely make use of the woods per se, as the cuplrit of fear. Pity, that fear is deep in our psyche, stamped in our makeup, and if you cleverly storytell, a nut with a hockey mask and chainsaw are hardly required to bring it to the surface."
"bigdaddydave","9","1","2","22 October 2002"," fantastic for those with imaginations
","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>I really cant stand the opinion that this film is ""boring"" or ""not scary"" However, I have a theory on this.<br/><br/>Everyone is familiar with the way films are now so ingrained in the public imagination that ""film conventions"" now provide basis for our reality, as opposed to reality.  Examples including space ship ""explosions"" that would, in fact, be silent implosions.<br/><br/>
The same is true of horror, people think to now be scared you must JUMP and have some tangible monster.  This film completely goes against every corny horror film convention.  It is the anti-horror film (though not a parody)<br/><br/>The genius of the film is that people are scared of walking through woods alone at night, and you don't know why.  So this film relates it to your fears and then places you in the middle, its all consuming, and you definitely feel you are there.<br/><br/>Another criticism is of the ""whiney girl"" and the 2 students arguing. This was probably the most clever aspect.  The fact is people are scared of the unknown, and after the third night visit they know they are going to die, but heather only admits this 5 minutes before the end of the film.  They try to suppress   their emotions (as real people would) and tensions fray. This is also the only film I have ever seen where I could truly believe the actors were tired hungry and scared.<br/><br/>I always argue with my friends about this film, , mainly about the action taken.  ""I would follow the river and run"" Would you?  Run alone through the woods? I wouldn't.  ""i wouldn't go in the house""  so you would leave josh? who is still alive?<br/><br/>To summarise the film is scary genius, its simple tool is making it real to me, and every other imaginative person.  Do you like special effects and crap films? MATRIX! do you like something different, and terrifying? Blair Witch it is.<br/><br/>I could have made this, so could you.  We didn't, I'm glad they did."

","It's a great shame that The Blair Witch Project is probably going to go down in film history as an over-hyped gimmick, endlessly lampooned by all and sundry, and rejected by the horror fraternity.<br/><br/>I couldn't agree less. I loved it. It's very. very rare that a film will affects me physically, but even watching Blair Witch on video was an adrenalin rush for me. There were times when I felt like standing up and cheering. This is audacious movie-making, breaking all the conventions of the genre (and most conventions of any genre) and pulling it all off brilliantly. It seems hard to imagine just a few years down the track, but this was a trailblazer of a movie. I also believe it to one of the very best horror films ever made, and certainly the best in the last 25 years.  Please note, I am not a horror movie buff. And herein lies the rub.<br/><br/>It quickly became apparent to me, after talking to many people who slagged off the film, that their predominant reasons for doing so were that it didn't have any special effects or gore, and that they were somehow offended by its low budget look. In other words, horror is about mindless violence, not psychological suspense. And apparently it isn't about waking up at 3 am the next morning with you heart in your mouth, because you suddenly understood what that last scene actually meant.<br/><br/>Maybe two or three times a decade a film comes along that changes the course of filmaking. In the 90's, the first two which spring to mind for me are Pulp Fiction and Blair Witch. Bravo.<br/><br/>Oh, of course the sequel is absolute rubbish..."

A year after their travel their footage was found, and the movie is their footage put together.<br/><br/>'The Blair Witch Project' is a creepy psychological horror film. Stepping away from hack 'em up slasher movies, Blair Witch is more of a 'what was that noise?!' kind of film. Your imagination plays host a lot of the time.

","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>I have posted to newsgroups and the IMDb a number of times, especially concerning The Blair Witch Project. I have had a ton of response, mostly favorable, to my less than enthusiastic review and commentary of and on this film. The review was based on a screening copy I was able to pick up on the film. The video looked good while the sound left a bit to be desired. Still I felt that my tape was a 'good enough' representation of BWP.<br/><br/>Briefly, I thought the film was a 'nice try' but fell way short of it's own potential, and other than the final ten minutes, was simply not scary. I have to admit that the advance hype played a part in my disappointment but even if I had known nothing about this movie in advance, I would have still felt that it was just an interesting concept but nothing much more than that.<br/><br/>All through this and other newsgroups people have been saying that in order to fully appreciate this movie you need to see it theatrically. So....I did at a huge AMC theater with a packed house.<br/><br/>The presentation itself in a large theater wasn't anything helpful to my original review of the film...if anything it hurt the movie considerably more. Now....the annoying overacting of Heather....was simply more noticeable on a large screen and the sloppy editing was a lot sloppier on the big screen...and the sound wasn't much better.<br/><br/>Overall the acting in this movie is pretty decent but when it IS 'wooden,' boy does that come through on a huge screen! The low budget look of the film doesn't matter one way or another to me...it never did...but the sound DOES.<br/><br/>I believe the sound is essential in a movie that doesn't have any visual efx to speak of, so when our movie-makers are awakened by creepy sounds, we should be able to hear it in such a way as to duplicate their experience! When Heather screams ""it's all around us!"" we should be hearing it 'all around us' in the theater. Artisan should have taken this 'little' home-made movie and added Dolby-Digital efx! (or at lease basic surround) They do it all the time with older mono movies released to DVD....it would have been easy to do it here...and I don't care what anyone says...it would have helped the effectiveness of this film and it would have not taken anything away from the simplistic nature of BWP.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another important point.<br/><br/>I am tired of people defending this rather poorly made movie by suggesting that it's 'rawness' is some kind of important cinematic event or a horror movie 'first.' While I too am tired of overblown efx-laden movies, it has nothing to do with my general dislike for Blair Witch Project."" These people that are criticizing and insulting those that do not appreciate BWP by insinuating that we're just obsessed with and desire huge budgets with lots of efx, are insane! I think that what we wanted out of BWP is something a little better than we ultimately got!<br/><br/>Hell....I just wanted to be a little scared...instead of bored! That's just my opinion...if you found it scary...that's fine....but don't insult and make insinuations about those people that dared to NOT be scared or like this film all that much, as if it would be their DUTY to do so.<br/><br/>The audience I sat with in this large AMC theater mostly laughed at the dialogue and traded comments about 'overracting' and 'i want my money back.' One young woman actually stood up in her seat and yelled ""this sucks!"" when the film ended. Her and her husband left the theater angrily. I didn't see anyone walking out 'excited' about this movie (and I looked hard for that reaction) and I didn't see anyone who looked 'scared' or visibly 'disturbed' (I looked for that too) What I did see were people who were p**sed off because they had been 'duped' by a movie and it's oh-so-clever marketing ploy along with mass enthusiasm from general movie-goers and critics who were 'bowled over' by the film's raw look and documentary feel, as if those traits alone made BWP something truly special in the annals of horror films...something worth 'trumpeting' like it was the greatest or one of the greatest horror movies of all time.<br/><br/>Yes....they felt duped...and they had every right to feel so.<br/><br/>Finally...here's my list of ways to improve this movie, because I truly believe that if Artisan and Haxan would have just slowed down and made some improvements to this film before rushing it into theatrical release, we would ultimately have had a better film, and one that would satisfy most viewers.<br/><br/>1. Add at least twenty minutes of the cut interview footage (Seen on Sci-Fi's ""Curse of the Blair Witch."") and intersperse it between the hand-held p.o.v. stuff that really gets annoying at times. (I mean... c'mon Heather shoots everything and I mean everything!) This is how ""Cannibal Holocaust"" handled a similar idea and it worked much better.<br/><br/>2. Cut some of the yelling and arguing 'about being lost' scenes. I lost sympathy for the characters, especially Heather, when we have to sit through one scream session after another. These were primarily the places in the film where the acting is wooden and one can easily lose patience with the movie.<br/><br/>3. Shorten the time on screen of the discovered creepy things; rocks, things in trees, etc. I feel that went on too long. If you're going to make a movie with the idea that 'less is more,' then it has to be applied to everything, not just the technical quality of the film and the story development.<br/><br/>4. Re-edit the final ten minutes. We go from Heather's somewhat effective 'goodbye' speech directly into the discovery of the house. There needed to be a little rest-stop in-between...a 'build-up' if you will. Perhaps even a non-eventful night, followed by a short quiet day (instilling false hope into the characters and more sympathy for them from us  because we KNOW that this doesn't have a happy ending.  <br/><br/>5. Add a defined surround track...so we experience 'all around us' what the characters on the screen are experiencing during both subtle (normal woods day sounds) and terrifying moments. (screams, kids laughing, crackling, foot-steps, etc.)<br/><br/>6. Any why not at least one element that makes us jump? There were numerous opportunities to do so. I could have seen Heather running madly into the woods and into frame suddenly comes Mike or Josh 'or something else' colliding with her. That would NOT have put this movie into familiar typical horror movie range, it would have added a simple  much needed scare.<br/><br/>(I know I'm probably going to get crucified for that statement)<br/><br/>7. Re-do the end credits that indicate far too much material that we didn't actually see; interviews with family, friends, and law-enforcement, etc. There were some really angry reactions in the theater during this part from those that stayed to watch the credits.<br/><br/>8. Get rid of the dumb cliched 'electronica' that we hear during these credits. Personally I like silently crawling white credits on a black screen and the 'electronica' here only 'cheapens' this movie and goes against it's own style and intent.<br/><br/>9. Quit this dumb rambling suggesting that BWP is real. The marketing people have relied on that to build too much into this insignificant story....and numerous people are falling for it. The average intelligent film-goer should be able to tell in about five minutes that this is just fiction and improvisation.<br/><br/>10. Never allow Heather to do another interview. I saw her on Leno last night and she was obnoxious, silly and did nothing for the credibility of this film.<br/><br/>Those are my ways to improve this movie.<br/><br/>This post is my opinion and I know there are many who will not share my viewpoints, which is fine. I am both frustrated and angered about all the attention BWP is getting. It's success is mostly undeserved. I believe that it's box-office take is due to the money spent by the curious who are reacting to all the hype and not much else. I also believe that BWP's success will be short-lived, profitable yes....but short lived, leaving the film a minor source of curiosity...the movie equivalent to a 'one hit wonder'  Soon...BWP will just be a memory and we all, including me, will move on to something more important. Another horror movie will come along to get us JUSTIFIABLY excited.<br/><br/>God do I look forward to that day.<br/><br/>Thomas Brown Whiz NBC Radio The Advertiser Goes to the Movies"

"LeonardZelig","10","1","2","6 August 1999"," What scares us? This film knows.
","If I asked any horror film connoiseur what the single greatest moment of any horror film is, I would certainly hope the answer would, almost unanimously, be the infamous Shower Scene from ""Psycho,"" by Alfred Hitchcock.  Why bring this up in a review of ""The Blair Witch Project, "" you ask?  Because there is something that Hitchcock understood and is evident in everything he did, especially this particular scene.  What this great genius of cinema understood (and many other filmmakers, such as Wes Craven, have forgotten) is that what is truly frightening on screen is not what is seen by the audience, but what is not seen.<br/><br/>I'd like to personally thank Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for not only making a modern film masterpiece, but for helping movie-goers remember what it's truly like to be scared.  Not just grossed out, mind you, but truly sincerely scared out of our minds.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" has done just that, and has done so with startling originality and what I feel is true genius.  While other films may garner more critical acclaim or Oscar nominations, I know of no other film that is as original or as creative as this masterpiece.  Finally, somebody has remembered what Hitchcock learned, and has made this marvel out of it.<br/><br/>One truly sad thing about ""The Blair Witch Project"" is that it is much too simple and risky for Hollywood.  This film could only have been made independently with first time directors and actors, people who are willing to try anything, and don't know any better.<br/><br/>**** out of ****."

","scary as hell........... thats basically what it is. Yes......it is overhyped and yes.......it wasnt the best movie ever...but it was scary as hell<br/><br/>very few movies has left an impact on me like this one has, i left the theater feeling numb, because this movie movie is different, no cheesy CGI effects, no happy ending, and most importantly of all, not one thing to remind you this it only a movie (except the credits). this is the first movie that has made me think, it didnt unfold totally, it left a big piece missing, and left it up to you to fill it in. the ending was perfect, and for those who said it """"sucked"""" probibly didnt get it. the scary part of the movie was never seen,(something very different from other movies released recently). so please ignor all the hype and what other people are saying about it , and see it.........and even if you end up hating it or loving it or scared the **** because of it, at the very least youll know what everyone else is talking about.<br/><br/>and though people ratethis movie that same way they rate a movie w/a 100million+ budget, it still deserves credit.<br/><br/>so in the end i give this movie a perfect 10 because w/a $60,000 budget, it did a very good job of making you believe it and be scared of hell........."
"CronoBry","9","1","2","6 August 1999"," I'm Impressed
","It takes a lot to impress me. I have been doing local and school theatre for years, so I know what it takes to get into a role. The cast in this movie was excellent. From their actions and words and movements, you felt as if it was happening at that moment and you were right in it. People said it was scary, ""scary movies"" are like Scream and IKWYDLS, because they use sudden actions and loud and flashy effects to scare the audience. This movie was frightening. Frightening is an overall effect that comes from a movie that is consistently and thouroughly depicted to give the audience that feeling inside that that sends a shiver up your spine. I know this movie got mixed reviews, mainly because people went into the theatre telling themselves that this could not scare them. Anyone can make themselves unafraid in a movie, it's the people who go into it thinking that this could very possibly scare them that truly appreciate the film. If you give the movie a chance, you will have pleasent, or rather frightening, experience."

","OK, so the hype has just about driven you insane. You've heard about the Blair Witch enough to make you want to scream... no pun intended. Everyone is talking about it, everywhere you go you see something about it, and now you feel like you are somehow obligated to see it. Well, don't feel like you are being drugged into the situation. It's a hell of a ride, and you won't regret one single second of it.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown of the characters:<br/><br/>Heather is an adventurous female who spawned the entire idea of going into the woods and creating a documentary on the elusive Blair Witch, who has supposedly haunted the Burkittsville woods for over a century. She is the person who films almost the entire movie. Some of the scenes of her are truly terrifying, and make everything seem sooo much more real. I won't tell you about it, but ""The Confession"" scene makes you want to cry along with her! <br/><br/>Mike is, put simply, a baby trapped in a 20 year old's body. All he does the entire length of the movie is complain and cuss, much like Heather. He CONSTANTLY finds a way to get on Heather's nerves. One in particular event(which I won't divulge) will make you want to kill him yourself.<br/><br/>Josh... well... Josh is just Josh. He is pretty much an average dude. He is most definatly a key role in the movie. He always finds a way to make you laugh, but he'll scare you, too. <br/><br/>OK, OK, so people are saying that the movie contains more humour and jibberish than it does shrieks. This movie is most definatly more psychological than it is scary. You have to think about it over and over, and it just gets scarier. The ending is quick and mind-lashing. Secrets are left to be turned up sooner or later... or never? <br/><br/>All there is to say is SEE BLAIR WITCH! It's a movie that cleary you are going to have ONE OR TWO opinions on: It's unbelievably incredible or it totally sucked. Obviously you are going to have to be intelligent and witty to dabble into it's truths. It's a movie that you tend to be more involved with after it's over. Will you be taken in by the Blair Witch?

This kind of raw injection, filmed entirely with handcameras, switching between black and white and color, no soundtrack with the latest hits in popular music, no superhuman leadcharacters, no people with inhumanly good looks etc etc goes against all what the market controlled Hollywood of today stands for.<br/><br/>The backstory of this movie alone raises an eyebrow or two. And the movie itself do not let you down. Three innocent students in the woods, making an innocent documentary. But the subject of the documentary seem to mind, and their terror begin. They have nowhere to go in the woods, evil is all around, and all hope begins to fade. The haunting of the little team is portrayed in an absolutely horrific way, which compared to the trend of the late 90'ies in horror is stunning. The basic idea, which is greatly inspired by Cannibal Holocaust should be mentioned.<br/><br/>The Blairwitch Project will undeniably become a classic in horror, nestling right beside the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria, The Haunting (1963) and Last House on the Left."
"Akashj","1","1","2","6 August 1999"," Awful, MTV-footage non-horror movie
","This is undoubtedly one of the worst horror films I've ever seen.  What is most criminal of all is that all the media hype and my friends were like, ""Oh, it's *SO* scary!""  What a load of crap!<br/><br/>The story centers around three stuck-up kids who decide to film a ""documentary"" about a mythical haunt who lives in the Maryland woods.  This is an excuse to justify 80 minutes of hand-held MTV-ish footage of dark woods and the slowly deteriorating mental state of the characters after they get themselves lost.   They get scared because of odd noises and objects they encounter after they get lost in the woods.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie never actually SHOWS what makes these noises--instead we get stupid myths, a bunch of cursing and screaming from the actors, and a lot of scared and very shaky camera footage.  Even in the amusing final five minutes of the film, where SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS (or at least the pace increases), the film NEVER establishes what is going on!  I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>Only good part of the film: my girlfriend was terrified and held close to me for the entire film.  It was quite romantic."
"Criz","Null","1","2","6 August 1999"," Not Scary, But Definitely Intriguing
","First of all, let me say I did NOT find this film scary. A few kids in the woods jumping around when they hear noises does not send me shrieking to the concession counter for something to calm my nerves. This film is definitely tense, grating and suspenseful, but not scary. The problem is, of course, that the premise is nonsensical. Those of us over 7, who realize witches do not exist outside campus sororities, will not be alarmed at a few tree branches rustling outside a tent.<br/><br/>On the other hand, your girlfriend will probably go bananas watching this film. Five minutes of tension and she'll be clinging to you like you're the last donut at a policeman's ball. (That might not be a bad thing...)<br/><br/>Despite the inherent silliness of the plot, top marks go to Heather Donahue. Not since Pamela Lee's plastic surgeon has anyone done do much with so little. Donahue is an incredibly talented actress, who deserves to win an Oscar for this role (yes, you read right..she's that good) and she would, if the Academy didn't keep dishing out the hardware for drivel like ""Shakespeare in Love.""<br/><br/>In conclusion, do see this film. Ignore the jiggly camera, the bizarre lenswork and the overacting of Heather's male co-stars. Introduce yourself to Miss Donahue. This lady is something special."

"rookie-8","10","1","2","5 August 1999"," Stupid people don't like this movie
","This is not a popular thing to say, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I didn't like Titanic at all, but I am obviously in the minority in my feelings. If you don't like a film that is your perogative and it is what makes this country great. However, having read the reviews on this site I have come to the conclusion that most people who hated this movie really do sound stupid while trying to explain why the film is so bad.<br/><br/>Firstly, if you didn't like this film and you want to put your comments down, please do not start your summary off with "" The only thing scary about Blair is the price of admission"", or the even wittier "" Scary as hell!!!!!! That I paid 8 bucks to see it."" Almost everyone who did not like this movie started off with something of that nature, which was the first indication I had that people who hated this movie are, overall, stupid. If you do find it important to start off with comedy such as this, please also include you address and place of occupation so that I could find you and beat you. It is for your own good.<br/><br/>
Secondly, if you have read anything about this film, ANYTHING AT ALL, you will know it is not a classic ""horror"" film. There are no ghouls or goblins to jump out after you. Jason isn't going to get you out by the Lake house and Freddy isn't going to come for you in dreams. This is a story that is scary because it is REAL!!!!! You can't see what is in the woods, you can't see what is stalking the students because THEY can't see what is stalking them. So many negative reviews have involved comments like ""I kept waiting to see the witch"" or ""how could it be scary when you never see anything."" One person even wrote, while commenting on how ""fake"" she believed the story was, that ""it made no sense for them to be screaming all the time."" If I was caught in the woods, or in my backyard for that matter, with something coming after me, I would scream all the time to. Just another ""stupid"" comment.<br/><br/>But what makes it very apparent to me that those who hated this movie are just not that bright is the fact that everyone who has loved this movie and written about it has talked about imagination. This film is about putting yourself right into the action, right with the characters, at all times. The bickering, the yelling and the screaming, are all things that, in a situation of that nature would actually happen. The day scenes, save for a few discoveries, showed the other side of terror and that was the mental breakdown of all these characters. They gave up hope, they gave up any idea of living through what was happening to them, and that comes across on screen. For those of us who were able to put ourselves in the shoes of Heather, Josh and Mike, that part of the movie was just as frightening as anything else. The night scenes are scary because you cannot see what is out there. The sounds and voices are freaky and make anyone who has ever been in a house alone at night and heard the pipes grumble a bit squirm in their seat. I DIDN'T want to see what was out there because then that would defeat the purpose of the whole movie. It would defeat the purpose of letting the audiences imaginations (those of us who have them) run wild for an hour and a half only to show them the witch, or whatever it was that was stalking the students, right at the end. Its greatness was in allowing for everyone to come away from the movie with a different interpretation of what happened.<br/><br/>Many will assume that this review, or comment more correctly, is the spawn of a stuck up elitest who takes pride in liking something that is not main stream. Nothing could be further from the truth, as most of the time I despise ARTS movies. I like big action, big explosions. Hell, one of my favorite nights during the week is when TNT does their ""Movies for Guys who Like movies"" thing, but this movie to me is a no brainer. (or maybe a brainer, as it seems those who have them love the film) The Exorcist, Alien, The Shining, and many other great horror movies fit into the Blair category. They scare you more with what is not seen than what is seen. They build tension, never letting up until the end, so the audience goes away just as scared as they were sitting in their seats. Movies like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, the seemingly popular horror of today, put in their horror as almost an afterthought. There is no tension built, there is no breaking down of the characters, there is no squirming in seats, only gore and shock and jokes. That might be horror, but it is not GREAT horror, as Blair Witch is. <br/><br/>
Those of you with imagination, go and be scared, be very scared. Those of you who fall into the category of ""nothing happened in this movie, it sucked so bad"", Freddy vs. Jason is in production and should be out next summer."

The movie was worth the price of admission, I think.  By the halfway point, I was trying really hard not to throw up - some of it was due to the motion of the cameras, but most of it was due to the growing sense of dread and anxiety that this movie put into me.  There was not a single scene that made me jump, but the whole movie kept me so on edge that I stayed nauseous.  It gets under your skin - every moment you know that Heather, Josh, and Mike are not going to get out, and worse, you know that they know it too.  I've seen tons of horror movies, and most of them will give you a good fright every once in a while, enough to make your heart pound for about twenty seconds or so.  This movie kept my heart beating hard for a full 45 minutes, at least.  It makes you cold inside, makes you hurt for them, and makes you *never* want to be in the woods ever again.

"ECoyote","Null","1","2","5 August 1999"," Utterly realistic, heart-stopping, and frightfully compelling...one of the best films of the year! One of the truly best horror films ever made!
","It's hard to describe how I felt after exiting the theater doors that housed the utter brilliance that is ""The Blair Witch Project."" As I moved throughout the large crowd (an unprecedented amount of people for the ""art house"" theater that I saw it at) to the lobby exit doors, I watched other people in the lobby with a suspicious anxiety and a slight ""clamped"" feeling within my chest. These emotions were a direct response to my Tuesday night at the movies.<br/><br/>I came out of this film, feeling a deep dread and sorrow for these people, even though this incident didn't even actually occur. That's how compellingly realistic this film is. It's so realistic that you will swear, once you exit the theater, that you could find an article about it in an old newspaper from 5 years or something (**SPOILER: The incident is supposed to take place around October 1994 **). <br/><br/>
Here's my overall view on ""The Blair Witch Project."" ( NOTE: From what I've read [as I am a film major], the writer/director team of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez wrote a general plot outline for the three main actors they hired and instructed them to improvise dialogue while encountering different locales that had been set up by Myrick and Sanchez. So, in a way, it's not clear who is exactly responsible for certain technical aspects of the film ).<br/><br/>CAST: The list of actors in this film includes extras who play town people being interviewed by the three main actors, played by Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, and Joshua Leonard. This trio of actors are complete unknowns and I've never seen them before, but expect Hollywood to react to them in a big way. They are incredibly talented, especially Donahue, and their improvisational skills are top-notch. I thought I was seeing real students making a real documentary film. Donahue, in particular, is fantastic as she grows more and more frightened and bears the load of being (**SPOLIER**) the ""team leader"" (so to speak) and being the only woman out in the woods with these two guys.<br/><br/>MUSIC: (**SPOILER**) While there's no music within the film (at least not a score), there is a disturbingly simple and eerie bit of instrumental (I guess it's instrumental...?) that plays over the end credits. Kudos to Tony Cora.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: (**SPOILER**) While most of the film was shot with a 8mm color camcorder and a 16mm black-and-white camera (I assume those are both correct), the effect of switching back and forth from these two devices is haunting. Because of the limited focus and technical abilities of both of these camera types, you begin to feel more and more dread for what's lurking around the next tree, shrub, or bush. In addition, the matte lines (**SPOILER**) used to crop the image into the center of the projection screen create a realistic look for the type of cameras used. They also emulate a kind of restricted space for these characters to be roaming around in, even though they are wandering through a vast expanse of woods. You actually feel like they're trapped...with nowhere to go.<br/><br/>EDITING: This film feels like an actual documentary. You believe this is real and that it did indeed happen 5 years ago. That is due largely in part to the way it's edited. The various jumps from one shot of them shooting their ""actual"" project footage to shots of them just goofing off or having a conversation is an example.<br/><br/>WRITING: The story and plot is scary and frightening as hell. Even though it harkens back to the stories of witches and the banishment of them, such as was reported in Salem, the most powerful aspect of this film comes from its masterful technique and the way it was approached in its making.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: Again, I can't say who's exactly responsible for the directing, even though Myrick and Sanchez are credited for it. They didn't actually supervise the camera work or remain present at every moment (at least as far as I know). Still, their ultimate approach to filming their story with just an outline and improvisational actors is incredibly brilliant and will most likely spawn a number of copycats in the horror genre(i.e. ""Scream,"" ""Halloween"").<br/><br/>In closing, this is a film I will never forget. I always be reminded of it when I go hiking or camping anywhere. I always be reminded of it when I look out the window at the woods that permeate the area around my house. And I'll always remember (**SPOILER**) that last intense, frightening image.<br/><br/>Easily the best film of the year (up there with ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and one of the best horror films ever made.<br/><br/>**** out of **** stars."

","I'm not the kind to just write haphazard reviews just so people can see my wonderful opinion online. I have to really believe in the film to get myself to write about it. Remember the movie ""Crazy People"" with Dudley Moore? It was a comedy about truth in advertising. There was a film in that film called ""The Scream"" which had the tag line ""This movie won't just scare you. It will F**k you up for life"". That line shoulda been used for this film. This is THE REAL THING. It's the most well structured, incredibly well executed film I've seen in years (hell, maybe ever). After a title card explaining what we are about to witness, the entire film is made up of ""Raw"" camera footage from both a 16mm movie camera and a hi-8 video camera discovered a year after the events on the media. The footage relates the story of 3 student filmmakers hiking through the woods of Maryland, seeking out sites of gruesome mutilations by a mythical Blair Witch. Things go bad, then worse and then indescribably horrible as they lose their way deeper into the woods all the while being stalked by something that may or may not be human.<br/><br/>The actors are first rate. It's not easy to describe the ease which the actors pull the audience in with their performances. On one hand, I'd like to see these performers move on to deserved better things, but at the same time, I'd like never to see them in another film... just to bolster the illusion of this film.<br/><br/>There is not a drop of blood spilled, nor is there any background music to be heard. That's right. NO MUSIC! This film is the only one I can recall that can scare without the use of musical Stings or excessive bloodletting. That in itself is an achievement. Sound effects carry a lot of the tension and fear, but it's what the movie DOESN'T visually show that is the most terrifying.<br/><br/>This film won't be for everyone. The narrative and camera style might throw people off. The fact that this isn't a film you can dismiss with a laugh might throw others off. Let them stick with their ultra hip ""Scary Movies"" (I loathe that term). This is THE REAL THING."
"BeTheBuddhaProds","10","1","2","1 July 1999"," I'm never going camping again!
","Theatres should dispense Sominex with the purchase of every ticket to the upcoming summer release, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. After viewing the film, a good night's rest was a hard time coming. That, and I'm never going camping again. I imagine the camping business will take a turn for the worse after July 16th, when the film is released in theatres.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why BWP was a Sundance favorite and even the winner of the audience award at Cannes.<br/><br/>What makes the movie is the final scene where legend meets reality. Without giving anything away, Sanchez and Myrick tied the entire story together with a single camera shot. With that single shot, the filmmakers were able to frighten the most heroic of men, the most grounded of horror fans.<br/><br/>A must see for any fan of the horror genre, it is also a must see for any fan of a good story."

","""Tense,"" not ""scary"" is a more truthful description.  I liked that it wasn't a slasher and had almost nothing grotesque.  The movie lacked good dialogue but it did keep me interested.  Don't expect your heart rate to go up until the last 15 minutes.  IF YOU GO, SEE A MATINEE."
"nicbby","7","1","2","4 August 1999"," incredibly unnerving at times
","If your looking for something new at theaters, The Blair Witch Project is the ticket. The movie actually gives you very little information, only bits and pieces of a legend, but its what they don't say that makes your imagine what could of happened to these three young people while lost in the woods. Some might tire of the way the film is shot, by using two hand held video camera.  After awhile the constant motion of the filming made me feel sick and I had to look away from the screen. (especially during the running scenes).  However, this was an incredibly entertaining movie.  The last scene will leave you with a cold chill and will not be easily forgotten.  It just proves that there is some originality left in Hollywood, I hope to see more."
"Colonel-6","10","1","2","30 June 1999"," An Amazing Scare!
","This movie is the scariest movie I have ever seen.  It is brilliantly written, directed, and acted.  The concept is unique and ingenious. Instead of seeing the movie from an outside, third person perspective, we get a first hand look at the footage filmed by the characters themselves.  This effectively puts us in the woods with them.  You don't just watch this movie, you experience it.  You see what the characters see; and you fear what they fear. The trailers for the film and the webpage built my expectations up very high and the movie itself did not let me down.  The tension created by the film was intense, and everyone who attended the screening I saw walked out with looks of shock and exhaustion on their faces.  We all looked as though we had been through some great ordeal together. If you get a chance (and you want to be scared) go see this film!  It's worth it!"
"zoofus","10","1","2","4 August 1999"," If only ...
","If only the ruse could have been kept up a little longer. If you haven't yet seen this film or heard anything about it (yeah, like that's possible), stop reading immediately and go see it. This was a great idea with amazing execution, and if I hadn't been told (by some idiot who will pay) that it's not a true story, I would say that it's the scariest film I've ever seen. Even with that knowledge, it was close.<br/><br/>I tried very hard to avoid all the preceding hype, and was almost successful, having seen no more than a print ad with the now-famous come-on (see above). The pains that were taken to make this amazing film seem real, along with the flawless performances by the actors, sucked me in like nothing else I have experienced. In a perfect world, everyone would see this movie the way its creators intended, with none of us knowing that it wasn't found footage. As I said, I had already been told, and I still spent the entire second half squirming with fear.<br/><br/>If you're looking for one of the gore-flicks that pass for horror films these days, this ain't it. But if you want a unique cinematic experience that is nothing short of harrowing, see this movie. It's just too bad they couldn't keep the secret."

"dvdbn","7","1","2","30 June 1999"," A must see for anyone who wants to be scared
","This movie is not for everyone. Young children shouldn't be seeing this movie, and probably no one under the age of 14 or 15. It's VERY intense. There's a great deal of profanity. The movie is so true to reality that it's impossible to distinguish that it's really only a movie (or is it? you decide). The movie has no blood or gore (except for a very small bit of blood that totals no more than 30 seconds of camera time) and no music to lead you to fear - instead, it relies purely on psychological terror and one of humankind's biggest fears - being hunted. My suggestion if you're going to see this movie when it premiers - park your car in a dark, isolated spot. As you're struggling to get back to your car, you'll realize how scary a movie can really be. This movie is no less than excellent. It's put together well and it's unlike any horror movie ever made. Learn as little about it as possible before you go see it, as it will greatly enhance the experience."

","I knew nothing of this film going into it save for what I had read on the posters.  Luckily, I was extremely impressed but also extremely spooked by it.<br/><br/>It wasn't meant to scare but to terrify.  The true embodiment of fear comes from within when the imagination is left to run wild as it does in the 3 characters of the film.  It wasn't meant to make you scream, it wasn't meant to make you jump, it was meant to make you think and use your imagination. Your imagination is more powerful than any cinematic effect that they could have possibly used.<br/><br/>Other reviews said this film was a disappointment, they were waiting for the final punch.  I was more disappointed with The Haunting (yes, I did see it). I liked this film a lot and impressed with the fact that for something as low budget as this is, it can still do as well as it has.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and go see this film."

","Let me pose a question. What is more fearful? A noise in the dark or the thing that actually makes the noise? Usually the noise alone. I'm not too scared when i'm in my downstairs and i found out that the noise was really just one of my two birds munching some birdseed.<br/><br/>This movie really digs deep into fear.  Most movies nowadays can't seem to scare the audience without shock music and 3000 gallons of fake blood.  This movie far surpasses others in the scaring department even though it has aprroxamtely 1/1000 the budget.  <br/><br/>I watched this movie two days ago and the final scene still gives me chills. This movie though is definately not for the MTV generation of people who need an explosion or bloody corpse every minute(hey i'm saying that and i'm a teenager)<br/><br/>The only real flaw in this movie is that we cannot really beleive that they would continue to film with all the paranoia in their minds by the end of the film.  This movie though really builds and the fear is not attained by jumping out of your seats. It's the sense of dread when you come home and wonder what that bump in the night was..."

This film was refreshing in its originality, an example being the camera shots, as well as the fact that the players are also filming it. That offered a more terrifying perspective. Since this film is fairly unseen, to date, I will not reveal plot, etc.. it's also nice to see that the directors appear to be down to earth people. I don't think this film would be as lively had it been any other way. Bravo."

Period.  The acting is brilliant.  I never got the sense the 3 were actors speaking lines - I felt they were three armature film students lost in the woods being hunted.  The fear in this film isn't from Â‘special' effects but from my imagination. Mostly sound and fury signifying everything."

","I'm not a huge fan of bloody horror films, but I love to be scared as much as anyone.  Due to the prerelease hype I was really looking forward to this movie.  Sadly, I found this film more boring than scary.  The endless arguing and trudging through the woods got old really fast.  If you've ever had to sit through the projects of some untalented film students you'll find these scenes true to form.  For me, there was no tension building.  The fact that the clueless group was lost in the woods had me worrying more than any supernatural events.<br/><br/>This movie is a great example of average filmmaking and excellent low budget marketing.  It's good enough to rent, but not to spend $8 on."

The whole movie gives you an eerie feeling that what you are watching is real; that you are right there with them in the woods.  Then, as their situation gets worse and worse you are sucked down with them.  The last five minutes of this movie are incredibly haunting.  Of course words cannot describe just how creepy the entire thing is: It must be seen to be believed."

","Not far from my house growing up we had many ""Indian Burial Ground"" rock piles and foundations from Colonial times. My friends and I used to scare each other telling stories of witches. One day while walking in the woods among some old foundations, my two friends and I superstitiously stuck leaves on the ends of sticks stating that we were safe from witches as long as the leaves remained on our sticks. No wind came but all three leaves fell at once. My dog spooked ran back towards home with us close behind screaming... Twenty years later... I felt like doing the same at the movie theater.<br/><br/>Never has anything been so realistically portrayed where I have to keep reminding myself that it wasn't real.

My girlfriend sitting next to me said that she closed her eyes during the frightening scenes- I told her that she didn't miss anything- It's not what you see in this movie, it's what you hear.

What the hell is that?"" Most horror films try to effect you with various gothic lighting schemes, or all sorts of hyperbolic visual effects. Poopoo. This film lets you imagine what you're seeing without making it seem like a trick. The most powerful thing about this movie was effect of the ending- you're really left with a feeling at the end of having to figure it out for yourself (which I can't explain without giving away the ending).

","After the barrage of awful ""Scream"" clones that Hollywood has been force-feeding the public for the past several years, two unknown filmmakers have brought us a film that should show people what makes a truly effective horror film.<br/><br/>The acting from the three stars was in fine form and the ad-libbed dialogue was really impressive. It was totally convincing and never seemed fake or contrieved. It was interesting and rather unnerving seeing the them start out as cocky and full of gusto (especially Heather) and go on a slow, gradual emotional and psychological decline. How they gradually started getting more ditraught about their predicament and started turning on each other. Their ""discoveries"" in the woods and the sounds in the distance was creepy for the audience as well as the characters.<br/><br/>I was rather impressed at how they didn't use background music to cue the audience in on when to feel unnerved. The movie relied solely on the environment and the reactions of the characters to set the mood. I used to think that a movie with no music would never work but it looks like I was wrong.<br/><br/>The last ten minutes of the movie were especially creepy. I could actually feel my heart racing. And the ending blew me, and the rest of the audience, away.<br/><br/>It's nice to finally see someone make a horror movie the way it should be done. No cheap ""jump"" shots.

","I am a horror movie buff. Nothing scared me, until now. I just got back from see The Blair Witch Project just a few hours ago and I am still too scared to sleep. This movie was just too real. I don't even like calling it a movie. The only thing that made it a movie is that you had to pay to see it on a screen. It's the documentation of four terrifying days that these 3 students had to endure before disappearing forever. I honestly don't even know what to say. I'm still shaky from watching it. I think those who don't find this movie frightening are either really sick people or just didn't understand it. I know many didn't understand the ending, but just think of what one of the legends that the townspeople mentioned and perhaps you'll make the connection. I could go on forever, but I won't. Yes, I'm glad I saw this movie, don't get me wrong. But, like I said, it was too real. I felt as though I was with them which made it all the more horrifying.

"Grifter84","10","1","2","24 June 1999"," Most frightening concept ever
","Since I was a little boy (not so long ago, now that I think about it), I have always been afraid of being in the woods at night and this movie has managed to squashed any chance of me ever overcoming that phobia. It has accomplished the amazing feat of conveying the terrible essence of one of humanity's basest, most primitive and most overwhelming emotions: pure unadulterated terror. The makers of this film understand perfectly that what we can't see is a thousand times more petrifying than what we see acted out in front of us. While we may be a bit shocked by a shot of Jason slashing up a girl at a summer camp, it is only the fear of the unknown that can truly terrify a man. The human imagination will always be able to think of something more frightening than what can ever be shown on a movie screen, no matter how much gore is piled on. Give credit to the writer and director who have created what is undoubtedly one of the most original films of the decade, and most likely the scariest film that anyone will ever want to tremble through.<br/><br/>I beg of you, do not see this movie unprepared. DO NOT BRING YOUNG CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON GOING ON A CAMPING TRIP! I cannot emphasise enough that I am still having nightmares from this movie. Watch at you own risk."

","The Blair Witch Project is the scariest movie I've seen in long time, if not ever. As an adult, growing up with horror films by Carpenter and Craven, it now takes quite a film to even bring a shiver anymore. The first ten minutes of Scream looked to fill that void until it devolved into a mimic deconstruction of the horror genre. But Blair Witch takes you on a realistic, psychological journey into a terrifying myth and keeps you hooked (and scared) for 90 minutes. The last 30 minutes creep by as the overall sense of dread turns into living, breathing, palpable fear, both on screen and in the audience. A fantastic film that deserves a large following outside of the cult/college/festival circuit."
"shecky-2","10","1","2","2 August 1999"," Funny, Innovative, and Damn Scary
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>What's scarier than Freddy, Jason, and Michael Meyers?  What you can't see. The dark.  The noises in the dark.  The unexplained.<br/><br/>This is the concept behind the Blair Witch Project.  I won't say much on the film, just a few notes, because it is the first film I've ever seen that one must experience for oneself before one can truly enjoy it.<br/><br/>You never see the monster.  You never see death.  All you see is dark.  All you hear are things that go bump in the night.  The scariest moment of the entire film, the moment that really sent a chill down my spine, is seeing Mikey standing in the corner of the basement, as you see the last few seconds of Heather's videotape.  Before it drops.<br/><br/>But we don't see the monster.<br/><br/>Not only does this prove an excellent effect, but the way in which the entire film was made.  All improv.  The actors never told what was going to happen.  Filming it themselves.  This is the reason the film REALLY works. We can feel the insanity the lost students go through.  We can relate to them when they scream at each other.  And, it's funny because it's the same way we would react.  The funniest moment of the film is when the brightest ray of light in the four days lost kids house is when they find a pack of cigarettes.  And, as a member of the audience, you feel the little bit of joy they have.<br/><br/>That is all that can be said.  Live it for yourself.  Feel it's fear."

","Its trailer was vague, its plot was strange, and its characters were unheard of.  After hearing much gossip and reading several reviews, ""The Blair Witch Project"" seemed more and more intriguing to me.  I had to go out-of-town to see the film so I was very ready to see it.  When the movie came on...not a single credit...not a single note of music.  Just the title.  As the movie went on, the arguing and constant bickering did get a bit annoying.  But a single event caused the arguing to stop (I won't give it away to those who haven't seen it).  But, best of all, the end of the movie.  The conclusion of the movie truly scared me silly.  The confusion that occurs in the end, the madness in their minds...it amazed me.  The ending BLEW ME AWAY.  It was excellent.  So, all of you who haven't seen it yet, pay close attention, and prepare yourself for a brilliantly horrifying end."

","What makes The Blair Witch Project such a uniquely terrifying movie has more to do with the concept than the execution.  The mainstream horror films rely on surprise to maintain suspense.  In fact, moviegoers are usually conditioned to sit on the edge of their seats, waiting for whatever may burst onto the screen.  I spent sixty non-stop seat-gripping minutes of this film waiting for just such a shock -- non-stop precisely because the moment never came, leaving me with the much more suspenseful feeling that it was still to come."

It wasn't until this afternoon that I had an answer, I didn't like this film.  I LOVED IT.  There was so much to it - we saw it as a bad-camp video [you know what they are like] and we saw the characters as just that - real people as opposed to actors following a carefully monitered script.  We saw real emotions and all of the people involved in the production need to be commended greatly.  Not only is this the best horror/suspence film of our time it measures up as one of THEE best films in general.  All of the horror that this movie had to offer was the build-up and your after-thoughts.  The conclusion is perfect - see this movie as soon as you can.  It is amazing.  We should be seeing the name Blair Witch at the Oscars this year."

","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>It seems to me that horror films have evolved over the past 20 years to the point where the writers are forced to rely on pretty superstars running from a masked villain and directors are required to have buckets upon buckets of fake blood and intestines on standby.<br/><br/>All in favour of a change, raise your hands.<br/><br/>I thought so.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is an oasis in a desert of pathetic, half-thought out chop-slop flicks and is destined to stand out among such greats as dePalma's ""Carrie"" and Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"".  The reason I say this is simple:  Nothing like this has been done within recent memory.  The concept itself is so unique that the directors very well could have let the concept ""coast"" the film along, but instead they chose to make it a character study and it paid off.<br/><br/>What really made this film great was the sense of impending doom that slowly crushes the spirits of the three characters.  Several scenes in the film such as the scene in the abandoned house and the discovery of a certain item hidden within a bundle of twigs are sure to go down in cinematic history.<br/><br/>My only problem with ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the ending, which seemed to be rather ""tacked on"" and personally speaking not all that scary. However, the rest of the film does not pale because of it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting the bejesus scared out of them.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Nathan Taylor"

The fear of the unknown source of the noise chills your blood. That fear of the unknown is what makes The Blair Witch Project one of the greatest horror films.<br/><br/>Only using a camcorder and a black and white 16mm held by the actors themselves, the film's subjective cinemtography heightens the atmosphere of fear. Many scenes at night nothing is visible but darkness. The soundtrack is filled with noises but the camera keeps jerking around; you can not find its source.The scene inside the house ( I won't say what happens there ) was filmed ingeniusly (if done on purpose). One character holds the camcorder, the only piece of equipment capable of recording sound, while the other has the 16mm which has no sound recording device. As the one with the camcorder runs down the stairs, the audience can only see what the 16mm sees as it is trying to follow the other person. The screams of the person with the 16mm can only be heard as distant screams through the camcorder's microphone. So the descent down the stairs has an eiry detachment that works extremely well.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project shows that multi-million dollar budgets are not neccesary to make high quality films..."

","This movie presents itself as a great book, exposing the psychological turmoil of three student film makers lost deep in the forests surrounding Burkittsville Maryland and hunted by an unseen evil presence.  Stylistically the film views as an ameteur video shot through a home video camera which adds to the realistic suspense present in the film maker's lost footage. Unfortunately, the style of the film will undoubtedly lend itself to negative criticism from viewers entrenched in the superficiality of the high priced - low substance modern american film.  It is a movie that requires the ablility to think independently by using one's own imagination and perceptions.  The Blair Witch Project is a must see."

The mind will always surpass what can be shown on the screen, the less that is spelled out for us in fake blood, the more our minds fill in with our own twisted personalised psyches. To further engage the audience, the entire movie is made from the only remains of the victims, the film in their camera that was found a year after their disappearance.  In the noir tradition, we know that they're doomed and we're going with them, to our deaths, living out a campfire story, helpless."

","Those who think that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not truly horrific have not given the film enough thought. The movie is not scary by conventional terms, but builds its horror and suspense on a more psychological level. The final shot of the movie, while a tad ambigous and question-raising, is there for a reason. Viewers who are thoughtful and attentive enough will make the connection between that final chilling shot and a line of dialogue that is stated near the beginning of the film. Once I made the connection between these two crucial points (which was about an hour after I'd seen the film), I was chilled to the bone. Sleeping was nearly impossible the night I saw the film, and I must now honestly say I've never seen a movie as bleakly horrific as ""The Blair Wit"

","Without compare, this low-budget thriller is in a close run with THE EXORCIST in my ""scariest movies of all time,"" and the only reason it doesn't beat out THE EXORCIST is because imo it's not as ""real"" and disturbing spiritually.  It is, however, a terrifying experience which I think is sure to set a new precedent for Hollywood scare-fests (or atleast I hope so).<br/><br/>Simply, most of what happens with TBWP doesn't happen on the screen at all. I hate to burst your bubble, but if you go to this flick expecting to see some mean and evil looking ""witch,"" forget it.  The movie has barely anything to do with witches in the typical Hollywood sense of the word (nevermind the real sense of the word).  Neither will you find teenagers being axed to death during or after having sex, scantily clad cheerleaders fending off chainsaw welding maniacs wearing pig heads, psychotic transvestites with machetes bent on hacking apart those who jilted them, buckets of blood, HP Lovecraftian creatures lurking in shadows and beneath damp graveyards or any of the other stuff your USED to seeing on the silver screen these days being billed as ""horror.""  What you will discover is yourself immersed in the experience of the movie, like a cinematic funhouse where most of the horror is supplies by your imagination spurred by slight visual and mostly aural screen cues.  <br/><br/>For the most part, not much happens on the screen... but the suggestion that there's something exceptionally horrific and inherently diabolical will ignite your imagination to fill in the blanks with a host of horrors individually suited for each theatergoer.  Now those are some noteworthy special effects!<br/><br/>I won't give away any of the plot.  I won't tell you what finally happens at the end (?) of the film, suffice to say that I sat there with my jaw open staring at the screen in near shock.  And something else happened in the nearly 3/4 full theater which hasn't happened in a long time (and I'm a pretty regular theatergoer)... the audience was DEAD SILENT.  I could hear the breaths of those around me, sharp intakes, gasps, heart-pounding heavy inhales... this movie gripped the audience and held it quiet and interested.  There were some minor scenes where the tension was allowed to vent a bit, but for the most part it was a slow boil toward a crescendo which was unlike most any other movie I could mention to compare.<br/><br/>This film is innovative by design.  Everything from the actors to the presentation to the marketing was a refreshing wind to this summer's movie calender.  It's ironic that perhaps the lowest budget film I've seen thus far this summer is perhaps the best.  It is perhaps best successful because it really does draw the viewer into the picture like the best campfire ghost story.<br/><br/>FOUR STARS, no disappointment, this film lives up to the hype.

","I'm writing this from alone in the office at 10:00, there is no one else around, and this building is rumored to be haunted.  I should not have watched the Blair Witch Project last night. This is the first film that has scared me as an adult.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the most elegant horror movie ever.  There is no omniscient camera to interpret events.  It does an excellent job of making you feel like your really in the film and not just observing the characters.  Sure, lots of movies place the viewer as first person, but usually for only a few shots intended to give us a jolt.<br/><br/>The timing in the use of props is ingenious.  The fact that a bundle of sticks tied together with some torn denim fragments can produce more emotional response than a multi-million dollar special effect makes me want to laugh at Lucas and cohorts.  Having the audience stare intently at a blank screen is the best special effect ever!<br/><br/>Perhaps my favorite detail is the complete absence of advertisement in this film.  Even sci-fi and pseudo-historical movies owe a lot to advertising techniques and imagery to distinguish identities, etc.  A person from any culture could understand this movie given a cursory knowledge of our language.

That was the most terrifying 15 minutes that I've ever witnessed on TV (aside from an unedited suicide on the news), and I haven't forgotten any images yet.<br/><br/>Do you remember the first time you felt fear? The first time that you were terrified that you were in trouble and that you knew that you'd be getting a beating? Those feelings will come back. I have never been paralyzed by fear from anything I've ever seen on any screen of any shape, but the short clip that I saw came very close. As a child, I was interested in the theory of witches but after about 14, I discounted everything. Because of the clip of the Blair Witch Project that I saw, I can't help but think that there is some truth to some of the stories. After seeing the clip of BWP, I've been wary of walking into the woods after dusk. I just can't do it. Every crinkle of every leaf spooks me.<br/><br/>Not to seem condescending or paternal, but I really feel that this movie should only be seen by those over the age of 20 and be in stable mental health.

"Brogan","8","1","2","16 June 1999"," This does to camping what JAWS did for swimming.
","1999 is quite a remarkable year for the cinema.  With the comedy genre coming back strong with the brilliant ANALYZE THIS, now the horror genre is back in it's most chilling form with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  It seemed like that the horror genre was going downhill with such recent horror films as ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,"" ""URBAN LEGEND,"" ""BRIDE OF CHUCKY,"" ""WISHMASTER,"" and the idiotic and trendy ""SCREAM"" movies.  The only recent films that were considered good horror films were ""EVENT HORIZON"" and ""JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.""  Now,  just like 1978 with John Carpenter's ""HALLOWEEN"" the terror in films is brought back to a new figure.  And sad to say, years from now, everybody is going to be copying this film. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young student film-makers who go to the small town in Maryland formerly called ""Blair.""  In this town they wish to uncover the mystery about the Blair Witch legend.  With interviews with the town locals, they tell stories that range from typical bedtime stories to urban legends.  Then the students wish to go out a seek this mysterous ""graveyard"" where some of these burials occur.  As they go out into the woods looking for this graveyard, they begin to get deeper and deeper into a horrible and scary world that they never knew that they would be getting into. This is what I call a SCARY movie.  It makes SCREAM and SCREAM 2 look like a Disney movie.  What makes it scary?  We can all relate to what these filmmakers are going through.  1.) Being lost:  we all get lost, and when we get lost, we get paranoid, confused, and scared.  These people getting lost in the woods can only cause them to not concentrate as much as they should. 2.) The scary noises in the dark:  when we go outside at night, and you hear scary noises that make you wonder what that was. This film has plenty of those, enough to have your heart racing. 3.) Being the outsiders:  these people don't know their way around, they don't know the people or the forrest that well. With this, they are like fish out of water which can also cause confusion.  4.) The terror that lurks:  these people know that there is terror that lurks in the dark with them, and from time to time there will be some very terrifying and scary surprises. This is a horror film with no music soundtrack!  There's no suspense music, no gory make-up, no silly looking person wearing a hockey mask.  This is the kind of terror that is among us.  The kind we think about when we are alone. This is without a doubt one of the best movies of 1999! This is going to be placed among Independent Film Hall of Fame along with PULP FICTION, CITIZEN RUTH, BOUND,  TRAINSPOTTING, and LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  This is a excellent movie, and like the last movie that did this (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) it makes you feel like that you are lost among these unfortunate souls.  Writer/Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have a successful hit on their hands.  They will more than likely be writing and directing some more movies for big studios in the future.  And don't be surprised that the stars will be making television appearances just to alert the pubilc that this is a fictional movie.  Or is it?  A terrfying masterpiece! ***** (out of *****)"

This may not be a perfect motion picture, but it is a perfect movie.  What it sets out to do it does perfectly.  It will scare the absolute crap out of you.  I saw it in a full theater with probably 200 people total.  Afterwards, no one was talking about where they were going to eat or what they were doing next. Everyone was talking about this movie, and I assume that like me, they kept talking about it all night long."

","Amazing, to be so completely terrified without any of the gore or violence which has become so commonplace in ""horror"" movies these days.

","The Blair Witch Project was, without a doubt, one of the most intense films produced in a very long time. It's documentary style not only gave it a real feel, but also allowed the audience to experience the entire story first hand. As the characters spiral into terror of unimaginable proportions, you take the journey right along with them.<br/><br/>Story and character development are superb and the acting is surprisingly realistic. You'll actually have to remind yourself that it isn't a true story. But the nicest thing about this creepy little film is how much is left to your own imagination. With the massive budgets of most commercial films, we're so used to ""seeing"" everything that nothing shocks the average movie goer anymore. In Blair Witch, it's what you DON'T see that really scares you."

","Yeah, yeah, heard enough hype yet?<br/><br/>Were you depressed by 'Phantom Menace'? Did 'Hannibal' make you squirm--because it was so goofy?<br/><br/>I guess third time's a charm.<br/><br/>'Blair Witch' is an amazingly successful film, and one that I had high expectations for (given the LOADS of hype, who wouldn't?). All of my hopes were destined to fall. And dammit, they didn't. Not one bit. This movie is terrifying.<br/><br/>All of the actors are AMAZINGLY convincing. I guess that's becasue they're not acting, or at least not in the Hollywood sense, they're honestly being messed with in the middle of nowhere in the still of night, so the reactions are real. In fact, the only fault I could find is the absence of total wackaloon freakouts. (I probably would have hit myself in the head with a heavy tree limb repeatedly until I calmed down or passed out).<br/><br/>One word of advice: If you are the type of person who equates ""scary"" with ""gore"", or are a HUGE fan of 'Scream' (you know, the nod-and-a-wink film that so many folks thought was sooo good) you will NOT like this film. No gore, no maniac with a knife, and no nudity. ""Dernit, ah guess they dinnit haf enuff munny to get that Heather chick to skimper down to 'er undies. Nuttin like a nekkid chick about to giddit""<-- If this is you, stay away. This movie qualifies as art, and not everyone likes art.

The realism of this film leaves the viewer terrified as he exits the theater, forever peering into the darkness in search of something more."
"Trystero-2","10","1","2","30 July 1999"," A film of True Horror
","This is an absolutely terrifying film that will stick with you long after the lights come up.  Here we have 3 people, lost in the woods, and pursued at night by a terror they can't see or act against.  The Blair Witch Project takes the high ground, and succeeds in delivering its scares the old-fashioned way.  Things that go bump in the night, the plaintive cry of a lost child in the dead of night, the ghostly screams of a friend lost deep in the woods...  all are more effective than any ""Freddy"" or ""Jason"" movie where *nothing* is left to the viewer's imagination.  I applaud the filmmakers' to step back and scare by psychological means, as opposed to brute shock.  The movie's still sending chills up my spine.  My only worry is that as it gains wider release, it will fall upon an American movie-going public too jaded by special effects and too reliant on blood-n-guts, severed heads and cheap thrills to fully appreciate what an incredibly terrifying film this is.  Maybe they should spend a bit of time camped out in the woods, where unseen entities do indeed go bump in the night.<br/><br/>And to those who are perplexed by the finale, you really need to pay *close* attention to the events leading up to it. Do so, and what happens makes perfect sense, and adds to the terror."

","I'm glad I had a good idea what this movie would be like when I went to see it; I think it would have been too much for me had I gone in ""cold.""  After eagerly anticipating this movie all summer, I can honestly say the only thing I was disappointed in was the one idiot in the whole theater (who happened to be behind me) who felt it necessary to continue saying how stupid the movie was throughout the entire thing.  I notice he stayed for the whole movie, however.  No one left, and no one moved or said anything throughout the whole last half of the movie.  It was the quietest theater I've ever been in.  This is the only movie I've been to where I felt more scared an hour after I left the theater than I did while watching it.  If you're expecting ""Scream,"" don't even go--you will hate it.  If you like having the hair on the back of your neck stand up while you're watching a blank screen, you want to catch this one.  I have a feeling it would be scarier on video, at home, alone, in the dark.  I expect better things from Hollywood now that I've seen what these guys could do with a fraction of Hollywood's resources."
"Petrodon","Null","1","2","10 June 1999"," Are you scared of the dark?
","I liked it.  But then, that doesn't say a whole lot about the film now does it.  I like other things too.  This film is frightening, again no justice to it.  And, I think that this movie needs more then just an 'R' rating.  It should come with about tenfold more warnings on it then it has.  This movie needs explanations of how frightening it really is.  So here are a list of things it is most likely in your best interest to know before you see this film.<br/><br/>1. This is not a horror movie.  This film gets into what, in a very realistic way, really scares us, deep inside.  We aren't scared of Freddy Kruger or Jason, because they aren't real and never could be.  This film scares you in a way you haven't ever been scared before, by a movie at least.  The real human terror, the kind you see when you look in the face of Ted Bundy, Andre Chikatilo, and Jeffrey Dahmer is what this film gives you. Only more, because the terror has no face.  The true nature of this film can be detrimental to sanity.<br/><br/>2. This film is not for everyone.  Having an 'R' rating, being a horror flick, maybe you might think this would be a good date movie.  Again you have been warned, this film is not like any other horror film ever made. I don't think those that are feint of heart should go to this film. Parents, don't let your kids go see this, seniors, I respect your age but perhaps this might be a good film to skip. Finally, if you fear the dark,  or ever have in the past, do not see this.  Yes, I liked it, but sometimes I think I should have never have seen this film.<br/><br/>3. This film may be too good at what it does.  The Blair Witch Project could be the scariest film ever made, perhaps too scary.<br/><br/>In short, this film is scared the crap out of me.  I do understand how someone expecting to see a standard horror film might be disappointed at this film, but I wasn't.  If you can take it, then this film comes highly recommended."
"deciphur","10","1","2","30 July 1999"," NOT Pointless. Just beyond your level. NOT A waste of money!
","What is there to say about this one-of-a-kind movie?<br/><br/>This is one of the best thrillers I've seen, although, it isn't for everyone, some people think the movie was pointless, but it is just that this movie was beyond their level! I think that the most interesting thing about this movie was the curiosity of it. I mean, the writers took a big risk, you may be thinking, but it didn't cost them, but still, it was a big risk to leave you hanging.<br/><br/>When something would get to me and I wanted to see what was here or there or in there, I would get up from my seat like if I was there.<br/><br/>A lot of people are complaining that it was like a home video, that is a lie, the only reason they made it like that was to make it reach you more, there were although some rough parts in the movie, but it is just to help you get into it.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie isn't the movie itself, but your own imagination. The movie isn't what is as ""SCARY AS HELL,"" but your mind. After you see this movie, I suggest you discuss it, it will add to the suspense. It should be part of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is for only few. Some people simply don't understand."

","Trust me!!! This movie is not what you think it is. Interesting idea, but not scary or even suspenseful.  However, I think they have created an entertaining film, but its just not scary.<br/><br/>The type of people who will think ""Blair Witch Project"" is scary are people who are afraid to watch programs that start off with: ""WARNING This program contains graphic images of a violent nature. It may not me suitable for all audiences.""<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the ""less is more"" school of thought, but this just didn't do it for me. I'll stick to Hitchcock and Rod Serling for that inspiration.<br/><br/>Horror? NO WAY!!! Psychological Thriller? I think not! But entertaining: Yes. If you want to see an entertaining film then watch ""The Blair Witch Project."" However, if you want to see a scary movie then go rent Disney's ""Escape From Witch Mountain"" because its a lot scarier!!!"

","This movie is unsettling. The night scenes should have been longer and the sound could have been better, but that sense of impending doom is something that has carried over with me even the day after viewing the movie. The realism of the camera and the realism of the actors, who draw you into the woods with them and leave on you the dread so prevalent throughout the film, turns your stomach at times. A girl who viewed the movie right before I did vomited and had to leave. In fact, many people left the theatre before the end of the movie, right around the time Heather turned the camera on herself. This movie builds tension like none other I have ever seen. The beginning is funny and light hearted as the film makers interview locals, then it begins to turn around as the three go deeper and deeper into the woods without a real clue as to where they are going, then it just because disconcerting as the three realize the danger of the night. Anyone who has ever camped out will realize that this movie is the realization of all the horrors that cross your mind while pitching your tent. Walking out, I felt uneasy and the many pictures that will no doubt be talked about for years to come were running through my mind. (especially the last scene, which will go down in horror history as one of the classic scenes of all time)The two friends I went to go see it with left the theatre feeling disappointed, as they felt it just wasn't scary enough. The next day, both called me saying they couldn't sleep the night before, and all of a sudden the movie that had left them disappointed became, for them as it was for me, the first reason in a very long time to leave a light on at night. Don't get too into the hype so as to not allow yourself to appreciate the movie, but also don't listen to the negative reviews. I have found that 90% of those who hated the movie complained of not seeing the ""monster"", or that after viewing many a movie at film festivals (the red flag phrase for film students, or those who think they are film students) they weren't impressed at all. Those who like slasher movies will be bored and those who attend film school at NYU will be pissed they didn't think of it first.Those of us who still cringe when we see ""The Exorcist"", can barely watch the screen in ""Alien"", feel the chill on the back of our neck when the kid in ""The Shining"" recites RedRum over and over again, will love this movie. It will leave certain images in your head, certain ones that you will want to forget, and will leave you in your car, or in your house, realizing the truly freightening nature of this film. It is, in one word, intense."

","If at all possible, see this on the big screen with as few people as possible. I saw it in a packed theater, with a majority hoping for a Hollywood ending. While this movie does not make the viewer scream, there are images and sounds and inanimate objects, especially at the end, that I will not forget for a long time. I did have goosebumps on top of goosebumps several times. As the day went on, and I was able to think about it more, the more creeped out I got. I see a lot of horror movies. Jaws didn't keep me from going into the water. Psycho didn't keep me from taking a shower. Blair Witch made it very hard for me to turn off the light to go to bed.

The style of this film realy pushes you to use your imagination, even though there are times in the film when you don't want to, but are draw in to.

"Syko-2","9","1","2","3 June 1999"," Original, frightening film
","I caught this film recently, and have to say that it's the ONLY horror film that actually scared me, mostly due to the fact that the actors are all unknown, and are excellent actors at that. I've recommended this film to EVERYBODY, and can't praise it enough"
"baumer","10","1","2","30 July 1999"," A tense and frightening film. Completely original.
","I think I am going to be the reviewer in here that is somewhat down the middle with my assessment of the film.  I have been reading reviews and comments about the film for about a month now, and most of the comments have been either a) it is the scariest film ever orat least since Halloween or b) it is absolute crap.  Well if I had to lean one way it would be towards a). But even though this film is scary, it honestly could have been the scariest film ever made if only for one small thing, and I'll get into that in a moment.<br/><br/>As much as this film is a horror by definition, it is more of a psychological study of the human spirit.  This movie asks the question "" How much can a human being take before we lose it?""  And on that level The Blair Witch Project is perfect.  We see three people that start off with good intentions and ambitious spirits and then we watch them unravel as fear sets in.  And all throughout this film I kept asking myself how would I react if I was in the same situation?  And the answer that I came to was,probably the same way that these three did.  When you have human beings in what is seemingly a dire problem and an impossible location, how does that affect you?  Do you laugh about it?  Do you freak out on each other?  Do you look for blame?  Are you frightened?  The answer to those questions is ""Yes"". You do all of them.  The characters in this film are real people and what we see them go through is real.  And that is what makes this film as good as it is.  We feel that we are watching this happen to three people that we know because the film actually gives us time to understand these characters.  And that is good.  But what could have made the film a level above any horror film made before it is that we should of had more time at night when everything is happening and less time during the day when they are starting to lose their minds.  As I said, the way it is done is very good in it's execution, because we are watching realistic footage of how someone would be after five days of being lost in the wilderness with very little food, cold nights, and things going bump in the night.  But could you just for one second imagine how the film would of been if it concentrated more on things that go bump in the night than the psychological elements that it also gives us?  This would have been the personification of fear.  Having said that, make no mistake about it, this film is scary.  It is much more frightening than any film that has come out this decade.  And what makes it scary is the fear of not knowing.  No one knows what it is that they are hearing.  No one knows what it is that you see in that bundle of wood.  It's red and wet and looks like blood and enamel, but what exactly is it?  Not knowing what it is that is scaring these three people is terrifying.  I have been out of the theater for at least a half an hour now and my heart is still beating a little faster, it still hasn't recovered from all that this film put me through.  But as scary as it was, it could have had more night time stuff and less day time lead up to what happens at night.  The film established the fact that all the scary stuff happens when the sun sets, so why not give the audience what it came for?  And the only reason I am saying this is because it's not like the movie ran out of ideas, it's too smart for that, but it's just that they gave us ( the audience ) a chance to catch our breath.  And I like it when I can't breath from fear.  I like it when I feel as helpless and as frightened as the people in this movie.  And as much as I was, I wanted more.  I thirsted for more.<br/><br/>To know all that this movie is, is to appreciate it.  The fact that they went out and concentrated on scaring us and not on seeing how many special effects they could fit into one scene is refreshing.  And it is wonderful. These guys know what the epitome of fear is.  They must be fans of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween.  It's just too bad that they couldn't keep us that scared for longer than they did.<br/><br/>Blair Witch is a very scary film.  To say that it is a terrible film is to not understand the meaning of horror.  To say that you didn't enjoy the film is another story.  I admire this film for all that it is and all that it wanted to be and all that it came so close to being.  If only it didn't stray off course as little as it did, if only.....  Having said that, I really do like this film and it really did scare me.  You should see this, no matter what anyone says to you.  Give the guys a chance.  They had the courage and the talent to go out on a limb and make this happen, it should at least be rewarded for that.  And if you do want to see a scary film, you won't find one better in the last ten years.  And that is all that really matters. Because even though it could have been scarier, there is no film that I've seen in recent years that can hold a candle to it. 8.5/10"

","When I left the theater, there were people who whispered words of disapointment, and yet, I had to wonder why.  Granted, the movie did not have the big-budget, special-effects, that you find in the current Horrors and Thrillers, such as Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer.  Other than that, it was so much more.  First off, this movie presents the unknown as the threat, not some guy in a mask.  Seeing that guy in a mask limits your imagination, while this unknown can be anything, and it is to each individual audience member.  Next, the acting was infinitely better than that in any big-budget box-office smash.  These people are real, and appear that way, unlike the unbalanced and weak characters in the Screams and I Knows.  The three main stars work so well together, that it appears to be a reality.  Also, with the cinematagraphy, it actually felt that the audience was right there with the characters.  I can not say enough about this film, besides that it is a refreshing break from the spoon-feed horrors that have been shoved down our throats the last couple of years, with its Hitchcock-ian style, a definite return to something that we have not seen in a long time."

I was so glad to see a movie that wasn't 98% special effects, and could scare me enough to look over my shoulder at night when I'm walking home. No movie has done that since The Excersist, which I still have bad dreams about.  But this wasn't a gore movie, it wasn't a teen slasher movie, it was dealing with the unknown.

","As I sit here and listen to ""Josh's Blair Witch Mix"", I can't help thinking back to earlier in the evening when I first got my chance to see this much talked-about film.  It was kind of slow but funny in parts in the beginning. Towards the middle, the drama of the movie unfolds, showing the acting talents of the 'stars' of the film, and some of the creepiness starts to crawl up your spine, despite the occasional repetitiveness of the fighting and bickering that goes on.  Then, the end comes out of nowhere hitting you right between the eyes like a hammer!  Heather Donahue deserves an oscar in my opinion for an absolutely chilling and convincing performance.  She is an absolute wonder.  This movie will scare the living heck right out of you. Honest.  When Heather apologizes late in the film, with tears in her eyes, you know fear.  An unbelievable cinematic achievement (and thank your lucky stars that it is unbelievable...).  See it at all costs!  This is a MOVIE!"

","This film is a welcome return to the ""old school"" techniques of making horror films. A 90's film with such suspense, Hitchcock would have been proud. The directors of this film went back to basics in a big way, and in so doing have scored one of the most innovative and smart films to come along in a very long, long time. The only thing that might hurt this film come Oscar nomination time, is the fact that it is a horror film. It deserves all of the accolades and recognition it no doubt will garner however. A true HORROR film in every sense of the word. There were moments during which you could have heard a pin drop in the theatre. The audience was totally captivated by this film. One of the most powerful films in terms of sheer emotional content, in at least a couple of decades. Maybe longer.<br/><br/>Brilliant concept. Brilliant story. Brilliant acting. Will definitely make you think twice about ever going camping again. The last scene alone will probably haunt you for a good time to come. An instant 'Classic' that just may be the best horror film ever made. Imagination is a scary thing."

","Blair Witch is unique in many ways. Filmed as a mockumentary, it makes the viewer believe the things he is seeing. There are no blood or  guts, or any visible villians. Its the farthest thing from hollywood that I've ever seen. And the film makers pull it off beautifully. The lowres cameras only add to the chill, and the actors are stunning in potraying their characters. it is actually the actors who designed their own dialog, and did the shooting, though the writer/directors have to be credited for the genius of the premise, and the mind-numbing, painfully plausible ending. My girlfriend bawled, she was so frightened. One note: don't go see this movie in a crowded, noisy audience-- full of high school students. someone actually turned on a gameboy while the movie was going on, and these ditsy airheads wouldn't stop talking.

It's very uncommon nowadays to goto a movie and not hear anyone talking, murmuring, whispering. This was one of those times.<br/><br/>TBWP scared me.  It was very easy to place myself in the woods with these kids, and to pretend I was one of their group.  My emotions went from slight laughter to concern to sorrow to anger to betrayal to fear over and over again.<br/><br/>No movie has ever filled me with the suspense and the sheer fear of the dark like TBWP.  From beginning to end, I found myself not able to move, in fear I may miss something.<br/><br/>When the film ended, everyone in the theatre just sat there; no one got up for at least 30 seconds.  Families and couples and friends all walked out not uttering a word to each other; it was like everyone was at a funeral and everyone's best friend was in the casket.<br/><br/>I, myself, left the theatre in disbelief and somewhat mildly shocked.  If you can put yourself up there on the screen with the kids, you can actually feel their pain.  This film was WONDERFULLY done.<br/><br/>I can honestly rate TBWP as one of the greatest horror/suspense films of the decade.  I will see it again; perhaps tonight.

","Forget about all those silly teen horror films of the past, its' time to be really scared. Imagine yourself lost in the woods with no food, two people you don't know, and not only are you cold but a supernatural legend is constantly following you and harrassing you. Would you be scared? you know I would. That is the case of the three young filmmakers in question, who mysteriously dissapear into the Black Hills of Maryland in their desperate attempt to film a documentary on the famed Blair Witch. Being as naive as they are (thanks to their bossy director Heather) they laugh at the warnings given to them by the locals they interview, including this insane lady, Mary Brown, and venture into the woods, never to be seen again, a few years later their equipment is found underneath an abandoned house in the middle of the woods, and thanks to Haxan Films, we see their tragic story unfold before our very eyes, is this footage real or is it a put on, well, you be the judge, I know the real answer. Just have fun watching this movie in a darkened theater with total strangers and witness it for yourself. You'll feel like you are really lost with these people and you'll become pretty attached to them as well. Once this film is over you will find it very hard to forget it, and you will definitely will not want to be alone in the dark or camp any time soon. Like I said, Be Afraid."
"Harrison","10","1","2","28 July 1999"," The Most Frightening (and Smartest) Movie Ever
","The Blair Witch Project is easily the most frightening film that I have ever seen. It taps into a common sense of fear in the audience: the fear of unexpected noises in the night, as well as the source of those noises, when there is no hope of rescue. There are some who say that this movie was not at all scary. These people were obviously raised by the television in such a way that they have no imagination and no tolerance for intriguing dialogue. And that really is the key to enjoying this movie: Every word that is said is a key to understanding the situation in the film, the mythology of the Blair Witch, and why the three filmmakers choose to record their situation on tape, rather than experiencing it with their own eyes.<br/><br/>
The Blair Witch Project is an achievement for daringly creative, low-budget filmmaking. Definitely worth all of the nightmares that it will undoubtedly cause."

The movie builds in visual and emotional intensity as the increasing plight of these three lost teens grows more and more sinister , hour after hour. Much is left unexplained, and unrevealed, leaving the audience to make its decisions for itself. This is a refreshing change from having CGI slammed down our collective throats. The simplistic nature of the cinematography grasps us in its fist and holds on until the final, harrowing scene. After it was over, I was uncertain what to think. What had I just seen? The images keep flooding in, usually while you're trying to drift off to sleep. This is what disturbs me the most.

Just like in the original Haunting, you don't see a single ghost or monster and isn't that what made The Haunting so scary?  That is what makes this movie scary, you let your imagination do the work when you hear what the young film makers are hearing.  I have to admit, people are walking into the movie expecting to see a masterpiece of horror and they walk out thinking that they wasted their time.  This movie is a ""either you liked it or hated it"" flick and you are going to hear both sides argue over this issue.  You just have to go and see it for yourself and make up your mind."

It would be unfair of me to critique their accomplishment after learning so much of the plot before I watched the film.

Even doing that it's hard to not become so terrified that you leave the theatre at the end shaking.  I did.  As fun as it may be, don't allow your friends to believe it's real either.  We're talking psychological and emotional abuse.  There's no gore, no violence, and yet this movie is more terrifying than Halloween and maybe even The Exorcist.  I didn't sleep at night after watching The Blair Witch Project, and I may not be able to sleep for many nights to come.<br/><br/>All that scary stuff aside, this film is monumental to modern film making. I have never seen anything like it before, and you can bet there may be a handful of copycats to come.  It is not so much that the directors came up with something original, because I can assure you that they did not, but they created something so utterly successful that it could possibly discourage many people from going into films, simply because they know they couldn't compete.  Chances are, they were lucky -- all the cards fell into place for them.  They found fabulous actors (especially a COMPLETELY believable four-year-old), developed a great premise that actually worked better with a smaller budget, and began a promotional endeavor that will be documented in history books.  Anyone could have been lucky enough to do this, it just happened to be the guys at Haxan Films who found that luck.<br/><br/>See this film.  Watch it with friends and be sure to plan on staying up all night afterwards.  You may not notice it for a while, but by the end of the film you could realize that you've been camping with Heather, Josh, and Mike the whole time.  That is what will scare you.

In the same sense, all comments about their 'filming' the movie up to the end make no sense - how would we see the footage any other way? I suppose that films that feature unkillable humans, or high schools populated with models makes sense? SHEESH!!!<br/><br/>Secondly: This move is more of a test of the viewer's intelligence / creativity. If you need a movie to tell you to be scared thru: music, explicit gore, etc. then this is not the movie for you (i.e.: You just got off work and are dozing thru it, waiting for a character to explain the story).

","I think this movie is way over hyped. Yes, it is a brand new spin on the horrow genre and yes the idea is unique, but that doesn't necessarily make this a great movie. Out of the 87 minutes, about 15 are just downright creepy, and the other 72 minutes kind of leave you asking for more, or atleast what the trailers and the website promises. It is very refreshing though to see a good movie actually scaring you without using gory effects or grotesque computer imagery. This one lets your imagination do the work, and work it does!

","This is not a movie that will make you jump in your seat - it will keep you up at night. In a genre where most of the films of its kind are based on a tired and exhausted formula, The Blair Witch Project gets past the usual equation to achieve something even greater - a true horror movie. This proves once again that a big budget movie with hundreds of digitalized special effects and a cast of $15 million stars is not necessary for a good movie. The only thing that keeps the movie lines long and the theaters packed with people who have seen the movie multiple time is a revolutionary and truly disturbing film (as in the horror genre) - this movie is just that. All too often the market is flooded with pseudo-horror films like ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,"" ""Urban Legends,"" and ""The Haunting."" Those movies go for the cheap, and short lived jolt. This movie will linger and out last its running time - probably until bed time."
"PNuke","10","1","2","25 July 1999"," Best horror movie in years!!
","Less can be more, and for 'The Blair Witch Project' less means more realistic and more terrifying.  Despite (or because of) no gore or special effects, a better horror movie will not be released this year.  The mockumentary follows three young film students into the Maryland woods in search of the legend of the Blair Witch.   The movie itself offers little about the history of the legend.  Glints of information are presented as hearsay and gossip from the interviewed townsfolk and a turn of the century text on the little known legend.  It works to the picture's benefit, as does the grainy feel of the handheld footage comprising the entire picture.  The result is an  impossibly heavy tone of mystery, paranoia, and hysteria that builds layer upon nerve fraying layer.  The writers and directors understood what it takes to make an effective horror movie.  They constructed likeable and believable characters.  We're not watching a platnum bimbo and mindless frat boy being stalked by a faceless menace, we like and want the three young students to make it.  Secondly, they understood that what we can't see is always scariest.  The beast is never as frightening or as real on screen as it is in our craven minds.  'The Blair Witch Project' is the ultimate campfire story."
"Kaimi","10","1","2","24 July 1999"," Great movie! Very different from anything else this year, or maybe ever
","Very unusual movie.  Scary but not in the same way as ""Scream"" and the like. Good acting by all, especially Heather Donahue who had some great parts including a sad, emotionally charged monologue-type part near the end (I will say no more so as not to spoil).  Michael C. Williams also was quite good and the actors had great chemistry as the the slowly disintegrating friendship / work relationship fell to pieces.<br/><br/>Don't blink or you could miss something.  This movie is totally unforgiving to the casual moviegoer- there is quite a bit of foreshadowing but nothing helpful, and if you miss a part it is gone, never to return.  Go to the bathroom before the movie starts, order only a small soda so you will not need to go during the film.  Like real life, the film has parts where it seems to slow down.  Then suddenly, something crucial to the story appears, and then it's gone.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most eerie part is the ""documentary"" framing device.  The film is totally loyal to this fiction, though at times this makes it seem a bit unrealistic (especially at the end, when cameras are still rolling in the direst of emergency situations, and perfectly focused).  Still the use of this framework gives the film an amazingly eerie quality.  It is like a Discovery Channel documentary, gone horrifyingly wrong.  No creepy music, no cheesy special effects, just the story and the actors, and that is quite enough."

When you are five or six years old we are not naturally afraid of men with masks that stalk babysitters or men with hockey masks that haunt horny campers.  Those are things that are taught to us by the news or by watching enough scary movies.  But what we are afraid of, even though we don't know why, is the dark, strange noises in the middle of the night and our own subconscious.  We are afraid to go downstairs when the lights are off because we don't know what is waiting down there to get us. And the reason we are scared of these things is simply that it makes us think of death or extreme pain.  The Blair Witch Project preys on those fears.  And as long as it takes to get into those primal fears, the setup is worth the payoff.  What we witness is three people that could be budds that we went to school with.  They are not caked with makeup and set in the perfect light to make them Jennifer Love Hewitt or Joshua Jackson.  They are three people that are tired, unshaven, hungry, cold, deprived and scared out of their minds.  They are a microcosm of every single one of us put in the same situation.  I have never seen a film like this one before and only a handful of times have I felt close to what I did watching this film.  First there was Jaws, that made me afraid the water.  Halloween made me afraid of the night and Nightmare On Elm Street made me afraid to go to sleep.  There are a few others that made me feel similar to this, but no movie has ever made me feel exactly the way Blair Witch did.  In here you feel like what is happening is real.  8mm cameras can do that.  You are watching a home video and what you can't see scares the hell out of you.  We hear what they hear, we feel what they feel and we are prone to curl up in a ball and wait for the inevitable.  I have seen this movie twice now.  The first time I saw it for myself, the second time I saw it to watch the reactions of the people in the audience.  When the nights came and all the ruckus started, people ( audience ) curled up almost into fetal positions, they grabbed onto whatever arm was next to them and their breathing became a little heavier.  Male or female it didn't matter.  No matter if this film is fact or fiction, it attacks everything that makes us afraid and it exploits it like perhaps no other film has ever done or will ever do.  <br/><br/>Now I have read the comments that dismiss this film as fluff and how it is not really scary, and that may be true for some people, but for the majority of the people that have seen this, it hits us with such force that it does cause you to keep the lights on at night.  This is ingenius film making and even though it is not exactly what people would consider on par with say Citizen Kane ( only on a technical level ) you will not find a film that manipulates our senses and our primarily our fear more than this one, and on that level, this is one of the best films ever made.  <br/><br/>I can't say enough about this film.  It is a psychological trip through fear.  It makes us feel lost and it keeps us fearing that these people will never get out alive.  And it is true what people say: the last shot of this film will scare you more than any shot in the history of film.  That is high praise coming from me, I grew up on horror films.  You can take a shot of Michael Myers rising methodically in the background in the first Halloween, the opening death of Chrissie Watkins in Jaws, the dinner table scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the shower scene from Psycho, the boiler room scene in Nightmare On Elm Street, the scene where Hicks discovers the aliens in the ceiling from Aliens or even any one of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left ( that is some pretty select company ) and still they will not surpass the raw emotion and primal fear that you will feel in the last five minutes of this film.  <br/><br/>Blair Witch is pure fear.  It should be seen by everyone at least once.  If I could meet any of the five major players in this film ( the three ""actors"" and the two writer/directors ), I would thank them for showing me that someone hasn't forgotten how to make a scary film.  This is what fear should be.  Whoever makes the next ""Hollywood"" horror film has giant shoes to fill. Good luck."

One reviewer said the logic was flawed, that the campers should have just followed the stream to civilization.  The point was the campers couldn't leave the woods no matter what they tried.  They were directed by forces beyond their control.  Unfortunately the ending was cryptic and therefore I feel a lot of the audience did not understand what they saw.

But anyway it appears to be very very real. Unfortunately for the filmmakers, the scariness increases.. up until the very end (which to be honest freaked me out totally).

","I was fortunate enough to obtain an underground copy of this movie through a friend of mine. Compared to the sort of horror movies that are routinely produced, it stands out as truly well conceived and assembled. The concept, the acting, the cinematography, and virtually all other elements are dead-on. Unfortunately, they went so far with it and did such a fantastic job that the few weak spots seemed very noticeable to me. For example, the movie is comprised of patched together footage from the cameras 'found later' - and almost all of this footage feels authentic. There are a few shots, though, which seemed as if no one would have been available to hold the camera, and I found that distracting. Also, like so many American swine, I am jaded to the extent that purely suggested horror seems a bit weak to me (though everyone I've shown the movie to has been terrified, so maybe it's just me). People have been saying that this film will change the horror industry, but beyond the predictable knock-offs, I don't see that ""method film-making"" is likely to have much impact in the long run.

"Danny-87","8","1","2","10 May 1999"," Near-masterpiece!
","This landmark pseudo-documentary ""film"" has all the hallmarks of cult-classicdom, which is a gross injustice since it deserves much wider acclaim and audiences.  The filmmakers penetrate with fearless conviction and wanton abandon the very nexus and recesses of our psyche to illuminate - in all its terrifying spectrum - a mind-blowing vortex of fear, desire, anxiety, and repressed primordial behaviour.  This anti-""film"" seeks to immolate the form and style of the medium (it eschews the montonous regularity of the grunge / metal soundtracks; the token, big-breasted, half-naked virginal sophomores; the stupidity and delinquency of the characters; the visceral SFX gore and 'dice-and splice'  bloodletting so enamoured of horror maestros; the requisite 'name' stars; and the predictable and strategically configured plotlines all adhering to the formulaic traditions of the genre).<br/><br/>Instead the viewer is bombarded with technically inept production values, crude sound, variable focus and lighting, Cassavetes-style improvisational rambling, jerky and mistake-ridden mobile camera takes.  The whole cinematic world, its diagesis, because of the aforesaid rather than in spite of it, renders this truly harrowing and relentless excursion as an unnervingly claustrophobic and intensely warped psychodrama of the very nucleus of our mind and sanity!  The devastating realism, the astonishing simplicity of such a stunning idea (why didn't I ever think of it!?), the evocative and eerie odour of the unknown, and the adrenalin-rush tension all evoke the grand testaments of the classic horror arc of Val Lewton's atmospheric ""Isle of the Dead', ""Cat People"" and ""The Seventh Victim"", to early Polanski (remember the brilliant and subtle terrors of ""Knife in the Water"" and the masterful ""Repulsion""), to the gradual ascent of brooding tension and uneasy confinement of Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and Tobe Hooper's vastly under-rated ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".  In no way does this film reference the whirlwind ""stuck in the woods"" misanthropy and explicit violence of revenge films like Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"" and Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit on Your Grave"".<br/><br/>As an expose and treatise of the subdivide between fiction and documentary the ""film"" works on multifaceted planes:  documentary within film (and vice versa), the interplay between the characters, the filmmakers and the viewer, the mimicry and artifice of the celluloid process that is so glaringly interwoven into the lives of the victims, and the perceived notions of what constitutes fiction-realism.  Furthermore, important themes of the symbolic grounding of ""woman-as-witch' cum maternal earth goddess/mother, the socio-political vanguard of the mythology of the American city/country divide, are all grounded in latent but nonetheless tacit modes of this film's self-referential discourse.  It also posits the Nietzchean question vis-a-vis ""if we are stripped of our normalcy do we become the masters of our destiny and do we appropriate the knowledge and power and mastery of others to survive in hostile, predatory environments?  Prevalent too is the almost atavistic primal elements of the earth - wind, water, fire, earth, light, cold - that obstructs and railroads the characters (and thus ourselves) via stress, sleep deprivation, hunger, alienation and pain.<br/><br/>Flaws include: (1) if all hope is vain then why do they keep filming right to the end?  (2) When one of the three goes missing, why resort to the genre cliche of doing the direct opposite of what you would expect any logical and sane sentient being to do (in this case, flash the power lights around like it was the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony lightshow spectacular!).  (3) The penchant for over-reacting, particularly from Heather, suggests something is very awry with this ""doco"".  (4) A far more potent ending would be the absence of credits as this reinforces the fictionalised nature of what preceded.  (5) And the ending, though thoroughly gripping and suitably open-ended, seems a tad contrived and forced (however I will reserve full judgement here as the videotape I saw was very hazy and lacked clarity in this end sequence).<br/><br/>The excellent trailer utilises the unsettling and heartfelt soliloquy to camera by the desolate Heather as she curls up in the dead of night with only the light of the bulb rallied against the unseen echoes of screaming surrounding the tent.  Overall, this is a riveting, mesmerising and enthralling work of brilliant simplicity that radiates a rare multifaceted intricacy.  I don't care what anyone says - I consider the film a NEAR-MASTERPIECE (I've now seen it twice)!  And if you, like me, absolutely detest nine out of every ten films made these days, here is that precious gem that restores your faith in the aesthetic and artistic realms of the filmmaking craft.  Personal opinions aside unfortunately, gross box office potential is severely disadvantaged by the low-budget, its style and technique, the genre, and the provocative, almost confrontational nature of the plot.  This will only appeal to the secondary strata of cinema audiences (indie gurus, theorists, academics, cineastes, horror groupies and film buffs will adore) but popular demographics brought up on a diet of fatuous high tech 'spill and thrills' will stay away in droves.  Word of mouth will be very strong particularly if it is further worked around the international film festival circuit, as already evident on the internet, and critical response should be favourable.  A gross injustice when a brilliant little film like this with modest parentage succeeds against all odds.<br/><br/>8/10"

""The Blair Witch Project"" is honestly one of the scariest movies ever made. More impressively, there are no cheap scares: nothing jumps out of the bushes and startles you, and you're not assaulted with dismemberments or beheadings. You just sit there in silence, with shivers running down your spine and terror gripping you in the belly. But how can a movie that cost $25,000 possibly be scarier than every other big-budget horror-fest ever produced?<br/><br/>It is scary because it is vague. The filmmakers wisely observed that nothing they could put on screen would be as terrifying as what you could imagine. Their tools are a few sticks and 10 lines of well-placed dialogue, but they manage to scare you more than any CG effect ever could.<br/><br/>It is scary because it is so real. The characters are you, or people you know. It's one thing to hear a famous actress's trained scream in the face of some hideous monster; it's quite another to hear a `real' person's hoarse, panic-stricken shrieks when all they can see is trees and darkness. The former may give you a start, but the latter chills you to the bone.<br/><br/>Go see `The Blair Witch Project'. It will remind you how fun it is to be really, truly scared.

"Rerun-2","Null","1","2","21 July 1999"," Supremely effective horror movie
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the most terrifying and effective horror movies I have ever seen, hands-down.  It is not scary because it throws lots of gory, expensive special effects at us, or had characters who do idiotic things like walk into a house occupied by a chainsaw-wielding madman or hide in the closet when a killer is stalking them.  It is scary because of what it doesn't show us, because it knows that the things that make the noises in the night are never as frightening as the noises themselves.<br/><br/>I guess the term ""horror movie"" isn't quite right for this film.  That is better reserved for the kind of movie I have described above.  This is more like an experiment in fear, in tapping the nameless dread we feel when we hear...something...moving around in the darkness outside our flimsy tent. When you are lost, and just can't find your way back.  Those are fears I can relate to.  I think almost anyone can.  ""Horror movies"" place characters in implausible situations, so we can distance ourselves from the action. ""Blair Witch"" draws us further in, so we are fascinated even as we can barely stand to watch.<br/><br/>The movie's setup involves three student filmmakers who gather in the little Maryland town of Burkittsville to shoot a documentary about a witch that used to live in the woods at its borders.  They never return, and their footage is found a year later.  The ""movie"" consists of the footage pieced together in chronological order to show what happened.<br/><br/>They interview several people about the witch; some are ambivalent, some disbelieving.  The conversations are believable and not contrived; they are like something you would see in a documentary.  They are also a warning, although the students do see it as such (one woman is asked if she believes in the Blair Witch, and she grins and replies ""I believe it enough not to go up there."")<br/><br/>They head into the woods to shoot footage of famous places in the witch legend, where unspeakable horrors were visited upon children and hunters. Gradually, things begin to get ominous.  Strange piles of stone turn up outside their tent.  At night, they can hear the noises of something moving around, something that refuses to show itself.  At one point, they stumble across a grove filled with bizarre, frightening stick figures, which hang from trees, twisting silently in the breeze.<br/><br/>They plan to spend only a weekend there, but the map disappears, and they appear to be going in circles.  They are out of food, and worse, cigarettes. Every night they are harrassed by whatever is stalking them.  Heather, the project leader, tries to maintain order but the cameraman, Josh, and sound man, Mike, begin to question her ability to get them out of the woods, leading to gender struggles and a gradual breakdown of nerves.  I have been in situations like this, although far less dire, and people generally behave as these students do.<br/><br/>This is not a movie where things jump out at them in from dark corners or where gore and slime drips all over the screen.  It is presented as a documentary, in a simple, realistic fashion, but with the growing realization that the characters are being hunted by supernatural forces. At first they react by simply not believing it; they seek rational explanations (""Did you ever see 'Deliverance'?"" asks Josh, suggesting they are being preyed upon by unwelcoming locals).  Soon scientific postulation gives in to fear, because they simply can't ignore the evidence.<br/><br/>A movie like this is deeply unsettling in its implications, but it is exhilarating in its boldness and message that lots of money and big name actors are not needed to make a scary film.  It was shot on a shoestring budget by a little-known film company and directors.  The characters are given the names of the actors.  Everything is ""real"" as far as the movie is concerned, and that was real enough for me to decide I won't be camping again for awhile."

Isn't it ironic that what I feel is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made was done by two college film-school buddies, with their credit cards, with no-name actors, with no blood, special effects or violence, and with camcorders!  I'm tempted to never pay for a movie again.  Those characters were so real!  I found myself telling them to calm down and try to pull together, I wanted them to get out of there alive.

The acting, dialogue, and everything else drips with reality which makes you wonder if the film you're watching really isn't the footage discovered beneath that cabin.

I mean people with this kind of ability are a dime a dozen.<br/><br/>And as for the budget, I dunno maybe these guys got swindled by whoever did the film transfer and the scene editing, but $30 000 seems kind of high.If you want to see a truly effective use of a low-budget watch El Mariachi instead.<br/><br/>The fact that this film was in the theaters is also a sign of the state of decay that hollywood is now in. Movie production costs have gotten out of control. Actors believe it is their birth-right to receive 10s of millions of dollars per picture. And the studios while managing this kind of money, are now too timid to make anything that is ground-breaking anymore.

By not directly showing the Blair Witch (or *whatever* was creeping out the characters), they knew your mind would make up something worse than anything they would have shown.<br/><br/>Even Hitchcock would have been writhing uncomfortably in his sleep, and like most of the audience at the showing I went to, he probably would have probably gasped out loud at the ending."

","The Blair Witch Project is a landmark in horror filmmaking and should become a sleeper hit upon its release in July.  While not a perfect film, this sure is a damn scary one--scary enough that I had to have my eyes closed quite a number of times during it (in fact, I'm predicting future anxiety attacks among some audience members).  The movie is about three college students who go into the woods to film a documentary on the so-called Blair Witch, and never return.  Their footage, of course, is found one year later, and thus the film itself is seen through the eyes (rather through the camera) of the students themselves.<br/><br/>There is not a single cheap scare in the whole film, and that's what makes it so frightening: we are constantly waiting to see something.  Indeed, I often had my eyes closed when the screen was totally blank (as it often is, giving way to one of the most significant sound tracks in recent years). It knows how to prop the generic conventions as well--whenever the sun goes down, the monsters come up.<br/><br/>The movie builds an incredible sense of realism (the acting is pitch-perfect), however it disobeys the laws by making the characters ballsier that they ever should be.  It's hard to believe the story when we are saying ""No one would ever do that!"" (ex. turning on all your lights at night when you hear bloody-murder noises) Yet the film is destined to be a (cult at least) classic.  Matriarchal (witch/mom references) and political (""You can't get lost in America"") undertones are sure to stir up a argumentative following about what it all means.

"nickl","Null","1","2","6 January 2001"," Break out your notebooks again...
","There is constant debate over this film, if it were in my power I would end it, but no man's voice should be silenced... given some guidance? perhaps, absolutely, most definitely yes. You watch ""Blair Witch,"" and you're not watching a bad film. You're actually watching one of the most important horror films of the 90's. ""Blair Witch,"" ""Scream,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" and even the re-release of ""Exorcist"" were the most important horror/thriller box-office takes of recent movie making history. With ""Blair Witch"" you see how simply a story can be told, with a budget that isn't even a 1/6 of Tom Cruise's payroll for any film it is taken in effectively. Problems in the movie and dislike in the story was inevitable since the entire film was shot from one of three subjective points-of-view. You either agree with Heather, Mike and Josh, or you don't.. if you don't, you sit there and pity them for their inability to deal with (what most people might think) is a ""normal"" situation. Seeing this in theaters on opening day, kids were yelling out ""shut up you stupid b****,"" as Heather was screaming, looking for Mike in the old house in the woods, and going ""ooohhh, scaaaaaarrrryyy!"" when we first realize that the trio is actually being terrorized by someone or something. I watched these kids, observing their hypocrisy, and noted it. These are the same kids who thought ""Scream"" and its sequels were the best horror movies ever, when it followed the same story-structure that ever horror film made in the last twenty-five years have! That pattern being: maniac killer, blood and cuts, hot chicks, scenes constructed to make you jump - but no real genuine horror, nothing psychologically grounded. This is where I think most people did not see the marvel of creativity behind ""The Blair Witch Project"". It is the kind of film that has you asking yourself, and your friends what you would do if you were in that situation. That's how it's 40 page outline was written. The audience makes their own horror, in a way, provided with certain steps like little wooden figures hanging from trees, mounds of death stones and the creepy echo of children laughing in the darkness of a woods YOU KNOW there shouldn't be kids roaming around in. To me, there's a basic two formula method of how a film goes bad, after it's already scripted: <br/><br/>1. The film has a poor interpretation from the audience 2. Or the film has a poor interpretation from the director, producers<br/><br/>Of course I'm not ignoring the ""can't make a good movie from a bad script, but you can make a bad movie from a good script,"" rule. But once the movie is already on the big screen, it's up to the mind of the viewer to make the final judgment,<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" was a landmark for independent movie making in the United States for the 90's, along with being one of the most important horror films of that decade. Following the Hitchcock formula of ""less is more"" it allows you to wonder what is just off to the sides of the camera shots, and what the three characters were seeing. Its strength was in the auditory sense giving the full panic of the three protagonists. All the while teasing the audience with a limited amount of visual effect. All in all, the horror of the film comes not from what so many other horror films give: ""what you see is what you get."" ""Blair Witch"" makes it into ""what you hear is what you get, what you see.. is up to you to decide what's just beyond the reach of the camera.""<br/><br/>My advise, watch the film again. Truly put yourself in their wet, muddy shoes and remember the last time you were in those kinds of woods. Now I'll ask you: if you thought the movie was no big deal, take a trip up to Maryland, pick a forest and go camping.. if you hesitate, break out your movie guideline and script notebooks. Time to revise...<br/><br/>Above average acting. Excellent independent film-making. 8.4/10"
"aesgaard41","9","1","2","5 January 2001"," Not Based On A True Story !
","It was George Romero who set the standard for the stark realism in horror films, and this movie has also set more standards for creating a movie that has caused more tourists to settle upon the same sleepy little Maryland town than when Confederate troops stalked the same hills a hundred years ago. With a legend based loosely on Tennessee's Bell Witch and Rhode Island's Mercy Brown, this movie has a very simple if not slightly illogical premise: three college kids look for a ghost in the wilderness. I might have been the only one in my school to have taken such a feat and I'd bet even money that no one else would have joined me for the simple matter of having something better to do. While much of the movie's production baffles me, it does have more of a coming of age style that a horror flick; compare this with Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me"" and you know what I mean. The movie doesn't really explain what happens to the three would-be film-makers, but such a point isn't important as long as the film hits it's mark and it sure did with me. when I saw the Sci-Fi's channel's documentary-style promo for the movie, I was already interested enough in the paranormal and freaked out enough to think this movie was true, but a lot of logical thinking and lateral research to look into the case set me straight. I don't understand the people condemning this movie who criticize it for not being scary. They just prove to me just how conditioned we are as a society to violence. Everyone I talk to just about agree what in the world does a chain-wielding serial killer in a hockey mask have to do with a haunted house! A true ghost story will always tap into the primal fears of terror in the human mind while the sensationalism of gore and violence always turns into little more than a pass the time schlock. To me, The Blair Witch Project starts out as a neat little ghost story that turns scary as you worry about the sanctity of these three campers who get lost while filming a documentary in the middle of no where. Yes, a pile of rocks is not very scary if you happen to be the one who put it there, but if you and two others are the only ones for miles and you keep coming across evidence that an unseen fourth person is leaving tell tale signs of their presence, then you may be a little unnerved. Again, it's the presence of what you don't know that scares you; not the presence of what you do know. What heightens the fear factory is the suggestion the movie originally intended by filming it as if it was a true story; the aspect that this movie was based on true incidents sure had me curious, but of course we all know now that that was the filmmaker's intent. The only things I find wrong with this movie are the slip-shod editing, the shaking cameras, the swearing and the endless droning on of some of the duologue, but in its execution, The Blair Witch Project really is one of the scariest films out there for serious horror fans and it will certainly go down as a milestone in true horror entertainment in the same way as Psycho and Night of The Living Dead !"

I hadn't seen a really scary movie that stuck with me for a long time, then I heard about this film. No monsters or slashers seen on screen, no moody music, no over abundant amount of gore. I thought to myself this must be some kind of experiment. Being a huge movie buff, I had heard everyone on the net and in magazines talk about how scary this film was for them. So I went to see The Blair Witch Project last night and I was right about the experiment part, this film is an experiment in total fear. The film is shot on what looks like mostly video and is very low budget. I believe however that you will be scared. The film is basically a premise played to the highest degree, a premise that never once let up, not even at the end. I've never really seen a film like this and I advise everyone out there who loves to be scared to go see The Blair Witch Project. The last shot of this film will be stuck in my head for years to come and for the first time in many years I slept with the light on. Can you face your fears?"
"TomServo-17","10","1","2","31 July 1999"," Wow!
","Nowadays good horror films are a dying breed. Fortunately, ""the Blair Witch Project"" came along just in time to renew my faith in horror films. The only thing that could have made this movie scarier was if it really was real. It certainly did look real. The performances were quite believable, which gives me the impression that the actors really were that scared. I don't quite know how to put into words just how good or scary this movie is. . .The review from the trailer that say ""the creepiest film since 'the Exorcist'!"" is quite an accurate one. . .In fact, if I may, I'd like to take it a step further and say that this movie is even scarier than ""the Exorcist"". Yes, you read right. This movie certainly is making me question my faith in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" as the best film ever made. I suppose I can't think of anything else to say about this movie. If you want a scare, you'll get it. If your in for a laugh...Well, you'll actually be able to get that too. Just not as much. Dare I say it (I hate phrases like this) but this is a ""must-see"" for a true horror fan."

","I think the ones who didn't like this film don't have any imagination or expected too much from it.It's my opinion that TBWP is absolutely the most original horror film of last 20 years.Released with few dollars and many ideas this movie is able to give you a sense of fear from first frame to the last,but only if you accept to be caught into the wood with the three poor students,in this case it's impossible to not be involved in their nightmare.The amazing idea of the movie is to erase every cliche'of horror films,avoiding to show monsters,or ""gore"" scenes,and the fear comes out from this ..Actually you never see what is really happening but you know that is the most horrible thing possible and the desperate screams of the girl are not easy to forget .This film is the fear of the dark,the fear of the darkest corner of our room into the night,it touches us deeply inside our most ancient fears..fear to be alone and helpless even in the society of mobiles and internet..,fear of the horrible witch that our grandmothers told to scare us And who cares if the whole story is invented ? it works! a scary movie must be scaring and this movie reach this target..after seen it I think you won't go for a picnic in the wood for a long time.."

"darkjosh","9","1","2","31 October 2000"," Groundbreaking horror film that was done-in by overhyping
","The Blair Witch Project is an inventive, often genuinely terrifying, and overall very effective documentary-like horror film about a group of student filmmakers who venture into the woods to explore the legend of the Blair Witch, which tells the story of a witch who lured children into her home and killed them.<br/><br/>So, how does Blair Witch, a film with a very meager budget and a cast of three unknowns succeed in delivering a scarefest? It very skillfully uses the documentary feel, its amateur camerawork, and its sense of reality to plunge the viewer into its deep, dank woods.  The audience doesn't feel as if they're watching another contrived slasher flick that's been churned out by some Hollywood gore factory to bring in profits: instead, what we feel is genuineness, reality, and uncertainty as the three students' sanity unravels in the depths of the unknown.<br/><br/>Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams all do exceptional jobs of showing their terror onscreen, especially during the nightly ritualistic assaults around their campground.  Donahue, however, is the best of the group, and her final apology certainly makes chills run up and down your spine when she breathes, ""I'm scared to close my eyes. I'm scared to open them.""  Blair Witch accomplishes a feat that has become almost extinct in horror films: it makes us care about its characters and also offers some truly terrifying moments. <br/><br/>When first released, there was so much hype regarding the fact that it was extremely unnerving and very scary - appetites whetted, audiences were expecting to see something totally mind-blowing, utterly terrifying, and completely overwhelming, but ultimately familiar horror film. They weren't prepared to never see any onscreen presence of evil, and when the film came to a close, many complained about its abruptness and what they viewed as an ultimately eventless, ""boring"" movie.<br/><br/>Blair Witch, however, is a thoroughly original, effective psychological mind trip that plays on the greatest fear we all have: the fear of the unknown. With little gore and no onscreen presence of the 'monster', we feel more of The Blair Witch Project than we watch it.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

The best thing about the movie is that is done in a Dogma style.<br/><br/>So it seems to be so real. Also it gives the movie a more atmospheric feel to it. And it does not show what the Blair witch is. For all we know it could be a tabby cat or a sadistic maniac killer wanting to kill fresh faced students.

","If you have read the other user comments for this film, you have noticed that people either love it, or they hate it.  There is a reason for this. There are two types of horror movies: There is the kind that tries to scare you by showing you something scary, and there is the kind which suggests something scary, but lets you imagine it yourself.  The people that hated Blair Witch were wanting scary images and blood and guts to be fed to them. That is not what they got.<br/><br/>Blair Witch sets out to scare you by forcing you to imagine something.  It lets your mind ""personalize"" what is really scaring you.  The people that don't like this movie must not understand this.  Either that, or they just don't care and they can't appreciate a horror movie which strays away from tradition.  Either way, they did not fully take in what this movie was offering to them.<br/><br/>If you are debating whether to watch/rent/buy this movie, you must first think about what really scares you.  Are you frightened by a scary monster jumping out and eating someone?  Or are you scared when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear something outside your window, letting your imagination create the most horrifying possibilities of what it is?  That is what The Blair Witch Project tries to do, and in my opinion, it succeeds entirely."

So it was the perfect atmosphere to see a scary movie.<br/><br/>I don't think I have ever experienced anything more terrifying, more perfectly horrific than the Blair Witch Project. It was not only the scariest movie I've ever seen, but the scariest event of my life (I admit I've led a somewhat tame life). It felt like a three-hour movie; if it had gone on one more scene I would have walked out, that's how intense it was. It is a very different movie, what with the first-person style and hand-held cameras and four-letter words. People either loved this movie immensely, or hated it with a passion. I loved it, it was very effective for me. I think if you watch it in your living room with a bunch of your friends it's not going to work. You have to be able to lose yourself in it. If you can do that, it'll take ten years of your life away. Years from now Blair Witch will be a cult classic, mark my words."

I ended up checking my watch to see how much time was left.  I ended up fast forwarding through much of it, and couldn't even tell what part of the guy they found in the shirt.  I kept hoping that the movie would get better, but it didn't.  The only parts that were half decent were the interviews with the old lady and the fishermen.  Unfortunately, these things were not built up on in the screenplay (oh, forgot, THERE WAS NO SCREENPLAY, could that have been why it was so boring?  No characters, no words other than those of the four letter variety, and absolutely no real scares.)  Frighteningly boring, especially for all the hype that surrounded it.  You never see the witch in the movie, and that was supposed to make it that much scarier. But like the witch, scary parts were never seen.  Hearing that girl yell ""F this"" and ""F that"" was so sickeningly annoying.  But maybe she's right... This movie does deserve an F, and an F minus if possible.  Don't waste your time."

"Dries Gevaert","9","1","2","20 July 2000"," This will psychologically kill you.
","Whow. Most horror movies don't scare me, mostly because you just get scared for one moment (like when someone's walking into a dark hallway and the killer jumps in front of him), and because those movies are very often just one big cliché. But this really scared the s**t out of me. This is not jumping in front of someone and stabbing him, this is psychologically killing someone. Here's how you do that: First, scare the victims with some weird voodoo stuff they'd rather don't want to have anything to do with. Then torture them by taking away something they really need, their sleep for example, scare them so hard they live the whole day in fear of the night. And ultimately, literally scare them to death by letting them now there's no escape. They'll surely gonna go totally insane, and maybe they might kill themselves. If they don't you'll do it.`<br/><br/>Finally an original concept in a movie, I haven't seen that for a long time. It's too bad that the geniuses who came up with this idea didn't get a bigger budget... Actually, it isn't, because being suck a low budget movie adds to the realism of this movie (it's supposed to be found footage so it's gotta be crappy). There's no other way of making this movie. It's great, and I think it's too bad that some people can't see that. They'll probably walk into the theater or the video store think they're gonna be amused (that's what most people think after 3 Screams, 2 Last Summers and dozens of other copies). But this is the type of movie that is made to crawl under your skin and eat you slowly from the inside out.<br/><br/>Another thing that those people probably didn't like is that you don't know half the story. EVERY Hollywood movie has a complete story with a beginning, an ending and stuff happening in the middle, and the viewer sees everything. This movie is in fact not a movie, as the makers try to tell you that it's just a bunch of found footage put together. And of course the camera's not always running, so there's no continuous story. Which leaves you with some big holes to fill after the movie. One solution is the website that caused the hype when the movie was in theaters and which made me go hire the movie. But it doesn't answer all of your questions, in fact it just adds to the mystery of the whole thing.<br/><br/>Acting. That would be nice in this movie, some people who could put down a credible personage (not someone famous, that would be real stupid, someone who is unknown and took acting classes). I think Heather is about the only one who really made me think that this was real (and that is what the movie is about, right?). Josh and Mikey overact most of the time. I noticed that if you watch the actors closely the movie seems less scary, probably because you see that they're just acting.<br/><br/>The atmosphere created by the people who made this (actors, editors, directors, marketing guys and webmasters) is great, it crawls under your skin and makes the movie scare the hell out of you. That atmosphere is what made this 100,000 $ movie a million dollar blockbuster. Since there was no directing at all (the directors just sent the actors in the woods with their equipment and the script), s****y acting in some scenes, some dumb things in the story (map, runaway) and an empty feeling at the end, I rate this movie a 9/10"
"nevrmore","9","1","2","20 July 1999"," This one scared the heck out of me!
","After having driven 2 hours to Chicago to catch the opening weekend of The Blair Witch Project', I would have to say it was time (and money) well spent.  It's also good to know that the movie was so well received that it cashed in over $1.5 million last weekend and only played at 27 theaters nationwide.  Of course, a lot of this has to do with all the hype and promotion that was done on TV and the Internet, but nothing can truly prepare you for this film.<br/><br/>I made it a point not to read the spoilers in order to heighten the experience.  The show was sold out and people cut off all conversation throughout the film.  You could tell everyone was engrossed in the film right from the start.  TBWP was actually quite funny in the first 30-40 minutes and everyone was laughing heartily.  Above the constant bickering between the students and abundant profanity, the movie never stopped building up.  Countless horror movies build up the tension, then throw in the old cat jumps out of the closet' routine on us.  This never happens with TBWP.  The film builds up right until the unnerving climax.  You really care about the 3 students and start to feel what they feel.  You get dragged down in the dread that they experience and you feel helpless because you know things are going to turn out bad.<br/><br/>We never get to see who or what is terrorizing these students, but that's the best part.  Fans of such fodder as Armageddon' and  The Rock' will no doubt hate this film because there isn't a big payoff.  One has to draw his/her own  conclusions about what really happened.  The unknown to me WAS the most terrifying aspect of this film.  There are 3 possible theories that I could come up with as far as what happened but we'll just never know. During the films' climax I heard many people make uncomfortable groans and shrieks and when the end credits rolled I heard many people exhale.  Heck, I think I might have been holding my breath also.<br/><br/>See this movie now!  Don't wait for it to come to video..."

You might not like it, especially if you were expecting the formula, but if you are looking for something fresh and creative AND very very scary, I can recommend this one highly.  The concept -- the actors actually filmed most of the footage since they are supposed to be making a documentary -- is brilliant.  I think some might under-estimate this film because it looks amateurish -- but that's why it works so well!  Afraid of the dark?  Half the film is black, threatening, night footage.

However, keep in mind that you're essentially watching a home movie of a camping trip gone horribly wrong.  Consequently, if it looked slick and professional, it would destroy the illusion.  Think of it as ""America's Scariest Camping Video"".<br/><br/>Nor will I deny that there are a few gaps in the storyline, especially regarding the various aspects of the Blair Witch legend.  But according to the premise, the filmmakers had barely started their project when they hiked into the woods to film a couple of remote sites associated with the legend. Consequently, when they get lost in the woods and odd things begin to happen, they don't have a clue what it means.  How can they tell us what they don't understand?<br/><br/>Further, this is primarily a suspense movie.  You spend most of the film waiting for something to happen.  However, in the meanwhile, you see the mental and emotional disintegration of these three filmmakers as they blame one another (and themselves) for their predicament.  But once again: it only works if you believe the premise.  My best friend didn't buy the premise, and he thinks this movie is a piece of crap.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This movie is not for everyone.  I strongly recommend that before seeing this movie, you visit the official website at http://www.blairwitch.com.

","Note:  This comment MAY contain spoilers, depending on your point of view. If you haven't seen TBWP, and don't know the background of the film, STOP reading NOW.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. Everybody and his brother (or sister, as the case may be) has made and reiterated their point about this film.  But the fact remains, that this low-budget wonder turned box-office hit is a scary movie.<br/><br/>Myself, I watched this movie at home, with all the lights turned off, and the volume turned up high.  I didn't watch it alone, however, and now I wish I did.  The main problem with my viewing of the film was that I had already heard all the hype, and as much as I tried to stay away from it, I knew most of the background of this film.  That is another thing I regret.<br/><br/>The fact is, I believe that if one views this movie as it was intended to be viewed, with no background knowledge, it will scare the daylights out of the viewer.  It is a classic terror film.  I know there are many who would disagree with me.<br/><br/>While I do not believe that this film can be ranked up with previous horror hits such as The Exorcist, the result was the same in many movie theaters in North America.  People complained of dizziness, nausea, and some had to leave the theater early because they couldn't take it any more.  The same thing happened with The Exorcist.  The symptoms from Blair were often the result of watching the shaky, multi-camera views, while The Exorcist was a blast of both imagery and sound that left the viewer reeling in his/her seat.  The result of the whole experience, agree with me or not on both counts, was terror.<br/><br/>There are those horror movie buffs out there, I'm sure, who complain that Blair was not classic horror, that the premise was faulty and the background was simply unbelievable.  Yet, I'm sure that these were people like me. They knew the background of the film, and were thus not affected as the writers, directors, and cast had originally intended.  I believe that if people saw this film as was meant to be, they would have been scared out of their wits.  I also think that many people, on examination of the film, downplayed how it made them feel.  In other words, the same people that say the film was terrible, probably sat in the theater and were scared themselves at some point during the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe that this is the most misunderstood movie in horror history.  If it had been viewed by the masses as it was originally intended, it would have scared the pants off almost anybody.  I know it scared me... even though I already knew what it was all about.  As I have said in the past, any movie that can make me think when it is over, is one that I enjoy. This movie will leave many questions in your mind, but as I said before, only if viewed as it was originally intended.<br/><br/>My Rating:  9/10"
"barfly99","6","1","2","30 May 2000"," Flawed but clever, and provokes amusing criticism
","TBWP has many flaws - the implausibility of some of the characters' behaviour, the irritation factor of watching people bicker for an hour, and so on. That said, it is an interesting little film with some clever touches (the interviewee's child covering her mother's mouth; the handprints in the house etc.). Scary? Not really, but then that couldn't be more subjective could it? THE EXORCIST had some people vomiting in the aisles yet it doesn't scare me at all (but the reverse could be true of another film). Anyway I personally I give TBWP six out of ten. What I find hilarious is the nature of the criticism this film has received since its release, which is almost as OTT as the hype that preceded it.<br/><br/>Most of those people who insist that is the worst film ever made are as one-eyed as those who said a year ago that it was the best. I notice that the early comments on the IMDb were nearly all hysterically complimentary, and now they're nearly all hysterically savage. There's nothing like a good bandwagon to jump on is there? (Or did the film suddenly metamorphosize from a classic to a turkey sometime last autumn?) This isn't the worst film ever made; there are countless worse (see the IMDb's own ""100 worst"" list for some prime examples). Harbouring unfettered resentment at the film-makers because you've seen an over-hyped movie is hardly a platform for objective criticism. If anyone had seen a film of this standard on late night TV and not cared for it they'd have turned it off and forgotten about it, and certainly not worked themselves into a frenzy about how awful it was. I particularly enjoyed reading the comments of those BWP-haters on here who remarked upon the ""suckers"" and ""idiots"" who actually watched it (can you spot something of an own goal here?).<br/><br/>The oft-repeated refrain that this film is ""cheap"" and ""amateurish"" beggars belief. Since it was made cheaply by then-amateurs, was hyped as a cheap film made by amateurs, and purports to be a cheap documentary made by amateurs, I would have thought its cheapness and amateurishness was rather to be expected. Given that the protagonists are supposed to be making little more than a home movie, the complaint about the jerky camera movements in this context is especially absurd - or would you have Heather & Co. set up dollies, cranes, and so on as they flee through the woods? If you've automatically got it in for this style of film-making (and you'd have to have been on Mars not to have known how TBWP was shot) why go and see it?<br/><br/>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has actually gone up in my estimation because it's reminded me of the power of movies to provoke the audience, and the public reaction to this film has been priceless. My absolute favourite comment I keep reading is ""I could have made this!"" Well since it cost next to nothing and those who made it are now multi-millionaires, why the f*** didn't you?"

","I went to see this film in DC this past weekend.  What a great experience! I think I personally overhyped the movie a little bit, but it was still an excellent movie.  During the movie I was not as scared as I had expected to be.  There were times that I gasped, closed my eyes, and felt my heart race, but somehow I expected more.  Word had it that people were running from the theatre screaming and getting sick at the showing before ours.  What I didn't expect though, was the very gradual sense of horror that grew in the hours after I left the movie theatre.  What I saw in the last few moments of screen time stayed with me, in a way I have never experienced before.  All in all, as an experience, this film did not scare me the way I thought it would, but it did creep and freak me out in a way I never imagined possible.<br/><br/>As to the film itself, the gritty, amature feel of the camera work was amazing!  The acting bowled me over as well.  This was an incredibly well made film in addition to being an experience unto itself.  Maybe I am being unrealistic, but this little film deserves recognition from the Academy."

","The Blair Witch Project is a definitive masterpiece of cinema.  It is refreshing to note that money, special effects and big names are no substitute for a good story, good acting and fantastic direction.  The suspense gradually builds and eventually seems to exude from the screen and grab you somewhere in the chest until the shear horror of the characters situation hits you.  The picture and sound quality are poor due to the financial restrictions of the project but they just serve to enhance the feeling of realism generated by some superb acting.  This may be a low budget effort but having seen it, I know for a fact that no amount of special effects or big name actors would have enhanced this movie.  I saw this film three weeks ago and I still cant get the ending out of my head, what a clever film this is and you must do it justice by viewing it in a dark room and on your own and leave the rest to your imagination."

So, although the story kept me attentive, the major part of the production was not ""ringing my bell"".<br/><br/>There was no gut and gore or shock, but the one sight of blood elicited more response than any ""shocker"" seen in recent years. The conclusion of the film was riveting and unforgettable.  This film is a must-see.  The story concept and execution are really inspired.  In a world of digital wham-bam, visual shock, and mutilation films, it was fascinating to me to watch a crowd body-pierced Goths walk out of the theater with stunned expressions.<br/><br/>It only proves what we film fans know within our hearts: A great campfire story always beats a poor movie."

","Before I saw this, I heard that this movie was supposed to be one of the scariest movies ever. So when I sat down with the movie, I was expecting a pretty scary movie.<br/><br/>I think the movie is very original with the actors running around with the camera themselves and with no music of any kind.<br/><br/>If I didn't know this was movie, I would have thought that this was real.<br/><br/>In many ways this is truly a very scary movie. It's not shocking like your average Scream or Elm Street movie, but every minute of the movie has a very eerie feeling about it.<br/><br/>It's just a shame, that some of the things in the movie is down right stupid. Firstly, if they lost the map, why didn't they just look at the filmed material where they actually filmed the map, it was clearly enough so you could navigate around with it. And throwing away the map was pretty stupid too, but that's a whole other thing.<br/><br/>Secondly, the witch's (or whatever it was) ""spell"" couldn't possibly reach the whole forest. At some point they (if they hadn't changed directions, and stopped all the time) would have been far enough away to avoid the spell and get out of the forest.<br/><br/>And another thing, it's pretty odd that Heather kept filming every time something scary was happening (like when the children attacked their tent). If I were attacked by something in the middle of the night I think I would do something else than film the whole damn thing. <br/><br/>But apart from that, I think that this was a great movie. I really sat on the edge of my seat at many points (which doesn't happen very often).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 8 out of 10"

","No film has scared me as much Blair Witch Project, and I doubt any film in the future will. It is everything you ask for in a horror movie; it's filled with fear from the very beginning, it gives you the feeling you are a part of the main characters in the film, it gives you that constant feeling that something is extremely wrong in these woods. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 10 is it's boring start, but this might also be a reason it's so creepy. Anyway I choose to give it 9 instead of 10 because I was bored the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>NB: I do not recommend anyone to see this film at the theater, watch it on a small TV in a cottage far up in the woods accompanied by your two closest friends only for the maximum horror experience."

The Blair Witch project actually still had me frightened when I went to sleep two days after I saw it for the first time.  It doesn't make you jump when you see it, it actually scares you for some time after seeing it. Which no slasher film has ever done for me.

"KayCee-8","10","1","2","20 March 2000"," If this doesn't scare you, no film will
","Few films manage to capture the starkly shattering fear of encountering that which is beyond human ken.  Of realising that once you step beyond the glow of the self-congratulatory campfire called human civilisation, you find yourself a shivering hominid a million years in the past confronting the Outer Dark, and all bets are off.<br/><br/>The impressively negative popular reaction to what, ironically, was an extremely popular film, says something about how comfortable, cynical, and amazingly unimaginative First-World humans really are nowadays.  We live in the age where a gun isn't scary until it's pointed directly at you, if even then...so asking people to remember how to use their imaginations is probably a lost cause.<br/><br/>But that's unfortunate, because _The Blair Witch Project_ is in a class by itself in the Horror genre, and deserves to scare people paranoid.  It's a work that translates the ""diary found in a cabin"" idea popular among writers like H.P. Lovecraft, to film.  It demonstrates amply, despite all the jaded critique, how quickly the human mind breaks down outside of reassuring frames of reference.  And it looks real.<br/><br/>This film cost me sleep, had me looking over my shoulder, distrusting curtains, groups of trees, and open dark doorways for days.  It scared me silly, and it still does.  Even writing this review scares me.  It's one of those films, like John Carpenter's _The Thing_, or Kubrick's _The Shining_, that gets scarier the more often one perceives it, and the more thought one puts into the dilemma.  If you're at all empathic, and if modern life hasn't dulled your sensitivity to the Unknown completely, you'll probably find this film disturbingly effective."

Oh, and best of all, the real twist is that the film will be shot using a tacky home video camera. Wow, the prospective film viewer is saying, this sounds awesome.  Well, sorry to dissapoint you folks who haven't seen this film yet, but this is the tackiest horror film ever.  There is no suspense.  There are no sudden frights that boost the viewers adreniline.  There are no memorable scenes. Nope, there's just a linear plotline, crappy film footage, annoying characters who we just couldn't care less about and not a scary thing in sight. When the film ends, quicker than most a might add, the initial feeling I was left with is 'Is that it?'.  There isn't even a bad 'thing' in this film. All we're treated to is a bunch of annoying characters running loco around a forest everytime they hear an insect crack a fart outside.  Avoid this film like the plague because you will only feel down afterwards for spending the two bucks to rent the damn thing in the first place."

","I first heard about this movie shortly after the Sundance film festival. It sounded intriguing and horribly frightening.  Boy, was it ever. I have never heard of such a movie before.  An entire film made up of ""lost"" footage shot by a camera crew making a documentary about a local legend.  The only draw back is that this movie was shot mostly in first person perspective and the camera was constantly in motion.  I was literally seasick by the end of the film.  It was a small price to pay to see such an original and emotional movie. It was obvious that there was very little scripting done for the actors.  The dialogue is so real that ""lines"" are dropped and words are occasionally slurred.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if this entire film was done on the first take.  This was a very short and effective route to a new level of realism. I did a great deal of research concerning this movie before it even hit theaters (I had been looking forward to seeing it since early this year) and was curious as to how the directors could possible end such a film. Although I won't spoil it for you I can tell you that the last 15 seconds of the Blair Witch Project will likely haunt you for many nights to come. This is a genuinely scary movie.  It accomplishes this without gore or cheap shocks.  The camera never actually shows the audience the danger the three characters are facing but it is a powerful presence that hides just off camera in every shot."

In fact, you don't get to see anything scarier that an out-of-focus shot of blood stained teeth, and sometimes the screen simply goes blank for half a minute leaving only sound. The horror of the movie is created within your mind. And that's why it runs deeper than any violent splatter movie could ever do.

Blair Witch is a refreshing change from all the bulls**t trash that we devour every year. A film doesn't necessarily have to have a $100 million+ budget and an arrangement of machine guns to be a masterpiece. Blair Witch plays with the mind psychologically. It isn't a case of when the 'scary' moments are ( I am referring to several comments that other people have posted) but what the it is and what it will do next. The beauty of it was how it was made and set out.

","This film is very clever indeed.  It gets into your head and if you don't stop it and come to your senses it can make you extremely terrified.  About half way through the film my heart rate was getting so fast I was struggling to breathe.  I had to remind myself that it wasn't real and that it's just a film!"

","WHOA, look at all those bad comments! Time for a change.<br/><br/>My brother took me to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" for my birthday and I was terrified. I already knew the ending though, so it didn't scare me as much as I had expected. But I was shaking when the credits rolled.<br/><br/>All anyone ever complains about is that this movie didn't live up to the hype and all that - well, the hype was half the fun! I saw the Blair Witch show on the SciFi Channel and I got so scared that I actually started to cry (at the time I thought it was all real).<br/><br/>Half the reason people say this movie is ""stupid"" is because they don't understand it (boy am I gonna get it for that one). They went into the theater expecting something like ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legends"" - you know, with a jump every minute & enough gore to make it an anatomy lesson. Instead, they got a great psychological thriller (*Oh no! A change in the typical horror movie pattern! I can't handle it!*).<br/><br/>I give ""The Blair Witch Project"" 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. Way to go Heather, Josh, & Mike! You guys ROCK!!"
"Ben-162","10","1","2","1 January 2000"," Prepare to be disturbed
","The Blair Witch is one of those rare occurances in cinema which manage to be much more than the sum of its parts.  A low budget film, shot by the actors on less-than-a-shoe-string managed to be one (after The Phantom Menace) of the most talked about films of the year. This film is not flawless, however. The arguments, although adding to the believability of the characters, do tend to grate after the first hour.  The loosing of the map incident seemed a very unlikely occurence considering the circumstances.  The main flaw however has to be the fact that filming is not a natural human response to extreme psycological trauma, and, although the film would be lacking somewhat if during moments of terror the camera was shut off, it would make more sense.  The ending it a major example of this which verges on the unbeleivable, even if one beleives that it is a way for the characters to psycologically distance themselves from their reality.<br/><br/>
However, on the whole, the good points outweigh the bad.  The level of emmersion is unsurpassed - there has seldom been a film that (figurativly speaking, of course) skewers you, puts you in its mouth, chews thoughtfully and finally spits you out as well as this one - leaving you only with haunting images that stay with you for weeks, and the silent promise not to go camping again.  It deftly sidesteps the ironical slasher movie formula, and delivers its message not through flashy script or ""cheap"" shock tactics, but by getting inside your head and whispering; and by giving you icons and symbols (such as the wood itself - which it taken as a symbol life, and then stripped of it (like the children themselves) - no birds sing, no leaves grow.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch is a fantastic movie, but, the fact that it is more disturbing than scary, means that the audience has to be able to let the Blair Witch work its voodoo without putting the brain onto automatic and expecting to be entertained; you are, unfortunatly (although it is a rarity in modern Cinema) required to watch it on a deeper level."
"zinemani","10","1","2","4 January 2000"," The best horror movie in the 90's...or is it ever?
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a thruly amazing film, an effective machine of horror and despair, that, if you're willing to (because if you're not, it just doesn't work), it will disturb you. Great cast, specially the female lead (whose ""I'm so sorry"" sequence is unforgettable) and very expert and inteligent construction of fear. Final ten minutes are hell on earth, specially the ending bit where... Along with ""Texas Chain Shaw Massacre"" and ""John Carpenter's Halloween"", ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a must. Unfortunatly, it will be seen by too many people because of the publicity, and it will be stupidly hated, parodied, clones, imitated and...sequeled. No matter what people say to you, rent it or buy it (on DVD, because of the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary), see it alone, in the dark, in late night, and willing to enjoy it. It is worth it. If you've already seen it...just see it again!"
"vbz","10","1","2","28 December 1999"," Groundbreaking Film mortally hurt by excessive hype
","A spit in every major Hollywood studio's face, to say the least, and the second film this summer to learn a lesson from MTV's atrocious programming and put it to superior, even revolutionary use. With ""Run Lola Run"" it was the relentless pace and non-dependence on dialogue which created a sublime effect, a near return to the silent era. ""Blair Witch"" took the channel's utterly false reality of home-video footage and documentary-style acting, transforming it into perhaps the most realistic falseness to ever grace the silver screen. The enormous buzz that surrounds this amazing horror movie (which never aspires to be more than a cheeky genre entry) has already started an undeserved yet equally strong backlash, mostly by jealous film-students at first, then by the spoiled masses which could not comprehend anything beyond Will Smith's special effects-ridden vehicles. Misunderstood both by the critics who hailed it as the next cineamtic movement and the audiences bombasted by the hype, ""Blair Witch"" should be taken at face value; although currently that is practically impossible to do. The degree of scariness in the exploits of three young idiots (types all too familliar to everyone who attended college) doomed to perish in the haunted Maryland woods will largely correspond to one's own level of sensitivity, but regardless of how frightened the film makes you, it amounts to an experience of gleeful delight,(akin to the great ""Evil Dead"" series minus the cartoonish gore), of taking part in something new and refreshing. Of course the overall execution is not totally original, deriving mainly from ""The Real World"" and an obscure 80's Vietnam flick called ""84 Charlie Mopic"", but what does it matter? Nothing, repeat NOTHING spurts out of the blue - (a classic case in point would be Tarantino inspired by Goddard and Melville inspired by Carol Reed and John Huston inspired by the 20's expressionist cinema and ""Public Enemy""). ""Blair Witch"", while not transcending its genre, still has a share of pure visual artistry, some probably unintentional. A certain beauty lies in the shots of Heather Donahue's white shape jetting through the dark forest, the ominous rays of sun glittering in the evening trees. The amateur feel the directors generate is but an expertly-crafted illusion and therein lies the film's ultimate pleasure."

I saw people leave with full bags of popcorn because they were so engrossed that they forgot where they where and what they were doing.  I saw someone throw-up, (don't sit in the front row or you may face motion-sickness too).  My friends said they had to take sleeping agents the night they saw it just to get to bed.

The Blair Witch Project is a horrifying exercise in the psychology of fear that, if there is any justice in the world, will be recognized fifty years from now as a classic film. It's not just a great HORROR movie, either; it's a great MOVIE period, the first truly imaginative and original one this Oscar year.  In a righteous world, a shoe-in Best Picture nominee; in any world, the most insanely daring and worthwhile piece of celluloid to come down the pike in a long time.

","After watching this for the first time I was left slightly disappointed mainly  because of the uniqueness of the movie, low budget and filming. I decided to watch it a second time uninterrupted and realized the horror that the makers tried to portray to the viewer. It really touched my senses and the movie brought to me the very elements that scare me in my own nightmares. The things that you can't see but , rather, implied have a greater effect upon your senses than those that you can! Perhaps those who had a vehement dislike to the movie should view it a second time uninterrupted just as I did. I am too scared to watch it a third time at the moment as the aura of the movie still haunt me. If watching it a second time doesn't affect you then, this is not the movie for you. Perhaps you should view movies like the Toxic Avenger etc, where blood and carnage are not left to the imagination."

The way the movie was shot, gives you a sense of ""Help!  I'm lost in the woods with these guys!""  Heather was just great. You could see the fear in her eyes and feel it in her breath.  What a movie it would be if she were to tandem in another horror alongside Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense fame!!"

","Like most people now, I think I have become jaded to just about everything in movies.  Violence, sex, the monster popping up at an unexpected moment, it's all been done before.  The Blair Witch Project has none of that, and has only one scene that shows blood, but it is still the scariest film I have seen in over 10 years.  I don't know if I agree that it is the scariest movie of all time, as I can think of some notable exceptions that still get to me today, but it defintely ranks up there with films such as The Haunting, Night of the Living Dead, and The Exorcist.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has seen it, but I will say that at no time do you believe the people in the film are simply acting, and the power of suggestion, not the power of visuals, work to unsettle and frighten the watcher. Definitely go see this one in the theater, if you like to be scared, you will not be disappointed."

Most horror movies make their mark depending on the realism. Jaws, one of the best and top grossing horror movies ever, hits the reality factor pretty hard as most people believe it could happen. The Blair Witch Project seemed extremely real. The actors were very convincing and the filming was incredible. The movie builds and builds and the characters grow more agitated and fearful of the situation. It is a must see!!!"

","Its clear that opinion is divided on this film. Another reviewer has referred to the importance of the viewer's imagination in enjoying this film. I think this is the key. The film works on a psychological level which few other films get close to. I think those who have not enjoyed it might have been expecting the usual serving of special effects, a menacing soundtrack and slick editing. There is also that group of horror fans who approach each film as if it was some macho challenge where they are determined not to get scared. The Blair Witch Project is amazing because it does not relay on the usual ingredients but still manages to deliver. I watched this in a plush cinema with a group of friends, however, I think it would work even better if I'd seen it at home with no one else in the house. I would urge anyone with an open mind and a reasonable imagination to see the Blair Witch Project. However, if you like all the work done for you wait for Halloween 10."

The actors (specially Heather) are great, and could become big time stars. Most people around me didn't like it, because they were expecting a straight horror film. I predict that the scene when Heather tapes her eyes (one of the last ones) it's just a jewel... two thumbs up!, and I predict it'll become a classic movie flick."

"EdgarST","6","1","2","25 November 1999"," A Treat for Film Students
","There is nothing worse than watching a movie with film students. They not only complain about technical aspects, but they usually think of the way they would have shot the same script. For four years working at the Havana Film and Television School, I went through this, and I suppose I caught some of their ""disease."" The consequences of this ""film alphabetization"" came to the forum while watching ""The Blair Witch Project."" I remembered the students' approval of something good, as well as their loud reactions, their laughter and booing. At the same time I was questioning the film during the whole projection. This does not mean I did not find it an interesting film experience (I saw it in a theater, and I was the only customer). Quite the contrary: it is an original cinematic concept, an intelligent reflection on fear, and a good definition of horror as nothing but a state of mind, related to ignorance and darkness. However in too many occasions more than I can remember right now-- the situations were barely credible on technical and dramatic grounds: for example, would you believe someone lost in the woods (Heather) would keep on taping images while discovering that another person (Mike) has thrown their only connection to civilization --a map-- to the river? Well, Heather shouts at Mike like hell but she never stops gazing through the visor of her video camera! She is one of the most obnoxious characters ever to appear on a film (see during the first part, how she does not let her interviewees finish their sentences), not only for her bully ways but also for her obsessive recording of a ""documentary."" She is not a filmmaker; she is just a student working on a project, because of which her life is in danger. Before the resolution, there is a brief moment when Heather and Mike are alone in the darkness, inside the tent, when it seems improbable that the recorder would be registering sounds. And on top of that, we are not told that this is the edited and Dolby version of the found footage, a fact that predisposes the ""film alphabetized"" viewer to distance himself/herself from the film, and smile at the naïve opening title. But it is a remarkable film nonetheless, although the overrating affects the objective appreciation of the filmmakers' good work."
"eewittme","8","1","2","19 July 1999"," Ignorance is bliss
","The fact that I knew quite a bit about this film going in spoiled it a bit for me, though I can still recognize its genius. Hopefully films like this will send a message to Hollywood that they don't need to pour tons of money into goofy special effects to scare a modern audience. This film proves something many of us knew as little kids but have since forgotten: The things you can't see scare you the most.<br/><br/>Go see it. Stop reading these reviews."

","I´ve seen this movie dubbed ""the scariest movie of the 90´s"", and I must say they´re wrong. This is THE scariest movie of them ALL! It starts slowly and thus fooling you to think it´s not so scary after all. Gradually it becomes more and more horrifying until you just can´t take it anymore! By the time the final shot comes and the movie releases you from it´s grasp you´re left with heart pounding, shocked to your core. The final shot keeps returning to your mind for days. It´s amazing how something so simple can be so overwhelmingly terrifying... How have they managed to come up with a movie this good with almost non-existent budget, unknown actors and simple script? The answer lies in many things, but most importantly in the actors and the style this movie was made. Together they create an experience which is totally convincing. Always before you could see the actors are faking it all and this and that was made by effects, film-editing etc. The documentary style guarantees the situations are portrayed realistically and all three actors seem like they aren´t acting at all, just as if they were really living it all. I would like to recommend an oscar for everybody responsible for this movie, it´s really that good and groundbreaking."

","I liked this film, I liked it because it was different. It was a fairly original concept which is hard to come by these days. It also broke new ground by using marketing to it's full, I think more films will use the internet in future the way Blair Witch did. And why not? I doubt any other film could make the amount of profit which Blair Witch did but then again most films aren't made for the cost of a family car. It possibly suffered slightly from over hype but this didn't deter me from seeing it. I left this movie feeling sick, because I had eaten a big bag of skittles and a bag of popcorn and the camera work was incredibly shaky. I don't normally get motion sickness but this came close.

","Got to see the prelim release of this at the Mayan theater in Denver on Friday night, and it became apparent to me that so many people missed the point of the movie by the number of people who were booing at the end.  It seems so many people have to see a monster or have something jump out of the darkness to think a horror movie is good.  If you're going with that idea in mind, you will be sorely disappointed.  This isn't the kind of movie that really scares you when you watch it, but comes back to haunt you the next time you find yourself alone in the dark.  Instead of showing a monster, you spend the whole movie imagining what it could be, and that constant imagining will stay with you long after you see it, scaring you each time you try to ponder what it might have been.  I can honestly say that with the notable exception of ""Seven"", this is the only horror movie that's ever managed to scare me out of my mind..."
"Seamus-25","10","1","2","4 November 1999"," Truly the scariest film I have ever seen
","This, is the scariest film I have ever seen. The basic story deals with 3 students investigating an old legend. When something strange begins to happend we witness a slow disintegration of the characters as they try to deal with what is happening to them. I felt I would behave in exactly the same way as the characters in the film and this allowed me to be drawn into the story. This film does not have any soundtrack or traditional camera trickery used in typical movies. If you go in expecting The Exorcist you will be disappointed, but if you are prepared to forget that the story is not true and allow yourself to be drawn in then you begin to experience the terror I felt while watching this film.<br/><br/>I don't think it will stand up to too many repeated viewings as the film relies on suspense, more so than most films, and an element of that is always lost when you know what is going to happen."

These were 3 of the stupidest people I've ever seen in real life or on screen and, since they were playing themselves, I can only assume that they're not particularly bright in real life.  In conclusion, the concept could have worked.  The product, thanks to the dummies, didn't."
"RobT-2","9","1","2","3 November 1999"," The filmmakers refuse to pay their dues...
","...so we, the viewers, have to pay them instead.  That, I think, lies at the heart of the many chants of ""worst movie ever made"" from BWP's detractors. It's also one of the reasons the film will stay in the heads of its fans for days, and why those fans won't shut up about it.<br/><br/>The problem is that not everyone is used to art which doesn't readily explain itself, which makes the viewer work at interpreting it.  Two practitioners of this type of art in other fields are the writer William S. Burroughs and the composer John Cage.  Some famous movies which do the same kind of thing are ""L'Avventura"", ""Last Year at Marienbad"", ""8 1/2"", and ""Blow-Up"".  Some people can't stand these films, others can't live without them.  What they have in common with BWP is that they put the viewers' minds to work, filling in the deliberate gaps in the plot and unexplained areas. While a lot of people dote on films like this that ""make them think"", others don't appreciate being put to work when they've come to be entertained.<br/><br/>A better precedent for BWP is ""David Holzman's Diary"", which purports to be a young filmmaker's attempt to turn his life into a film (and which also aroused strong negative reactions from viewers who felt cheated by its not being ""real"").  Some have asked why the students kept filming after losing all control over events.  The answer is that, like David Holzman, they found the act of recording their experience on film was the only way to impose order and meaning upon the experience.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock, I think, said something to the effect that drama was just real life ""with all the dull parts removed.""  BWP does have some admittedly dull parts, and its detractors have seized upon these as proof of its badness.  Others have cited the repetitive dialogue, and the arguments that run in as many circles as the students themselves.  One could also argue, though, that these devices enhance the veracity of the film (at least on an emotional level--we all know it's not ""real"", right?).  Along with the fact that almost all the shots are point-of-view, they give the impression of actually being inside the film while it's happening.  This is another reason the film arouses so much enthusiasm.<br/><br/>While remarkable in its own way, too much has been made of BWP's Web-driven publicity campaign.  If anything, the hype might have been too effective, in that it attracted (along with the curious film intellectuals) a number of people unsympathetic to this type of film.  On the bright side, it seems to have swept in quite a few people who, without knowing it, have been waiting all their lives to see something like this.  This is the kind of fan most likely to declare BWP their all-time favorite film, the best horror film since ""The Exorcist"", etc.  One hopes they will get equal enjoyment out of Burroughs, Cage, and ""L'Avventura""!<br/><br/>For my part, I admit I don't see many regular horror films (though in retrospect I'm reminded that many landmarks of the genre, including ""Cat People"", ""Psycho"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" were also made on low budgets, if not micro-budgets), but do enjoy art that makes the viewer work a little.  I enjoyed BWP for all the reasons listed above, along with several images and sequences I expect to stay with me a long time.  Like a dog trying to get the last bit of meat off a bone, my mind keeps worrying at these scenes, trying to impose meaning on it all.<br/><br/>This reminds me of how a conventionally-trained classical violinist tried out an avant-garde piece by Charles Ives and hated it, saying that if you swallowed something that disagreed with you, you could take something to get rid of it, but that he (the violinist) couldn't get these awful sounds out of his ears.  I wonder if some of the negative reactions to BWP might come from people unwillingly carrying it in their heads for days, weeks, maybe even months.<br/><br/>BWP isn't my favorite film of all time, but I prefer it to all the other films I've seen so far this year.  I can imagine seeing better films this year, but the filmmakers are going to have to work a little to please me. (Heh, heh.)"

"modaman","10","1","2","17 July 1999"," Review and Possible Goof in the Blair Witch Project?
","I am glad to finally see a horror movie come along that's actually scary. It doesn't seem like much to ask of a horror movie, but it's certainly not something that any degree of multi-million dollar budget CGI effects can seem to deliver. When I was a child, the scariest movies, to me, were the ones that my parents wouldn't let me finish. Where what the television screen could show me left off, my creative mind took over, in the darkness of my bedroom. As the Blair Witch Project demonstrates with such chilling results, it's often what you can't see, what you don't know that scares you. I applaud the creators of this film for taking me back to those long nights in my dark bedroom for just a little while. Now, something for the ""Goofs"" section- maybe, I'm not sure. This movie was supposed to take place in October, and in Maryland- I'm not sure when it was filmed, but it looked like fall, and I read in an interview w/the lead actress that they slept through 35-degree nights. How is it then, that you hear a cicada's call during one of the scenes? On the east coast, everywhere north of the Virginia's, cicada's are all gone by early to mid September. I don't know. It's probably nothing."

The shaky camera work (yes, I realize it was intended to be that way) and the quick movements of the camera made me wish I were drinking Pepto Bismol rather than soda. But after I came home and curled up in bed that night, my mind started wandering and the film content started to bother me. If a film keeps me up all night, it means it's a good one. I appreciated its artistry much more upon watching it a second time."

Nothing I could have done would have prepared me for what I saw.<br/><br/>This movie was brilliantly done, doing exactly what it meant to, which was scaring the bejeezus out of every single person in the theater in Houston. It did it possibly too well.  I think it may have gone beyond the line of ""fun scary"" to ""I- don't-know-if-I-can-handle-this scary"".<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film, but I give a VERY SERIOUS warning.  If you're not really into horror, or don't like being scared, you probably ought to let someone else go for you.  Your pants will be wet and you won't sleep, otherwise."
"Budd-5","9","1","2","29 October 1999"," A gem
","The directors of the Blair Witch Project possess a directing tool that most horror directors (and most cinema patrons these days) lack: patience. Most horror movies have a scare at the beginning that unsettle the audience. We see a glimpse of the murderer; we get an unsurprising shock; some famous actor gets killed off. We are then forced to sit through a number of requisite shocks before the unoriginal conclusion.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project opens with a smiling cast and a happy village. It delays its scares; instead it builds up the tension. What the directors are aiming to do is build up the tension to an extreme and then scare the pants off the audience by the finale. It works miraculously.<br/><br/>The three actors are enormously effective. Heather Donahue possibly the standout. They are not only acting but they are filming the entire footage and though their camerawork is shaky, the same cannot be said for the actors. We're told that they ad-libbed every line, well if that's the case they are not only wonderful actors, they are quite competent in the writing department. Heather's confession; Josh guilt-tripping Heather and Michael's slow but affecting character build up is tremendously effective.<br/><br/>But this is the director's show. They have said publicly that they were the Blair Witch. Though they never touched the cameras, they focused the storyline onto its gripping end.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the reaction leaving the cinema. Most people didn't like it. If you're expecting a shock a minute you will be disappointed but this is a gem of a film. I loved every second especially the kiss-off. I'm writing this review 4 hours later and my heart is still pounding."
"Locdog07","10","1","2","27 October 1999"," Brilliant and much more than meets the eye
","A lot of people who do badmouth this film haven't done any real research into the movie's background. It's just not enough to watch the movie in a theather and blocking your mind off from whatever happens on the screen so you can walk out and say ""That wasn't scary"". The whole point of the film is to be scared, it's a horror, so why not let it happen? A lot of these people might have actually been scared but not realized it. But I'm speculating.<br/><br/>The film itself is incredible, a work of genius. It's inspired so many people to argue and debate over what actually happened to these three students, even though by now we all know it was fake. Those people who say ""It's dumb cause it wasn't real"", are they actually saying they wanted to see three students hunted down a probably murdered? So much effort went into making this film possible, some of which even came from the fans themself before the film was even released. I've done a lot of research into the film's background and secrets that I can't help but love it, and there are so many people who limit themselves to simply watching the film with a stone mind and not letting any of the imagination the movie creates seep into their brain.<br/><br/>My second favorite film of all time, it will always be a classic to me.

"DButcher","9","1","2","27 October 1999"," Psychological Time-bomb
","I went into The Blair Witch Project expecting the ""SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!"" And as I sat there, I found the movie enjoyable, somewhat suspenseful, interesting, but far from being the ""SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!"" That was, until the final scene. If you are paying attention to the movie, the final scene's resonnance is absolutely powerful. I made the mistake of going to the film, based on seeing ONE, I repeat ONE movie trailer, so I am not some cynnic jaded by the hype. My reaction was visceral. My body temperature dropped by a good 20 degrees and I was paranoid for a week. I believe that if people who dismiss the the film had watched it with an open mind, they would have found it as disturbing as those who enjoy the movie did. It is more a psychological time bomb than a film. I will be the first to admit that the film was not a constant terror-filled joy-ride through the darkness of our minds. But I could not imagine any other film that has finished with such a disturbing and thought provoking ending that treats the film-goer with the respect of not force-feeding everything to you. Oh by the way, saw the Sixth Sense a week later, and realized there is an upside to production values."
"alice liddell","9","1","2","27 October 1999"," A modern masterpiece: Blair's brilliance as much about filmmaking as terror. (possible spoilers)
","True story 1: When I was ten, I had a huge row with my mother, and hid out by dark in the local ramparts for six hours.  I was so traumatised, I didn't go out again for nearly a year.  True story 2: a couple of years later, out in the woods with some friends, we were shot at by the farmer on whose land we were trespassing.  They may have been fake bullets, but we didn't know that then.  True story 3: last June I was diagnosed for a cancerous tumour. It was treated successfully, but I was convinced I was going to die, and I'm only in my early twenties.  True story 4: Two days before I saw THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, I took my dogs out for a walk at midnight. I normally go with my wife, but she was tired.  I don't know the area at all, and after a few minutes I was lost.  It was foggy, with unlocatable voices everywhere, and I kept returning, with increasing panic, to the same place.  This lasted about an hour, the longest of my life.  No wonder BLAIR scared the living bejasus out of me.<br/><br/>Why, you may ask, is a total stranger telling me all this?  Well, I've been trying to work out why a film everybody else considered boring or disappointing, truly, deeply terrified me into a dripping cold sweat, gauntly pale face, shaking, wrenching my fingernails.  A film about uncovering the past has made me reappraise my own.  Every day when I was in college, today in the streets, posters for Missing Persons, some missing for over six years.  A young neighbour of mine a couple of years ago went on holiday with some friends and mysteriously drowned.  I remember as a baby my dad would pretend to throw me off the ferry.  Richie Edwards.  I had never really given any of these events much thought.  I can't stop now.<br/><br/>I wrote the above last night about 20 minutes after seeing the film.  I'm a lot less hysterical now.  Like Heather, I will take relative comfort in hiding behind the camera.  Because the film is as much an investigation into filmmaking as it is an exercise in terror.  It reveals the terrible fears behind the 'home' in home movie.  It uses modern critical theorisation undermining the 'objectivity' and 'realism' of documentaries, by showing subjectivity pouring into its form with a vengeance.<br/><br/>BLAIR is obsessed with the nature of filmmaking.  Barely a scene goes by without some reference to the camera.  Some of this is rather obvious - e.g. the shots of the cameraperson in the mirror, or other camerapersons - but much of it is brilliant.  In films, even in fiction, we are used to the camera being our detached guide to everything we see - watching it fail so badly, so rigorously, helplessly under attack is terrifying, which is why I think the film affects film buffs more than others - BLAIR is nothing less than an attack on the presumptions of the medium.  The camera is as much a source of the fear as the unknown, as light reflected off the lens creates eerie, ghostly images.<br/><br/>Even what seemed to be flaws add to the terror.  The continued attention drawn to the camera seemed contrived, but we needed it on for the film to continue.  Through the camera we become sadistically party to the threesome's pains - we dread them turning it off.  We are the watchers as much as whatever's out there.  The perfect editing beggared belief, until you begin to ask who actually edited this?  When Mike falls near the end, and Heather can be heard screaming in the distance, the camera moves again, and it's not Heather.  Who is it?  Mike said the witch models were too creative for rednecks.  Isn't the implication horrifying?  The well-documented manner of the film's creation actually increases the terror - the confusion over fixed authoriality mirrors the characters' bewilderment at who is the author in the film of the horrors.<br/><br/>As in most horror films, there seems to be a fundamental misogyny at play. As Heather herself notes, the Blair Witch project was her project.  She is the Blair Witch.  She takes two ordinary middle class guys out of their American homes, and subjects them to the most ghastly horrors.  She controls every aspect of what they do>.  Another reason for the panic, though, is the complete absence of sex.  Only Josh refers to a partner, and he's the first to disappear. These are characters lost in the woods - that ancient metaphor for sexuality, especially female - and the subject never comes up.  Yeah right.  The camera never lies.<br/><br/>But, most importantly, this is a basically terrifying film.  Three people, around my, and most of the audience's age, lost, without bearings, the reassuring signifiers of modern life, in a wilderness with threats both supernatural and primitive.  It's not quite as mysterious as PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK - we do know there's something out there - but for a $150m+ film to deny explanations or closure is remarkable.  The scene where Josh and Heather are suddenly awake, running after something in the distance, is probably the scariest thing I've ever seen in a movie, although the ending comes close.  The film begins with the characters leaving home and ends with them finding one.  Having been reduced to the most basic drives of humanity, parentless, lost, the pair rediscover childhood, in the form of bloody handprints.  I don't even want to think about that one right now.  Grrrgh. You probably won't want to see this movie - it's a different kind of scary."

","(Warning first paragraph may spoil - see the film before reading ANY reviews)<br/><br/>OK so they should have followed the river downstream (note to film-makers - rivers sometimes go underground). But some of the criticisms thrown at this new-era defining movie are ridiculous. They didn't take a mobile phone - what into the deep woods where it wouldn't work? They didn't have a GPS system - 3 students in 1994? Surprise surprise, they didn't have a helicopter or Scotty's transporter either. They went south for 12 hours and ended up in a circle Â– it's difficult enough following a straight line in the dessert, let alone a wood.<br/><br/>Suffice to say if you go expecting the likes of Freddie or Scream you will be disappointed, move on to the next multi-million dollar gore fest, predictable, safe and utterly tedious. This film leaks atmosphere, it enthralled the audience I was with - leading to a spontaneous round of applause at the end. Perhaps at first glance it does not sound or look that original, but the dialogue feels real (yes students do swear), the hi-8 footage draws the viewer into believing (or at least suspending disbelief), the never-quite seeing the horror leaves you questioning what is out there. This film is not about blood and guts or special effects; it is about a deep unease with the unknown, fear and ultimately, terror."

","I went into the theater with high expectations, I read many reviews of this movie and I was really expecting to be blown away by it. The reaction that I had was not of being blown away but a sense of fear that I had really not felt ever in a movie theater. The film is being described as one of the scariest ever made, and I have to agree! I dont think that it belongs to the traditional horror movie genre, the fear that the filmakers achieve here is not cinematic, it is real, as if we are experiencing what the characters are. I felt like I was living their dilema. I felt nervous from the moment they arrived in the woods. This is the type of movie you experience not watch. Im sure that people are going to analyze this film for years, I honestly believe that there is nothing to analyse, this movie taps into our basic fears. there is one scene in the film that literally is heart-wrenching. People will disect this movie, they will talk about technique and theorise about the filmakers intentions. I believe that their single intention was to scare the audience silly!

It is so sad that great directors like Dario Argento can't even get a theatrical release of one of his films and this can make millions. This is a perfect example of what is wrong with entertainment in America. It is no longer about art it is all about hype.

I am a huge fan of independent film but this is something I could have done on a camping trip in two days with a $50 budget.

The Blair Witch Project is not a film for selfish people who just want to sit there and see a lot of special effects and people dying to feel terror, This is a totally empathic film, you have to get on the shoes of Heather, Mike and Josh to know what they're feeling, to feel the horror of the situation. Its a movie of everyones deepest fears, its about what terrify us, its about getting inside the Blair forest and share the desperation with Heather, Mike and Josh.  And let me tell you if you're willing to get inside this movie you will be scared as hell!!!.  The camera work it's essential to make you feel like you're watching your own video, something that could happen to you.  It's not about if the story is real or not, that has no importance couse The Blair Witch Project is not scary because of what you know, but of what you dont know, what you dont see, what you feel but can't explain. The witch is as real as our fears, and that's the greatness of the story.  I consider myself a horror films fan and I can say I have seen a lot of them, and believe me as I got deeper on the plot of the Blair Witch Project I started to feel this creepy feeling on the bottom of my stomach, that we horror fans love to feel but can't feel  to often. As I said before this is not a movie for everyone couse it's not a movie to see from the outside but from the inside, and believe me if you get inside it, this is truly one of the must terrifying films ever made!! This is one of those films you know its going to become a classic, and it surely deserves it."

","Prior to seeing this flick for the first time, Scream was my favourite horror movie.  Now, don't get me wrong, I still love Scream (sequel sucked in a big way - still lookin' forward to 3 though) but with Blair Witch I came to realise the way in which the previously (in my eyes anyway) infallible Scream failed.  Despite the sexy, beautiful girls and cool guys, despite the witty, fun pop culture refs, despite the neat little murder mystery, Scream still spoon-fed the audience, albeit in a more interesting way.  The opening scene with Drew was and always will be an awesome piece of cinema, but at the end of the day, there's a psycho, with a knife, wanting to kill a pretty girl - it's something we've all seen countless times before and if you're a hardened horror fan like myself, something you kinda grow numb to.  It doesn't really have any effect, or at least not the effect the director wants it to have.<br/><br/>Blair Witch treats the audience like a sadistic little kid to his younger sister.  He wants to scare her, he loves getting a rise out of her, he knows what buttons to push.  TBWP invites you on a trip where our everyday common fears come into play - most people were at one point of their life or another scared of the dark, or at least wary, some still are.  The horror accelerates in a painfully real way, where we are at first allowed to know the characters and can easily view them as real people, none of them remotely conforming to any movie stereotype, each with faults and shading - we can relate to them and when the **** hits the fan, we feel all the more for them, thus the fear we will feel becomes far more palpable and painful than Scream could ever hope to achieve.<br/><br/>I've noticed how, on the IMDB Blair Witch voting page, 10 is, of course the most popular mark, while 1 is the second most.  What can I say, people still need to be spoon-fed, like little babies.  They bitch about how there's no blood or monsters to be seen, how there's too much shaky camera or about the swearing, the arguments.  To these people I say ""feel free to use your brain once in a while - that's what it's there for.""  Oh yeah, and go watch The Haunting."

","I can see why many people may have been disappointed by this film. People go into a movie these days expecting sooo much. They want special effects, music, predictable plots etc...Blair Witch has none of this, and that's GREAT!! For once, a different kind of movie. Even after the horrible criticism I heard of this, I watched it on DVD tonight, with my girlfriend and all the lights out-with the inclination we would not like it nor be ""scared""...and it scared us both unbelievably. I have never been that scared from a film I will admit. The key is to step into the movie, which they make so easy to do. And I dont care what any tough guy writes, you would be scared sh*tless if you were in that situation. Also, watching the new prelude they have for this (on DVD or rental)helps build the premise and suspense. Excellent job to the makers of this, and I hope they get their cut of the cash."
"BTM-2","10","1","2","19 October 1999"," An incredible,original horror film
","Never has there been such an original piece of work as The Blair Witch Project. The creators really put forth much time and effort to create an atmosphere that seems believable,what with the newscasts,interviews,photographic evidence,and the Blair Witch website. Finally the film itself is a masterful achievement. Kudos must go to the trio of Heather,Joshua,and Michael. They performed incredibly well,apparently ad-libbing their way throughout the entire picture. The ending scene was just creepy. An excellent horror film that should not be missed. <br/><br/>    Three out of four stars"
"Scain","9","1","2","18 July 1999"," Read my lips: don't go camping
","I first heard about the Blair Witch Project a few months ago while looking at upcoming summer movies.  I read every article I could get my hands on.  I logged hours on www.blairwitch.com reading the (albeit falsified) history of the Blair Witch.  Now that the movie has come, I must say that it is even more frightening that I had expected.  <br/><br/>The 80-something minute film is incredibly convincing, realistically acted, and truly terrifying (and even hilarious at parts).  It relies not on gore or escaped serial killers, but rather simple symbols like piles of rocks or a stick man hanging from a tree.  Everything in this movie works, from the characters to the jerky, low-end cameras (which immerse you even more, being a first-person point of view).  It sucks you in and doesn't release you until the last frame goes to black.<br/><br/>Trust me, you will sleep with the lights on."
"TeaBunny","10","1","2","13 October 1999"," one of the best horror films of all time
","~spoilers~ Reasons why this movie is in my Top Five? The autumn woods, complete blackness, children laughing, branches cracking, the appearance of grave markers, dozens of stickmen in the trees, Mike screaming for Josh, crying, Josh howling in terror in the blackness, bloody teeth appearing out of nowhere, feeling alone, in the tent, dark, cold, hungry, what was that noise? We're gonna die out here.<br/><br/>For the naysayers: I find that most people who complain about elements of the film don't seem to understand said elements. Heather screaming was annoying? She only screamed at the end of the film. Too many curses? Every ""R"" rated movie has curses, and this is how people in this situation would talk. They were stupid, and didn't do the ""smart"" thing? Like what? The point of them hiking South all day and ending up in the same place was to show you that there were supernatural elements involved. They were not getting out of those woods no matter what they did. ""Running like hell"" would not have helped. (running? would that have REALLY made a difference?) They kept their supplies and tried to keep their wits about them. They could not FIND the car. That was the point. They went into the house because they thought Josh was in there. Scared of piles of rocks? Well, yes... they were grave markers and they appeared outside their tent! Heather found Josh's bloody teeth wrapped in his shirt! Scared? How foolish of them!<br/><br/>Originality, genuine creepiness, no need for traditional boring plot devices, no trendy Hollywood teens in tight shirts, no predictable writing. Just fresh original scares that will affect you for a long long time. This film began haunting me when I merely viewed the trailers several months ago on Haxan's Web site, I slept with the kitchen light on for 2 months, and since then I have been a proud Blairhead."

"JMG-5","10","1","2","8 October 1999"," Excellent!
","Without a doubt the most interesting and frightening movie I've seen in a long time. The Blair Witch Project scares in a way that horror films haven't been able to since ""Halloween"": subtly. There's no outright, in-your-face terror and no discernible antagonist; what frightens you is whatever your mind conjures up - it's sad that so many people require the film makers to do that for them. There's a consistent sense of dread that saturates each scene, though it isn't always obvious, and watching the three kids slip irresistibly into madness is, at once, frustrating and mesmerizing. Pure emotion can be shattering to witness and The Blair Witch Project comes about as close as possible to capturing it. There is one particular scene in which an apology is recorded that is absolutely heartbreaking. It's that rawness and realism that make the days so captivating. Find me three cold, tired, wet, hungry and scared 20 year-olds who get along and don't swear like sailors and I'll give you a thousand dollars!  At night dread manifests itself in the form of pitch darkness, obscure noises and what sounds like children's voices, and the fear is not about being startled out of your seat as much as it's about burying yourself in it and not breathing. The movie builds on this fear and dread at night and returns to the frustration of day, continuously escalating.  Each day becomes more unbearable and each night becomes more frightening culminating in what is, truly, one of the most terrifying scenes I've ever watched. The final frames are absolutely haunting.<br/><br/>It's certainly not for everyone - what movie ever is? - but I can't recommend it enough."
"dalbuc","9","1","2","18 July 1999"," As good as Night of the Living Dead
","Some folks who I saw this film with left disappointed. It is not your typical horror film. There are no cheap scares or really jump out of your seats moments. Gore is almost totally nonexistent. Instead the movie is almost two stories. First, the story during the day about three college students who are lost in the woods and the dynamics as they slowly disintegrate as a group and as individuals. Second, the story at night where something is sitting just beyond the range of their cameras and lights hunting them. Blair Witch, like Night of the Living Dead, focuses more on the group dynamics than on the horror that lurks outside. It isn't clear which is more frightening- the unseen witch or the slow descent to madness of the individuals. The first person point of view created by viewing the ""documentary"" footage really puts you into the setting and leaves you straining to see what lies in the dark just like the characters do in the film.  It is a startling vision and one very much worth watching if you are looking for horror along the lines of Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, or The Thing- horror that is more psychological than visual."
"JG2001","10","1","2","3 October 1999"," This movie will scare the hell out of you.
","I can say without a doubt that The Blair Witch Project, beyond all the hype and the fact that it isn't real, is the scariest movie ever made. As the movie moves further along, the intensity will increase and keep increasing as if someone off screen were slowly turning a knob. It's hard to comment on this movie without giving to much away. As the film reached its climax, I was breathing hard and my heart felt like it was going to rip right out of my chest. When it was over, I was shaking all over, frightened out of my wits. It may sound silly, but that's what happened. It even reignited my fear of the dark. It's easy to make fun of the film from it's previews and the countless spoofs done on late night TV, but watch it and you'll probably be frightened too."

","This movie is what horror and terror is all about.<br/><br/>First let me comment on the bad reviews that I've read...some people say that the Blair Witch Project wasn't scary at all and some were bored by the experience.  These are the people that have no imagination and go in with the attitude ""this movie is all fake and pretends to be real...how dumb...""<br/><br/>OF COURSE IT'S FAKE!<br/><br/>Friday the 13th movies aren't scary for the same reason....they are totally fake.  What Blair Witch has that most horror films don't is an incredible feeling of suspense and wonderment.  You FEEL for these kids as they trek through the forest and lose their minds!<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too hard in the above comments, but when I was watching this movie, I (with use of my imagination) felt like I was on the trip too...everthing FELT so real...and the apology...and the final house sequence...That IS TERROR.<br/><br/>I go to movies to enjoy them and be totally immersed in them...not to criticize them and not enjoy myself..<br/><br/>In short this movie is THE HORROR film of the year!!

It was longer than the line for Godzilla, Jurassic Park, and any Batman movie I've seen. There had to be at LEAST 500 people in line for it. A group told me that they drove five hours from Mexico to see this movie. I've been hearing a lot of critics saying that twenty-somethings were not going to enjoy it because it didn't have blood and guts or Jennifer Love-Hewitt. Everyone in the theater was probably under 30, and it got huge applause at the end. People were walking out crying. Everyone loved it. Immediately went into my top ten best film"

What made it so creepy was the fact that we don't know what exactly was hunting the three filmmakers.  I think the fear of the unknown is more scarier than any digital monster or made up guy with a hockey mask...(although, I was scared by Halloween as well).  My brother and my Boyfriend both did not enjoy this movie.  They thought it was boring and unrealistic.  I can see their point as well.  When I put myself in their place, I know that I would not be filming anything.  I would have left all the camera gear and followed the river out.  It makes no sense at all.  But movies aren't always supposed to make sense.  Movies are merely meant for entertainment purposes only.  Also, concerning the motion with the camera's, I am the type that gets motion sickness extremely bad.  I can't even ride on a kid's swing with out wanting to throw up.  But, I didn't find the camera movement bad enough that I felt sick.  I loved the movie!

","Not since Hitchcock have directors realized that fear and thrill are not the same. People attending Blair Witch with the anticipation of chainsaws, bloody knives, and a jump a minute will be gravely disappointed. Fear is the gnawing in the pit of your stomach when your boss tells you in the morning he wants to see you at quitting time. Fear is when your usually-punctual child hasn't come home, and it's well after dark. Fear is what you can't see and don't know. Fear is what Blair Witch serves. In spades. I saw it twice. The second time was as nerve-wracking as the first. I won't see it again. This movie will be a classic."

Now before you skip by this let me say that I was not expecting any of the glitzy ""Hollywood Horror"" effects...no flashing lights, no witch, no blood, no gore.  I didn't want the shock value that ""typical"" horror movies give you. What I was expecting was genuine fear.  I wanted to walk out of the movie with the biggest forest phobia ever...were talking one major foilage fear. I wanted to have nightmares, and not be able to sleep.<br/><br/>Explain some things to me;  what is so terrorizing about the cheesy squeeling sound in the background???  You know, Casper the Ghost had almost the same sound...and I never saw the tagline ""scary as hell"" for that.  And the sticks in the trees...OH NO! An evil Girl Scout troop....RUN!!!  And the piles of rock...yes, rocks strike fear in even the bravest of hearts.  And as far as the shaking tent...um...ever been camping before..it's called wind. (or one of the crew...whichever).  Another thing...that bloody marshmallow in the piece of flannel shirt...it's supposed to be a ""part"" of Josh, right?  Tell me then, just where is the anatomically correct placement of a marshmallow???  And they all believed it!  Did it never occur to them (the characters) that this was the best ever practical joke of a boring small town??? <br/><br/>One of my biggest problems with this film is the ever existent need to get every freaking minute of the ""terror"" on film.  Now, I realize that these were supposed to be film students ...and Heather was supposed to be really hard-core ...but COME ON...who would film their demise rather than get the heck out of Dodge???  It just wasn't believable...not one iota.<br/><br/>I can't say that I blame them for all the hype...you gotta do something to bring the audience(s) in...I was just VERY disappointed.  I didn't find it brilliant..or anything else.  I got really tired of Heather's attitude and screaming, Josh's apathy, and Mike's...well, jerk-ness.  It just grew old WAY too fast.  I just could not get into the movie, and it has nothing to do with lack of imagination.  I just didn't believe in the characters, or the plot, or the ""fear"".<br/><br/>It didn't move me...unless you count my time trying to find the collector's edition of ""The Blair Witch Barf Bag"".  I think the worst part of it all was the hour I spent sitting on the floor in the hall of the theater (with 50 other people) waiting to make sure I got a seat.  <br/><br/>My Suggestion: wait for the video..and only waste $3.

Personally I thought that the movie was scary but the more I think about it the more terrified I become.  Almost every aspect of this movie is outstanding.  The camera work adds so much to making the experience more realistic, and while you are watching it you can almost feel what the characters are feeling.  And I found the movie overall to be very original, which is wonderful to see in a summer that is being dominated by movies which are full of distasteful humor or are high tech and without a plot. This movie doesn't have any gross humor and it is not high tech, but it could be the best movie of the summer.  If you have the opportunity to see this I highly recommend it."

They started their acting careers the honest and right way.  Unlike all those idiotic, not talented actors on WB, who many people for some reason think are cute and whatever they happen to think, Heather, Mike, and Josh are great actors with A LOT of talent.  They are famous for their talent, not for their looks.  That is what many people these days have to realize. Anyone who likes actors simply for their looks, and then associates that with their talent,must have some problem.  I know there are many people like that.  (people who post messages on the gay and stupid BSB and NSYNC's message boards are like that.  go and see for yourself).

What scares me about this movie is that there are people who think it is so good. Most of them seem to be critics. I certainly do not know anyone who has seen this movie who liked it. Of the eight people in the theater when I went in, three left before the end. I wish I had been so smart. In short, the movie was dull. Nothing happened. Three kids get lost and drop their cameras. The end. <br/><br/>The concept was good. Nothing else was. Terrible script. Terrible camera work. Terrible lighting. Terrible actors. The best thing that could happen to the entire crew on this film is to be lost in the woods and never return.

"Mourn-2","Null","1","2","17 July 1999"," Okay...the criticisms are valid, but its still very good.
","For those of you muddling through all the reviews of this movie, I am going to bottom-line it for you.  It's better than most of the crap coming out of the major studios.  It's better than about 80-90% of the films I've seen in the last few years.  Yes, its hokey at some points (its impossible to believe anyone would keep filming in some of the circumstances meeting the crew later in the movie).  It might be a stretch to call it brilliant, but if you try to avoid knowing TOO much about it, go sit in a dark theater and try not to over-analyze the little problems, it will scare you and it will leave you thinking about it.<br/><br/>Lastly, a quick commentary on the MPAA.  If I've ever seen a movie that should have carried a rating (NC17) to absoluteley keep kids out of the theater...this is it.  There is no specific shot or image or sound that would really even rate an R these days (except maybe for the excessive swearing).  But the theme of the movie is raw and intense and horrifying, way too strong for kids. I sat next to a young girl, maybe 10 or 11 and she was visibly shaken by what she saw.  The MPAA is a joke, we live in the only country in the world where Stanley Kubrick's final movie had to be edited to obscure some sex scenes to secure an R rating.  Yet this film, which could be emotionally traumatizing to a child, falls through the cracks because there is nothing blatantly pornographic.  Violence is much more damaging to the human mind than sex...wake up MPAA.<br/><br/>See the movie, leave the kids with the baby-sitter."

It really isn't the thought of a madman killer, or a swift, fatal disease--it is the unknown, the odd. And this film is full of the unsettling...the inexplicable. And that is why this film succeeds. Not by making us shriek in terror, but by giving us a gnawing feeling of unease and doubt.<br/><br/>One last note: If you are prone to motion sickness, wait for the video.

I had a few good laughs, and when the creepy stuff started to happen, it was an about-face to what had previously been presented. I was excited when the creepy stuff started to happen, but wasn't scared.<br/><br/>About half way through, the annoying over-acting of Heather really began to get to me (along with the heat in the theater) and I began to lose interest in what was going to happen the next time they heard noises outside.<br/><br/>BUT it was worth it to see the final scene, which scared the crap out of me and still leaves me with goose-bumps.

They also complain about the way TBWP seems it's a ""home video"", completely unprofessional. Really people, THAT WAS THE POINT!!! It wasn't made to look like a hollywood movie at all! And as we left the theater (I've seen it three times now) we talked about how people wouldn't like it because of it's non-hollywood style. And if you didn't think it was disturbing, or frightening in the least, you really need to get an imagination, and put yourself in the filmmakers shoes. So all've you are saying you wouldn't be freaked out if something like this happened to you? I know I would be! And I know when I went camping after seeing this movie I was very cautious! Also (SPOILERS AHEAD) the scene where Heather apologizes to everybody is the most powerful scene in movie history, period. I hope the academy gets smart and puts Heather Donahue and the movie up for an award, otherwise we're going to have more crap that's like Shakespear In Love winning again.<br/><br/>To sum it all up The Blair Witch Project is the best film I've ever seen as well as a classic!"

","First of all, I would like to say to all the people who absolutely hated this movie and gave it a 1 out of 10, YOU HAVE NO VISION. Whoever you are... you have no creativity, and your mind is about as open as the gate to Area 51. But then again, we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? ;)<br/><br/>This movie broke all the rules. Those who went to see it expecting chainsaws and gore or things suddenly leaping out at people are in for a surprise. I'm not saying movies like the Alien series or Scream, etc., aren't good... Blair Witch just has a completely different way of scaring you. The movie starts out humorous, with three film students setting off to research and report on a legend in a small town, and slowly grows more ominous with each passing minute. If you are actually willing to really WATCH this movie (and not immediately brush it off because of its initial appearance), you'll end up feeling more subtly disturbed afterwards than you may have thought upon going in. Most of my friends, people that have pretty much seen everything, well.... Let's just say that the average psychological disturbance for them was at least 2 days without any sleep. Same for me. The person I went with is rarely scared by anything, and he was white as a sheet during the last half of the movie (I was afraid to drive home alone after it, too!). There were a few days at work where everyone was grouchy and miserable from lack of sleep (most of us had seen it around the same time), but it was a GOOD lack of sleep... ;)<br/><br/>So there. I've either convinced you into seeing it for its genius or scared you into NEVER seeing it (sorry)... And if I say any more, I'll totally ruin it for you!<br/><br/>Blair Witch should at least receive an award for Original Screenplay this year, if nothing else. Good luck Mr. Myrick and Mr. Sanchez, thanks for the adrenaline-filled ride! (10/10)"

I, on the other hand, have lived in a very remote rural area in the woods, and this film has brought back skeletons from my closet.  When i came home from the theater, i basically came back to the setting for the film.  I have roamed around the woods, but never at night, even before the film i have always been too scared.  Now, i doubt i will ever go.  It is just too creepy.  A broken down home was also featured in the ending.  Houses like those are common place where i live.  i have been in the houses, and seeing them on the silver screen just makes my heart stop.  I picture myself standing in the corner and i can't handle it. If you have lived near the woods your whole life, you can understand the fear-unknown noises, isolation, and total Darkness.<br/><br/>The basis for the movie is evil, and i am glad to be going back to school, because it's a little too creepy to be hanging out around the woods...and a Civil War Battlefield with its own Ghosts....The mind and the imagination just run too wild."

"Liquid-5","Null","1","2","26 August 1999"," Intensely frightening and disturbing....
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of comments on this site about this movie saying it wasn't scary, or that there was no plot, or that the dialogue was dumb because it was made up. I guess it's easy to understand how some people would say that, with the way horror films are run and made and promoted now. I'm an avid horror fan myself, I love the flicks. And any that really ever scared me, the few that have, I always rationalized and got rid of my fear. Like saying to myself, ""Ah, those guys live in Indiana, that can't happen here,"" or, ""Well, no big deal, they killed the thing, it can't get me now."" The only movie that still terrifies me that I can't put the fear out of is The Exorcist. Why? No way to say it couldn't happen. The reality is that that particular film shows you a real case of something that you have no defense over. If you believe in the Devil, then that movie is a terror simply because it says that no matter where you are, hey, you could be taken over by this thing. That's scary, man. Blair Witch is very similar. It doesn't really scare you, in the way that it constantly makes you jump or hits you in the face with some terrifying thing, or monster. Instead, it erodes at your security and your disbelief. When the movie starts, you think they'll go off, and see some scary thing, and blah blah blah. But much like real life, it's never that simple. The greatest power that Blair Witch uses on you is that you can actually believe in what is happening. No huge monster is ever shown, no real proof of what is going on is presented. And there lies the strength. You believe what you want to, and no matter what you decide, you can defend that opinion. The improvised dialogue only strengthens the realism of the film. Would you really buy into the premise of a movie claiming it was real if the actors were spouting tired lines like, ""These woods are quiet...too quiet."" Instead, you have people saying what people in real life say when they are put in a situation they can't get out of and are placed in danger. We all revert back to scared animals when the situation is right, or wrong in this case, and that's what happens: These three people devolve into irrational behavior and let overriding fear determine what they do. This film is unique in how it defies any common genre label; to call it a horror film is a slant because you imply it fits in with the classic definition of a horror film. Calling it a thriller, thought, takes away some of its credit. It's simply a movie that will leave you disturbed, thinking of what it would be like to be in that situation. If you liked it, you'll look at the woods around you, just the night itself, in a new way. If you hate it, you usually think how you'd have reacted differently in that scenario. Either way, the movie makes you take a new look around you and at how you think. That alone gives it a large amount of worth that few movies made today can match."
"Joan-30","1","1","2","26 August 1999"," Too much hype
","I eagerly awaited the arrival of ""Blair Witch"" to the theater and excitedly went last week.  I was so upset with the movie.  I think that there might have been too much hype surrounding the movie, because I guess I expected it to be spectacular but instead found it boring.  Nothing was really scary and the end, which everyone told me was spell-binding, left me wondering, ""Thats it?  Its over?""  The movie focuses more on the conflict between the film makers than the witch.  What a let down!"
"HarryC13","9","1","2","26 August 1999"," The Blair Witch Mystique: Fiction Well Done
","Such a mystique surrounds ""The Blair Witch Project.""  I don't know why so many people are so hung up on the movie being ""real.""  So what if it's fiction?  It's well-done fiction.  It didn't take away from ""The Fly"" for me to know that giant mutant flies don't really exist ... nor did it take away from ""The Howling"" to know that werewolves don't exist.  Why all the squawking about this being truth rather than fiction?<br/><br/>I think the fact that it's filmed with relatively primitive equipment, and in a ""realistic"" manner, contributes to some people's refusal to believe it's fabrication.  Also, while the Internet has hyped many a movie, ""Blair Witch"" makes more extensive use of this medium (and adds the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" special on Sci-Fi.)  So some of the more gullible of us, thinking anything we read or see on TV must be true, believe it.<br/><br/>I personally think it's somewhat frightening that we confuse the carefully done websites and the Sci-Fi special -- which dispense mythology specifically created to heighten the Blair Witch experience -- with factual news reporting.  Get a grip, people.  The websites and the special are absolutely BRILLIANT from the standpoint of adding to the feeling of realism surrounding the movie.<br/><br/>Let's just recognize ""The Blair Witch Project"" for the groundbreaking, interesting, and scary movie it is.  That's sure enough for me!"
"sidney-14","Null","1","2","25 August 1999"," seeing it cold
","Reading the other comments showed how much seeing this film could be affected by the publicity it has obviously received. The film isn't out yet in England and I saw it in Paris today with only a vague idea of what it was about. What I saw was a pretty grim look at three American kids utterly unprepared for an encounter with evil. The point to make is that the film was not trying to scare me; it was trying to show in a very convincing way what it is like to be scared, cold, hungry and lost. It has always been the rarest thing for a film to show people not coping and falling apart; films don't like to admit that we are not always in control of our lives. Although a completely different kind of film it reminded me of ""The Dream Life of Angels"" from France last year; the same wintry light and the same barely glimpsed death at the end. Go and see it but leave all of your expectations outside."

The last five minutes almost save it, but there's just too much resentment built up as a combination of the hype surrounding this movie and the inane dialogue."
"ayed","10","1","2","25 August 1999"," Pseudo-documentary that is truly frightening
","Let me preface these comments by saying that I have never been scared by a movie in my 20 years of viewing.  Sure, isolated moments in some of the more effective films of the horror genre have made me jump, but I have never experienced the growing dread and unease inspired by The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>By now, the media-hype surrounding the unprecedented box-office success of this shoestring budget indie film has begun to overshadow the power of the pure film experience.  This is a shame.  I wish everyone could come to this film as I did -- unaware of the hype, knowing just the barest plot details. Add to that mix a quiet, respectful audience (though very near the theatre's 500 seat capacity) in a Maryland cinema.... and you would have the ideal ambiance for enjoying (is that the right word?) this film.  Too many people are going to see Blair Witch with their expectations artificially inflated and, inevitably, many of them will be disappointed because this film does NOT hold your hand in the typical Hollywood fashion, revealing all its secrets and tying the plot's threads into a neat package at film's end.<br/><br/>To those of you who have yet to see the film, these words of advice: do not immerse yourself in the media coverage before you go.  Do not seek out the ""answers"" to the film's unresolved questions found on web pages and in the film's companion book.  The power of this movie is its ability to make you empathise with the fairly mundane yet primal emotions expressed by the actors.  As you follow the ""filmmakers"" on their journey into the woods, you feel the characters' frustration, confusion, disorientation, and, most importantly, fear of the unknown.  The tangible ""horrors"" of standard ""scary movies"" -- the killer in the hockey mask, the monster stalking the summer camp -- are constrained the moment their image appears on film.  Blair Witch proves (as do the perpetually disappointing adaptations of Stephen King's genuinely frightening novels) that hinted-at, suggested horrors fleshed out by the viewer's (or reader's) imagination are far more powerful than the best work of Hollywood's special effects teams."

","I just finished reading over many of the other comments on this film and it was interesting to me the overwhelming negative response I noticed.  I personally didn't think that this movie wasn't exceptionally scary, however, I thought it was excellently done.  Interestingly enough, many people have taken shots at the acting in this movie.  The irony is that your criticisms are a testimony to the abilities of the movie makers to capture a ""non-acted"" performance from the actors.  The fits and ""insanity"" between the actors during many scenes do justice to the attempt here to create a ""documentary"" feel.  This movie was never intended to look or feel like a high budget Hollywood film, and it doesn't.  What is does feel like is an authentic experience of the three.  The scare factor lies in your own mind. You can easily sit through this movie and not be scared of anything, or you can leave terrified if you allow yourself to submerge into the intensity of the film.  The precept behind the film is fascinating.<br/><br/>And although many people also criticize the hype surrounding the movie, I think that it is that mythology that creates the movie.  It is the entire package that makes the experience worth while. I would recommend it as a great experience.  No, it is not an incredible work of cinematography, but it is a remarkable film."

","People say that the script of The Blair Witch Project was contrived and not clever, but this movie is incredibly realistic because it DOESN'T have all the usual witty Hollywood dialogue--this is what teenagers would *really* do and say in a situation that scares them.  The ""boring"" scenes at the beginning only add to the tension and realism.  I wasn't as scared as I expected to be but I was *not* disappointed.  It's true you don't particularly like the characters, but that only seems to make them more realistic.<br/><br/>Now this movie is permanently stamped into my mind.  I can not stop seeing over and over the last couple seconds.  I can't get that image out of my mind.  (Not a spoiler...you'll see what I mean when you see the film.)<br/><br/>
As everyone has mentioned before, you will be more scared if you are imaginative because this film is mostly psychological and leaves it up to your imagination to figure out what's going on.  Probably not a good idea if you get motion sick (I didn't at all, but some people...) or if you like only gory, action packed horror films--or if you are going to be in the house alone for a while.<br/><br/>I never knew *trees* could look so scary....<br/><br/>P.S.

(Other than the Shining and about three other films, I've never liked or been scared by a horror film).  The film exceeded even my wildest expectations.  The script and premise are genius, and the acting and directing fully lived up to potential.  This horror film is unique in many ways.  One reason it works so well is its realism.  Everything that occurs could be either natural (a crazed serial killer or cult) or supernatural. The mockumentary footage is extremely believable in its amateurism.  The character development is perfectly believable.  It also scares you much more by NOT showing you anything.  My imagination kept me up until 5 am!

It was purposely done that way to achieve a desired effect, which in my case, it did in fact achieve.<br/><br/>****"
"ADM-4","10","1","2","16 July 1999"," The Scariest Movie Ever
","This film is so scary because it is so pure. It never abandons its two main conceits: the documentary footage, and the invisibility of the terror. The result traps you in a way that other horror films fail to. You never see the hatchet man waiting around the corner, you never peer through a bedroom window, you never have a point-of-view removed from the characters. The effect of this, drawn out over 90 minutes, is startling, especially to viewers accustomed to the tongue-in-cheekiness of Scream, the irony of which purposely distances us from the character's terror. In Blair Witch, there is no distance: we see what they see, we feel what they feel.<br/><br/>The facelessness of the terror contrasts with the other horror films that stay with you days afterward. The Shining and The Exorcist, for example, both put a demon of sorts inside of an ordinary human. Your fear comes from watching what these humans-gone-awry do to other people, and from the implication that the ""demon"" is really just a malevolence lying dormant inside each of us, or at least inside someone you know.<br/><br/>By contrast, Blair Witch lets the terror inhabit the woods, immutable and insuperable. In The Shining, there is always the hope that Jack will come to his senses or Danny will escape. In The Exorcist, you can hope that the little girl will just ""go back to normal."" There is no such hope in Blair Witch.<br/><br/>There are a hundred places in this film where it could have gone wrong, but amazingly, the cast and crew pulled it off without a hitch. A few of the film's early moments don't ring quite true, but these incidents are minor, and forgotten as soon as the kids get into the woods.<br/><br/>Once they get there, it is impossible to take your eyes off the screen. As one of the characters says (roughly), ""I'm afraid to close my eyes, but I'm afraid to keep them open.""<br/><br/>It is amazing how potent the film's photography is, in light of the actors being the chief camera operators. The ad hoc nature of the photography is nonetheless gripping, as the film's publicity shots reveal. Among the thousands of shots that comprise the film, though, it is one that most stands out in my mind: the film's final image will never leave me."

Saying it was worth the wait is something of an understatement.  The hype and myths surrounding this modern horror masterpiece are, for once, understandable and well-founded.  I have often been downright terrified by watching horror films alone at home on video (Repulsion, Halloween, and The Haunting - the old one - are three that readily come to mind), but this was the first instance where I was absolutely terrified in an actual theatre.  The pace of the film is masterful, letting us relax and laugh fairly often near the beginning, then slowly and inexorably tightening its grip until the absolutely terrifying final moments.

"HarryC13","9","1","2","20 August 1999"," The Witching Hour (well, 87 minutes)
","I used to review books and movies professionally, so I hope my comments will add a few fresh perspectives.  First, let me say that it's obvious that this is not the kind of movie that everyone will like.  People biased against seeing horror films won't; people who want technical perfection in the filmmaking process won't; people who want an airtight and tightly wound plot won't.  And I agree that the film has its problems - lots of gratuitous profanity, a tendency to drag about two-thirds through, and some plot points that aren't entirely clear.  For example, I didn't tie in how some of the residents' brief comments in the beginning affected the movie's ending (and various other events).  But they do impact it.  Maybe I just need to be hit over the head, but I didn't get it the first time around.<br/><br/>All that said:  I love `The Blair Witch Project.'  Took me two viewings to really appreciate it.  The first time, I found it fascinating  and the second time, I found it scary, especially when I `got' the ending. Scariest movie ever?  No.  But for a combination of scary and interestingly done, it scores big points.<br/><br/>Unlike some reviewers, I found the acting very realistic.  Some of the negative reviews I've read cite problems:  The actors wouldn't have done this or that, usually.  One reviewer said student filmmakers are very savvy these days, and the filming wouldn't have been that rough around the edges. He said this totally spoiled the movie for him.  Lighten up  all fiction, and especially horror fiction, requires suspension of disbelief.  And horror films are notorious for having plot holes, unlikely things happening, and people going where they shouldn't.  In fact, in a lot of horror flicks, if people acted realistically there would be no plot!  And obviously fake studio-lot trees and dry-ice `fog' certainly didn't keep `The Wolf Man' from being a horror classic, at least not for me.<br/><br/>I also disagree that finding out how the film was made or that it isn't a true story make it a lesser experience.  Sure didn't for me.   And I'm glad to see some other comments here that tell me I'm not the only one with the `hangover' effect  it ran across my mind for days after I saw it.  By the nature of its filming, Blair Witch gets a little vague in its plot sometimes, but it more than makes up for this with its freshness and genuine thrills.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the intricate Internet and TV framework of mythology  what negative reviewers call `hype' -- that's been built up around the movie.  I think it's a stroke of genius.<br/><br/>There's talk of a sequel.  Personally, I'd like to see a `prequel' built around the Blair Witch mythology created on the film's home page and in the Sci-Fi special, `Curse of the Blair Witch.'<br/><br/>All in all, I'd rate this right up there with `The Exorcist' and the original version of `The Haunting' as the best of the post-1960 horror films.  Although each has its own special brand of horror, each keeps its place well secured in my memory.  As to those who are disappointed that they didn't `see the witch' or needed some presence to scare them, blame modern horror cinema for spoiling them with special effects and gore.  Those who don't like the film for these reasons would never `get' a classic ghost story."
"kairkot","10","1","2","20 August 1999"," fear?!
","I think in the way The Blair Witch Project was made, alone, adds character to the film (first person). The most scary movie I have ever seen has been The Exorcist, but I would have to say The Blair Witch Project conjured up the most fear. There is an indescribable fear that you get when you watch the last five minutes of this film. I guess I could say that this movie is fear - not a fear one experiences from having a monster pop out from behind a tree, but the type of fear one could only have from feeling hopelessly afraid. Five stars in my book!"

"WorkingClassDog","9","1","2","20 August 1999"," Stylish, original scares delivered by the sleeper of the summer...
","I went to see BWP after hearing the hype, seeing the hype, web-surfing the hype... being assaulted by it on every front.  My only regret is that I had been tipped off that the docu-drama was actually a movie, and not real.  If I had sat down to watch this movie, buying into the concept that these kids were real, and so was their terror, I would have been much more terrified.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, I loved this movie... it is the most original scary movie to come out in years.  It brings back memories of the type of psychological scares that Hitchcock's films would bring to your mind.  Sometimes the *scariest* things are the things you don't see... this movie brilliantly illustrates that concept.  The scenes of the kids running through the woods, being chased by enemy or enemies unknown are genuinely scary. (I don't think I'll ever feel the same way about camping again.)<br/><br/>Heather's screams haunted me for days after watching the movie, as did both kid's cries for their friend when they don't know where he is.  I have to say I was going into this movie expecting a completely different sort of movie, growing up in an age of slash/scream/gore/Freddie/Chuckie/Jason-type horror flicks.  I was very surprised and haunted after watching this movie. Highly recommended, 9 stars out of 10."
"CplHicks-5","10","1","2","16 July 1999"," Inventive, creepy, and extremely entertaining
","There's something to be said about a movie that is not afraid to keep the audience from seeing what would calm their fears.  This film aims for much more than cheap thrills.  The Blair Witch Project will stay with you for a long while after you exit the theater, which makes the movie one of the most original horror films in recent times. To be honest, the movie is not all that scary until, I believe, the last 20 minutes of the picture.  I guarantee you I will never forget the horrific, yet unspectacular final images of this movie.  I praise filmmakers like this.  David Fincher did just that when he made both Seven and The Game.  A real scare never really leaves you, especially when you never get to see that which torments you.  At the very least, this film should be commended for its ability to tell a coherent story using the most basic of film and video equipment. The acting, almost completely improvised, is stellar; the three characters are at all times believable and sympathetic.  The first hour or so of the film establishes Heather, Josh, and Mike very well via funny situations and moments to which the average person can relate, which sets you up for the inevitable nightmare that is the last reel of the movie. The story is so absorbing because it's, literally, a scary story you tell around the campfire.  It's a brand new urban legend(sorry to reference such a terrible film) that will probably endure for quite a while.  The use of handheld 8mm video and gritty 16mm film gives you a direct and literal perspective of the person holding the camera.  You see what they see just as they see it.  You are at the whim of the cameraman(or woman), unable to control what you are about to discover. I highly recommend the Blair Witch Project for anyone who, for a change, wants to be taken somewhere they haven't been in a long time:  the darkest pits of their imagination."
"Lucian-4","10","1","2","19 August 1999"," Creepy, funny, and different.
","I don't know what the people who hated this movie were expecting.  I realize that it was over-hyped and all, but I just relaxed and went into an extremely crowded theater and enjoyed the movie.  I was absolutely drawn to the characters.  They reminded me of situations where I had been in close proximity with friends or acquaintances and we had gotten on each other's nerves.  It was totally believable and really hilarious the way though fought with each other.  I'll admit that sometimes, in the parts that were supposed to be scary, I started to giggle because the things they were saying were so funny.  But I thought that the filmmakers and actors did a fantastic job of creating a building sense of dread throughout the movie. There wasn't much of a plot, but there didn't need to be.  As a person who makes art and does a lot of writing, I know sometimes you want to tell a story and sometimes you just want to create a feeling.  The point of this movie was to get you acquainted with the characters and make you feel their emotions.  It wasn't the scariest thing in the world, but for what it accomplished, I can't fault it at all.  If you want gore or spooky special effects, there are plenty of options.  This movie offers something different.  I am so glad to see younger people do something so good and be financially rewarded for it.  And the last shot absolutely creeped me out."
"Evita-6","10","1","2","19 August 1999"," Great Movie, if you are willing to pay attention!
","It really irritates me to read all these summaries trashing THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  The people who write these reviews are the people who go into the movie excepting a slasher movie such as Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, where you don't actually have to pay attention to the dialogue, you can just watch people get killed.  Furthermore, its hard to be scared in a crowded movie theater, especially if you go in there determined not to be scared.  SO FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO ARE DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO SEE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, IT IS A MUST SEE.  IF YOU ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE DIALOGUE(SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHATS HAPPENING) AND LET YOURSELF GET INTO IT, IT IS ACTUALLY VERY SCARY.  IT WILL GET TO LATER.

Yeah, I'll concede that it was NOT the most brilliant work of art I've ever seen. But it serves as a reminder that today's jaded audiences can still be scared. And, to be perfectly clear, I liked it. I'll take a shorter cut, if it could retain the feel - the arguing did seem to drag. Still, it played like a campfire ghost story, reeling you into suspension of disbelief to deliver its wallop.<br/><br/>Pros: Audacity, Style, Acting, Concept.<br/><br/>Cons: Camera Work, Hype, Length<br/><br/>Rating: ******** (8/10)"

I felt myself slowly getting more and more frightened during the duration of this movie. As the characters slowly began to lose it, I felt myself losing it with them. This movie definitely scares you with its subtlety: the noises heard in the distance, the cackling, the cries for help. The darkness carries the movie's fear factor. I felt myself holding my breath at several parts. My girlfriend's fingernails dug into my hand at some parts--mainly the end. The end is truly disturbing. The image will remain with you. I was definitely spooked, disturbed, frightened......I'll tell you what: It'll be a while before I go hiking in the woods again."

One of the things that made it scary was the use of the cameras.  I am sure that if it was filmed on the film that is used with regular movies, I don't think it would have been half as scary.

","I got to see a showing of ""The Blair Witch Project"" on opening night at 11:05 P.M.  By the time I was on my way home, I had to call my parents in order to tell them to turn all of the lights in the house on.  I also made sure that I didn't have to go anywhere near the basement... ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the scariest movie of all time, period. Although I may not be as learned as others on the subject, I don't give a damn.  BWP does not frighten you with images of a witch, or her gory kills. Instead, it plants traces of unknown horrors in to the viewers sub-conscious.  That, in my opinion, is far worse than visual horror.  The actors did an amazing job of portraying terrified people reaching their wits end.  My heart pounded just as fast Heather Donahue's; I guarantee.  The leads' acting ability surprised the hell out of me.  At no moment did I remember that BWP was fiction.  The actors (and directors!) do that good a job.  Do yourself a favor: See ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Oh, and if you've got a special person in your life, bring 'em along.  You might need 'em..."

The fact that it was filmed entirely with a home video camera makes it all the more real.  The Blair Witch Project really breaks the sterotype that scary movies are never good and always have a stupid and unrealistic story.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen also.

I went to see it with 4 other people and afterwards we sat around anaylzing it and freaking each other out even more.  Two of us are going to see it again!  The best part of the movie is that it leaves a lot to your imagination and allows you to draw your own conclusions.  I am glad that I didn't read any message boards before I went to see it, I think that would have spoiled it slightly (especially if I had read the ending).  I hadn't seen any previews.  All that I knew was that 3 students mysteriously disappeared and a year later their film footage was discovered.  The funniest part is I actually stayed up later doing truth/or not research on the movie in order to get some sleep!!!  I'd rate it a 9 out of 10."

I especially enjoy this movie because it allows the viewer to ""fill in the blanks"" with whatever their mind can conjure up. No amount of blood and gore can compare to the unnatural thoughts of anyone. I am often disappointed, however, when I leave the theater and I hear comments such as ""That wasn't very realistic- her eyebrows didn't even grow much!"" (True, I heard this!) I think many people are looking for a cheap thrill and it won't be found here. BWP is an intelligent horror film which intelligent people will enjoy."

And even with the expectations I had of this movie, which were pretty high, I thought this was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I won't say that it utterly terrified me, but it was eerie in the extreme. Especially after *not going to spoil it totally* disappears. I recommend this to anyone who can go in and watch this movie not for what it is (a low-budget movie with a great concept and execution), but for what it's supposed to be (a chilling account of three students' run in with the unknown).<br/><br/>It may not be real, but it's alot scarier if you treat it as though it is.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

Let me say that it is very easy to sit down and watch this film without feeling a single emotion (other than boredom). But let me also point out that watching this film in the right attitude can lead to one of the most heart pounding rides of the last twenty years. If you're anticipating the thrill ride, you may be disappointed. If you're expecting a yawner, you may be shocked. Blair Witch Project will be one of those films, like David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"", that you either love or you hate. Go see it once to find out how you feel, it's only $8.00.

It is an intensely shot film with very good acting.  The dialogue is fresh and real, and the pain and suffering of the characters is genuine.  The situation is not highbrow.

Everything, every heart-stopping, blood-curdling, seat-wetting moment of pure fright-filled bliss.

Basic plot, three wannabe Truffauts wander into a local forest in search of a local legend.  They disappear, and all we are left with is the film they shot while on their journey.<br/><br/>I don't need to tell you that.  Chances are, if you are reading this, then you know how to use the internet, and there really is no point in rehashing the plot.  You know it.  You knew it before you left your safe, dank computer dungeon.  The web was Â‘the' form of advertisement for ""Blair.""  In this fact alone, I believe it will act as a catalyst for great changes in how movies are advertised.  Finally, Hollywood will use the internet as we've been using the internet: as a resource, not simply entertainment<br/><br/>I've heard ""The Blair Witch Project"" touted as the ""scariest film since ""The Exorcist.""  I felt it goes way beyond that.  To be scared by that, you had to be Catholic; to be scared by this, you have to simply have an imagination.  There is one scene which totally encapsulates the entire feel of the film.  It's the ""Close-up on Heather scene.""  If you've seen it, you know what I mean.  The pure terror that dances in her eyes makes even the most devout fan of ""Deliverance"" afraid to go camping.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is as scary as you make it.  If you looked up at the sky when you were younger and saw bunnies and duckies, then go see ""Babe 2,"" ""Iron Giant,"" or some other family fare.  If in those clouds you gazed into your own mortality, go see ""The Witch."""

Either it hooks you totally (as happened to my husband Walt) and it's the most terrifying movie you've seen in ages, or it doesn't (as happened to me) and it's unconvincing at best and boring at worst.  The hook is that you are watching footage of something that supposedly happened, accentuated by the (necessarily) jerky camera work.  If you tend to be aware that you're watching a movie (my husband), it comes off as believable because you're watching ""what actually happened"".  If you normally have fantastic suspension of disbelief (me), to the point where what happens on the screen is what's happening to you, the camera work constantly reminds you that you're just watching a movie and you can't get into it.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend taking motion sickness medicine an hour before watching this movie!!!  I'm sure glad I did!<br/><br/>If nothing else, BWP is fascinating as a psychological study of three people breaking down while trying to cope with an intensely unpredictable and stressful situation that they can't leave and that is out of their control.

ITS PROBABLY A DEAR OR SOMETHING. NO, ITS NOT. THE SOUNDS ARE COMMING FROM ALL AROUND US. WHAT IS THAT. OH MY GOD! ITS GETTING LOUDER! OH MY GOD! ITS COMMING CLOSER! OH MY GOD! WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT! OH MY GOD, ITS EVERYWHERE!<br/><br/>That is just a sample of how the new film by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" is able to scare the living daylights out of an audience without ever having to include scary music, graphic violence, or a gooey, slimy, bloodthirsty creature. The film is created with no special effects either and much of it takes place during the night, and being shot from a camcorder, there is only a black screen in front of us. We witness no one's death--although there are several murderous events that are implied heavily. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the years best films.<br/><br/>
The movie is more of a documentary than a regular horror thriller. It is based on a 1994 event in Maryland, where three film students, Heather, Josh, and Michael, all follow the idea of Heather to go out into the woods by themselves during the weekend and shot film on the legendary Blair Witch who is supposed to haunt an area nearby. They begin with interviewing people who have seen and or heard about the witch. Then they take one of their cars and drive into the supposedly haunted woods. All of this is being shot on one of two home video cameras held by either Heather or Mike, therefore we see all of the story through the eyes of the characters. What a novelty!<br/><br/>Their first day of shooting however, they begin to finds some very weird things. Like a pile of rocks staked in accordance to one of the interviewed witnesses' descriptions. Then what looks like big voodoo symbols carved in the sand and made out of sticks and twigs that appear everywhere. What could be doing this? One of the students believes someone is playing a joke on them. But Heather knows that nobody has any knowledge of their presence there. Therefore, it must be something else...<br/><br/>Then mysterious things begin to occur. First the crew discovers they seem to be lost in the woods and have somehow gone off the rout--but Heather insists otherwise. Then they notice the map carried by Heather has disappeared. Soon afterward they start to turn on one another going from being best friends to constantly fighting and bickering at each other. After that, they detected that they have been traveling in circles all day long--and have not covered an inch of ground. That night the crew hears strange noises coming from all around them--ones that sound like young children screaming in pain--but no body is out there with them? When Josh disappears the night afterward, and severed fingers are found the next day, things really begin to heat up. <br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is enlightening and intelligent from the very first scene, allowing us to participate in the characters discoveries, arguments and horrors. The opening is wonderfully crafted by detailing the interviews of the witnesses that not only arise our superstition, but also train our fantasy for what is prom to soon happen. The witnesses cleverly describe that the say ""something"" in the woods, not outright telling us it was a witch,  giving us a gold mine for our imagination to feast upon. And by showing us next to nothing throughout the film, this lets us become seriously involved with the characters.  <br/><br/>The movie's structure is perfection in itself--and original. The gradual increase in tension--how the crew stars out finding clues, then more and more things begin to happen like the sounds at night, the disappearance of Josh--is what makes this film so frightening. It also develops the character's feelings and emotions using this form of composition. My only complaint is that I think this movie lacks some true suspense, unlike the very well off completion ""The Sixth Sense."" ""The Blair Witch Project"" only went for all out terror without ever really getting into a build up. But given the structure use, it is perfectly understandable that this minor flaw is present. <br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a data movie in the least. When I attended this film's screening a sat in the back of a young twosome presumable on a date that were squirming in their seats during this movie. The girl was almost asleep and the boy was trying his hardest to please her; going out of the theater to get refills on  popcorn, soda etc. I was thinking to myself that they were closed minded here, and were looking for some graphic action movie. As the movie ended in one of the most tense cliffhanger manors that I have ever seen, only to have them mutter ""finally, its over,"" I made a note to warn you in advance: if you are looking for an action packed, muscle mannered, explosive special effects extravaganza, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not for you. If you are looking for a very different view at a scary subject dealing out its terror as psychological tension, and are willing to give the screen your imagination and involvement for 80 minutes, then go see this one. It may make you think twice about going out into the woods again."

","The filmmakers painted themselves into an intriguing but quite confining premise, having to abide by certain rules in order to succeed:  The cast must be isolated and not allowed to escape, there must be a reason why these people would continue to record footage even after they've gone insane with fear, and there can't be any definitive resolution with regards to the antagonist. Despite having all these limitations to abide by, the film works.<br/><br/>The directors cover their bases with a few obligatory yet adequate explanations. No, it won't ""scare the hell out of you"" as some have claimed. The day scenes are basically ""MTV's Real World Gets Lost in the Woods"", as we watch our protagonists slowly start to dissolve into panic and then madness. The suspense arrives in the night scenes, where the danger is unknown and unseen.  Watching (or often merely listening to) the events from the actor's POV makes for quite a powerful experience. The grainy, shaky footage adds an important element of mock authenticity. The performances are mostly solid all around, especially from Williams. Donohue does a good job of playing melodramatic during the so-called ""documentary"" sequences, making her ""normal"" performance seem that much more natural. Very effective.<br/><br/>Because this scenario is portrayed so realistically, a large segment of the audience seems to disallow the usual generosity normally given to a film's artistic license.  Bruce Willis would never survive a fall from the top of an exploding skyscraper, of course, but we have to ignore that discrepancy in order to further the experience. It is a movie, after all.  And even though BLAIR WITCH is supposed to be ""real"", we have to give it the same amount of latitude.  Sure there are a few holes to contend with (why don't they just go to a stream and follow it?), and there's a little bit of overacting from Donohue towards the end. But the bottom line is that, aside from a few minor flaws, the limited concept could not have been executed any better."

","The Blair Witch Project was the most original movie I've ever seen in my life.  Despite the fact that it was made to look like a home video, the plot and characters were entertaining and original.  This movie has been given the title as the scariest movie since The Exorcist.  Well I didn't find the Exorcist a bit scary, and The Blair Witch Project had an eerie effect to it. It isn't the Scream-style scares you're used to.  This movie should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good movie. I give this film an A+"
"Kate-98","10","1","2","16 August 1999"," A must see for ALL movie fans!
","I definitely had my expectations a little high when I went to see this movie.  I had tried twice before to get tickets only to find that it was sold-out.  So, when I finally got to see the movie, I was really excited. The movie was great!  I have to admit that when it ended, I wasn't as scared as I thought it would be.  But, then I got home that night, and I could not go to sleep.  Usually scary movies don't get to me like that, but I was genuinely afraid to open my bedroom door in the morning!!  This movie is one of a kind, and should be viewed by everyone, just for its originality. But, this movie is more than original, it will keep you afraid for weeks after having viewed it.  I am living proof!!"
"Brighton-2","Null","1","2","16 August 1999"," Not A Conventional Horror Film
","This was one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in years and one of the most frightening I've ever seen.  No it's not The Shining or The Exorcist but it's original in its execution.  Although I can see why many left the theater disappointed (many in my theater were), having expected more to happen at the end of the movie, I do not blame the film.  The Blair Witch Project is perfect and entertaining as is.  The American movie going public is shamelessly trained to expect everything to be shown to them and handed to them on a plate.  This film expects the audience to use their imaginations and own fears to complete the horror.  There is no need to have a Scooby Doo-the-gardener-did-it-ending. That's what films like Scream are for.  I was frightened by the isolation, the horror of the darkness, the unknown, and the anxiety that these amateur film makers were experiencing. The quality of the filming made it seem like we were peaking into someone's life where everything went terribly wrong.  I loved the ending!  I only hope that we haven't been so brainwashed by the formula based, high budget, blood and gore flicks that offer cheap scares and inventive weapons that we don't forget that what scares us the most when lights are off is what we do not see."
"Casey-52","10","1","2","16 August 1999"," One of the scariest movies I've ever seen
","Yes, the title of my comment is overused here already, but this movie really is very scary. I can't top most of the comments already said, but I just need to say that those people who think this is overhyped obviously need to consider their thoughts of horror films. If the fans of today expect a horror film like SCREAM (which is pretty pathetic), then of course they won't like this film. The audiences of today don't want to get involved in horror films, they don't want to think, it's sad but true! While watching this movie, you have to become involved with the movie, pay attention to everything, analyze the events that are happening, come to conclusions of your own. That is how you will really get scared. Let your imagination do the work or are you too lazy to do that?<br/><br/>By the way, has anyone ever thought the events of the movie might never have happened, the filmmakers could have just imagined it all and gone insane because of isolation. Just a thought."
"Woppletinger","Null","1","2","26 August 1999"," Creepy but not as scary as a big rubber shark
","As you may have guessed from my one line summary, Jaws scared me more than this. I find this an interesting comparison because much of the scares in both movies comes from never seeing the shark/witch/whatever. However, in Jaws this was scary, whereas here there's just not enough clarification. NO, I DON'T WANT THE WITCH TO MORPH FROM A TREE DRIPPING BLOOD AND ALL DONE UP LIKE LINDA BLAIR IN THE EXORCIST, BUT I would like to know just what the heck it was. About the best clarification in the movie as to this is ""No redneck would think of this"" or something. Yay. Early on, we get a description of the Witch that very much matches the ending, BUT I decided to disregard this because all the other interviews at the start suggested something totally different and really seemed more funny than scary, apparently intentionally. Indeed, we all know from ads and hype that there are many Scary Weird Noises In The Night sequences, but only late in the movie do these sections become scary. Why? Because the early ones are at the longest a minute, and in daylight there just isn't anything quite strange enough to scare you. And believe me, there's a LOT of daytime in this movie. And 95% of it is them arguing, usually two characters screaming at each other ""f--- this"" and the other countering ""f--- that,"" culminating in ""f--- you"" while the third party member screams ""shut the f--- up."" At one point, when one character turns really cruel, not violent, but mean, the confrontation is fairly tense, but really more at home in a soap. The end, yes, it's quite creepy. No, not the final shot. Just the last few minutes. Not everyone will agree--as the movie ended, the entire audience sat silently--for three seconds. Then some brave and obnoxious souls offered ""You've gotta be kidding me,"" and, more to the point, ""That sucked"" and ""Boooooo..."" Is it worth seeing? Well, yeah, if only out of curiosity. It's still a pretty good movie. But Scary as Hell(TM)? No."
"chas77","8","1","2","16 August 1999"," A lot of people are missing the point...
","I think that a lot of the dissatisfied viewers are missing the point here. It's really quite a simple, effective movie. Not simple as ""for simpletons"" or stupid people, but simple in that its whole set up relies on its minimalist structure.<br/><br/>It's easy for a lot of people to say, ""why didn't they read the survival book, bring a cel phone, etc."" The point is, they didn't think they needed these items. These were cocky filmmakers who weren't worried. It was just going to be a weekend trip. If any of you have been camping before, I'm sure you can relate. As for the cel phone, did anyone think that maybe they couldn't afford one?<br/><br/>As a guy who was a student filmmaker at one time, I can DEFINITELY relate to this. When you are in a film crew for a class you don't always have the luxury of knowing your crew-mates that well. You can't predict their responses to certain circumstances. I found the acting very realistic in this case. I thought back to my own film crew in jaded L.A. I honestly don't think that we would have fared much better. Maybe the smug types who think otherwise could watch a *realistic* movie like ""The Haunting"" if they have such a hard time with this..."
"Dookie-6","Null","1","2","16 August 1999"," What ever happened to imagination?
","My, oh my, how tarnished we film goers must be in this enlightened age of overblown special effects and Hollywood's appeasement to the lowest common denominator.  The results seem to be a desensitized audience with the blurred expectations of a young child whose parents have everything to give. And give too much, they always do.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project takes us back to an era of filmmaking when the imagination of the audience is allowed to make its own conclusions. Rather than spoil the child with every imaginable cinema trick and digital nuance, we see him/her reading something like ""The Old Man in the Sea.""  Forget the endless amount of hype (which there was lots of it) and the fact that a $60,000 dollar budgeted film can gross over $100 million in a matter of weeks.  Forget about the attempted blurred line between reality and fiction that was imposed by the directors.  We all (or most of us) knew going in that this was fiction, but who cares?  Sit back and allow your own imagination to fill in the holes.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this fresh approach to filmmaking.  The set-up for the students as they convened in the beginning, getting ready for the trip, interviewing local residents, getting drunk in the hotel room, resembled so many other home videos that we've all seen at one point or another.  A good set-up, I thought, for what was to come.  Although Heather Donahue seemed to come off a bit like an ego-driven thespian, I found her characterization to be a warranted contrast against the technical personas of the other two actors.  You could say that she represented the spoiled child who in the end was stripped of all her privileges, only to expose a raw emotion that could only stem from pure terror.  The psychological breakdown of these characters was brilliant, and only in the sense that their decision making became severely impaired.  Their inability to make rational decisions only took them deeper into the forest and the unknown.  Having the camcorder running constantly was somewhat of a non-fiction buster, but without that you wouldn't have a movie.  And the sound editing, especially the background noises in the forest, we're exceptionally well done.  I found myself closing my eyes and trying to discern what those noises were, just as the characters were doing.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is a must see.  Can't wait to see it on video. I have a feeling it'll be even creepier!!"
"MikeT-9","Null","1","2","16 August 1999"," Original But Over-Hyped
","Add another over-hyped film to the worst batch of summer movies in recent memory. I just saw this movie, and I and the three other people I was with just didn't see the big deal. OK, it's like nothing I've ever seen before - granted. It's also like nothing I ever want to see again. I work in the video production business, so believe me, I was happy to see something like that on the big screen. I wanted to like it, but I didn't.<br/><br/>I guess if you're not expecting much, the BWP is something of an accomplishment, and I did think about the last scene for awhile after the film was over. But an hour and a half build-up for a few creepy seconds isn't worth my seven-fifty. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting buckets of blood and scary monsters. I think that's what sunk ""The Haunting"" - showing too much when you don't need too. But the fact that it all hinges on seeming real, when you know it isn't, works against it. OK - all movies are fake, but good ones seem real within their own worlds. Because this film tries to make you think it's ""real fear"" on screen, it somehow just seems all the more fake.<br/><br/>The BWP has been plugged as being the ""new face of horror"", or ""the scariest movie in years"", etc...well, it isn't. For being  a very non-traditional Hollywood movie, it ultimately suffers from the same studio-generated buzz that plagues most of the big blockbusters.<br/><br/>In other words, don't believe the hype."
"Druid-9","9","1","2","16 August 1999"," Don't buy the hype. Not scary -- CREEPY.
","People have been burned by the hype for this movie. Let me offer a couple of suggestions to possibly prevent that from happening to any new viewers.<br/><br/>1) Don't buy the hype. This is not the scariest movie ever made. In fact, there's not a single big scare in the entire movie. That doesn't mean it can't creep you out. There's something to be said for the painfully slow building of tension.<br/><br/>2) Use your imagination. Try to pretend it's real. (Possibly a small spoiler here) Things will not be spelled out for you. Don't expect special effects. That's part of its charm. As Hitchcock could tell you, what you never see is far more moving that what you can.<br/><br/>That's my advice. It's a great movie, but it's not the movie you've been hyped to believe it is."

The Book states the HEATHER, MIKE and JOSH Were the actual people that disappeared, which makes you wonder when you see them at an awards ceremony or doing an interview.  I could go more in depth but if you want my opinion write me! Second thing...THE MOVIE, the way it was produced you are to belive that THE 3 ILM STUDENTS are actually filming the documentry BUT they screwed up! Last scene, after mike get's knocked out!

"Reanna","7","1","2","15 August 1999"," It was different than most ""horror"" movies.
","I recently went and saw this film, and the only word I could think of to describe what I thought about it was that it was different.  I think that there is a big difference between scary and and gory.  I would catagorize this film as scary with a bit of comedy. It does give a good example of how you don't have to see a bunch of blood and guts to be scared.  Personally, I don't think that movies filled with blood and gore are not at all scary, I think there sick and disgusting.  I honestly found this film more funny than scary though. I think that all the hype around it was a bit much, but I do admit that if it weren't for all the hype I probably would have never seen it.  Finally, I probably would not pay to see it again, but it wasn't a waste of my money to see it once."
"BaltJack","10","1","2","15 August 1999"," The ultimate journey into darkness.
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is the ultimate journey into darkness. Unlike the typical Hollywood horror film, it isn't the pre-packaged, slick, glossy production that a ""Nightmare on Elm St."" or a ""Friday the 13th"" film is. It is a very unsettling film to watch, and even more unsettling to stomach. I have some words of warning for those that see ""The Blair Witch Project"": expect to be left shaking and trembling when that hour-and-a-half descent into Hell ends. In short: this film WILL scare the Hell out of you. Enough said."

I don't know what everyone was talking about saying this was such a scary movie. The whole Drew Barrymore phone call in Scream (until everything became a bloody mess) was more suspenseful and frightening. But 'Blair Witch' is okay and worth seeing as long as you don't mind not being scared."
"nitehawk-8","10","1","2","25 August 1999"," This movie broke all the rules...
","First of all, I would like to say to all the people who absolutely hated this movie and gave it a 1 out of 10, YOU HAVE NO VISION. Whoever you are... you have no creativity, and your mind is about as open as the gate to Area 51. But then again, we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? ;)<br/><br/>This movie broke all the rules. Those who went to see it expecting chainsaws and gore or things suddenly leaping out at people are in for a surprise. I'm not saying movies like the Alien series or Scream, etc., aren't good... Blair Witch just has a completely different way of scaring you. The movie starts out humorous, with three film students setting off to research and report on a legend in a small town, and slowly grows more ominous with each passing minute. If you are actually willing to really WATCH this movie (and not immediately brush it off because of its initial appearance), you'll end up feeling more subtly disturbed afterwards than you may have thought upon going in. Most of my friends, people that have pretty much seen everything, well.... Let's just say that the average psychological disturbance for them was at least 2 days without any sleep. Same for me. The person I went with is rarely scared by anything, and he was white as a sheet during the last half of the movie (I was afraid to drive home alone after it, too!). There were a few days at work where everyone was grouchy and miserable from lack of sleep (most of us had seen it around the same time), but it was a GOOD lack of sleep... ;)<br/><br/>So there. I've either convinced you into seeing it for its genius or scared you into NEVER seeing it (sorry)... And if I say any more, I'll totally ruin it for you!<br/><br/>Blair Witch should at least receive an award for Original Screenplay this year, if nothing else. Good luck Mr. Myrick and Mr. Sanchez, thanks for the adrenaline-filled ride! (10/10)"
"Johnson-4","Null","1","2","15 August 1999"," Best Film of the Summer (Warning: Minor Spoilers)
","The cast is wonderful in this film.  The only way a horror film can scare you is if they make you believe what is going on.  Alfred Hitchcock did that, and that is why he is the king of horror.  I am not comparing Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick to Hitchcock, but they did do a great job with their cast.  Heather Donahue plays, well, Heather Donahue.  Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams also play themselves.  I guess forty thousand dollars cannot buy you different names.  Or maybe it just added to the realism. Heather Donahue is great.  In a present day where leading ladies are hard to come by, Donahue takes the cake.  The problem with most women taking leading roles is that they cannot be believable, something this whole film is based on.  But, Donahue plays the role in stride.  Her character is the one making the documentary, getting help from Williams and Leonard.  She is demanding, hard nosed and the leader and I believed it.<br/><br/>Michael Williams plays his role terrifically as well.  When the film starts, you think he will be the minor character.  All he is there for is the sound.  Well, think again.  He lets his role flourish.  As the group of three meshes, his role standouts, which becomes much more important as the film roles on. Joshua Leonard plays the sort of, peace hippie who tries to keep everything under control.  Surprisingly, he is the first one to disappear. His role complements the others as well.  None of the cast stands out because they all give great performances and they all mesh.  Whatever egos they may have had were checked at the door because this cast is about getting the film done, not giving the best performance.  This makes their performances even better. The plot is the best part of this film.  Despite the great acting and realism, all horror films still need a scary plot.  This one is based on three filmmakers who want to make a documentary on the local legend of The Blair Witch.  I will not spoil too much, but lets just say that The Blair Witch is a person/creature who supposedly killed children years ago. Then, after interviewing a few locals, they head out into the woods. They start filming in the woods, finding places that are spoken of in the legend.  They are disappointed, but still film, looking for more answers. However, they soon find a portion of the woods littered with The Blair Witch ""symbol.""  This is where things start to go wrong.  They start hearing noises in their sleep; first everyone believes it could be an animal or some sort of prankster.  But, as they start to believe it could be The Blair Witch, we start to believe as well.  And as things progress, they lose such things as the map and Joshua.  That is about as far as I should go, but let me just say that when you see the ending, prepare for a haunting experience. Is there anything wrong with The Blair Witch Project?  Yes, but nothing major that holds it back from being a four star film.  The only flaws I saw in this film were with two things.  Mike kicks their map into the river, claiming it was not getting them anywhere.  At this point in the film, they are nowhere near crazy, which is why I do not believe this part.  The other flaw is nothing major and actually enhanced the experience for me.  But, for those of you who cannot stand shoddy camerawork (i.e. your home movies) then do not see this film.  The camera goes everywhere and even has times when the screen is completely black and all you hear are voices.  This added to the realism for myself, but might make other people just suffer motion sickness. Overall, this is the best film that I have seen this summer.  It has humor in the beginning and then progresses to have you believe the scenario. Then it blows your mind with an innovative and haunting ending.  And, ironically, it is a sharp contrast to the effects laden blockbusters that plague us every summer.  Fortunately, The Blair Witch Project was made with forty thousand dollars, plus a lot of heart, hard work and creativity. This makes it one of the best films of the summer and of the year."
"TheFishy","Null","1","2","15 August 1999"," People who hated it didn't understand it
","First of all, this movie requires close attention. The plot is pieced together very well and I find myself awake early hours imagining what exactly the Blair Witch was. Most of the horror of this movie doesn't come to you right away. This isn't something stupid and overpriced like ""The Haunting"" or ""The Mummy"". This is true, ""what the hell is that"" horror. You won't pee your pants in the theartre. But you will poop your pants trying to sleep at night. (Minor Spoilers) People didn't understand the piles of rocks they found (that was a fake grave), the stick figures (three victims and one hairy witch like described before by the woman), the reason they were being hunted (they walked into a witch burial ground and broke something), and last of all who was after them (the world will never know). (MINOR spoilers over). Now that you have some of this pieced together go see this film. I can admit it was overhyped. I can admit it has its flaws (jerky camera work, too much bitching at each other) but I can admit that this is one of the finer films i've seen this year. True imaginative horror with an excellent setup. Don't be expecting 100 million dollar eye candy and a horror like soundtrack. Just expect a indie class horror film. And a great film at that."
"Dr. Bill-2","10","1","2","15 August 1999"," Home Movies will never be the same!
","Well, I might as well add my name to the list of people with scorching opinions one way or the other about THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  Students in my various classes at Dowling College (Long Island) were pretty evenly divided down the middle--they either HATED the film with a passion or they LOVED it. I fall into the ""loved it"" category for a number of reasons.  (Actually, I think it's exciting that people can get so worked up over a movie.)<br/><br/>First, the home video / 8 mm format is truly intriguing, an original variation on the French ""cinema verite"" style of the early 60's (or what was called ""direct cinema"" here in America during the same era).  The viewer believes what he/she sees.  Not once do you think that something is being ""staged.""<br/><br/>Next, the acting is top notch.  The improvised scripting is superb. Having been on expeditions to the woods with young people, I was glad to see that people were talking the way REAL people talk.  I've heard complaints about the profanity; well, for better or worse, that's how lots of people talk in situations like this.  Indeed, it was that profane language that made me believe in what I was seeing.  (After teaching young people for over 25 years, I know that this is, whether some like it or not, ""real language."")<br/><br/>Finally, it's the building tension that grabs the viewer.  For anyone who's ever been lost in a strange, remote place, this film completely captures t he irrational terror that can overcome the most rational person.  If you've never experienced a situation like this, take it from a person who has--the sanest of people will start believing the most insane things, the slightest sound will truly become the unseen monster, and the darkness will become a suffocating terror that will traumatize you for years (JUST years, if you're lucky.)<br/><br/>My one complaint is with the media.  In telling readers/viewers too much about the film beforehand, a lot of the punch is taken out of the experience.  Whether you do or do not know that the documentary is or is not really a documentary doesn't ruin the film, but it does take the initial jolt out of the experience.<br/><br/>All in all, it was great seeing an original film that is both an homage to ""direct cinema"" and an exciting step forward.  It's one of those rare films whose style is so individual that other films like it will be called copy-cats."

","Negative comments about this film interest me, amuse me.  In most of them the errors are blatant, their diet of large budgets and pyrotechnic technology clearly shows, even when they steadfastly deny that influence. I find myself wondering what books they've read, in their past, where they garnered their sense of theme and character and plot regarding fiction in any medium. TBWP is a ground breaker on so many levels it's difficult to watch the film fairly if you are an informed viewer.  ""Scary as Hell"" means many things depending on your trip from then to now. Yes, it is scary, it is terrifying, if you can shred your way through the current standards of ""horror"" and film making. This isn't our usual drummer. This is a gut raw excursion into a piece of our collective psyche some of us have glibly missed as we moved from kid to adult. This movie may pass and be damn near absent from video shelves in a few years but I'll bet it will hold its timeless spell, that, like ""Night of the Living Dead"", most video stores will keep a copy or two because the movie has tapped something that might be difficult for words to keep but lingers in those secret and dark niches of ourselves. One mistake in the whole phenomena is the hype seemed to pitch a movie over ""there"", when the film was quite seriously anchored right ""here"". That, I think, was simply a marketing move. When people ask me if I've seen it, I say ""yes, twice so far"".  When they ask me if I recommend it I tell them I have embraced it in the ""top 5"" of my horror film closet but that I don't recommend it to anyone because there is nothing to compare it to.  There's no way to prep a first time viewer of the film. I think those having to decide how to market the film faced the same dilemma. Horror, languishing and withering in our full speed ahead culture, has snagged an unseen claw in the fabric of our times and gained a foothold. How history regards Blair Witch is up for grabs, but Hollywood, media, consumers and our culture will adjust their trajectory because of an obscure film made on a laughable budget that reminds us the first tale ever spun around a campfire was undoubtably a ghost story. We have reached the beginning of the end of the color splashed, audibly thunderous and visually garrish ""BOO!"". We happily swap it for a precisely and perfectly timed "" ... boo..."" Some may miss the point, find it benign rather that frightening, wrestle over the first person, real time excursion and cast its ""less is more"" philosophy against the current ""everything isn't enough"" cinematic appetites. But I find much solace knowing that this tiny film has settled itself into movie history, already a truth, alredy becoming an influence. Horror has turned a long overdue corner. Neat! How often is something to fear such a cause to smile."

","Although I'm sure that not many films could live up to the hype that this film has received, I was disappointed in the movie.  While the last 10 minutes were intense, I cannot believe that anyone could compare this movie to ""The Exorcist"", or even ""Scream"", as far as being a scary movie.  The movie was only about 90 minutes long, and was only mildly frightening for a few minutes.  I've seen many comments written about people sitting in their theater seats after the credits started rolling, and I must admit, I was one of them, trying to figure out how this movie had gotten past the first sold out week without having the word get out that it sucks!  MTV will be running this flick during the wee hours of the morning soon, so maybe the drunks that come in at 3am will turn on the TV and think that they're seeing a horror film.

Then as I was leaving the theater and driving home, I kept looking in my rear view mirror and checking the back seat.

While I won't claim to have felt particularly scared, I will say this movie has three excellent performances of people being terrified. But it's not a pretty sight.

It's a tragedy I think that this film managed to grab the byline ""Scariest film ever,"" because I think that really takes away from what this film is. Some films achieve greatness because they have great acting, great directing, a great script, or a great premise.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project completely twists the notions of acting and directing, works largely without anything resembling a traditional script, and though it does also a brilliant premise, what makes this film great is the groundbreaking originality of it's construction. A few films, Citizen Kane and Pulp Fiction come to mind, have changed the notion of what a film can be or should be, and how it should be made. The Blair Witch Project is one of those films."

The television itself was saying that it was a real story and everybody believed in what the television said. This movie will get nominated for many oscars specially for acting and most original.

","By far one of the most original concept for a movie, The Blair Witch Project is what any ""scary"" film should aspire to be.<br/><br/>While it is quite different from slasher movies like Scream or earlier productions such as the 'Friday the 13th' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series, I don't think this film is meant to be anything serious.<br/><br/>For what it is, though, it is incredibly well done. While the actors are far from experienced, each performance is believable. After all, it was meant to be an amateur video. Unless you are not very fond of anything described as suspense, horror or thriller, you are sure to be haunted by this movie. It's not incredibly scary, but it gives you a rather unpleasant feeling. Some images will probably stay in your mind for a while. This is the first film of the genre where you really can't guess the ending. It is not something you can cut into scenes to look at good vs. bad parts. Either you love it or you hate it.<br/><br/>It really was a project, an experience in cinematography...and I think it deserves all the praise."

","Man, I'm never gonna forget this movie. I've seen it twice and will probably check it out again before it leaves theaters. I agree with the person who says it's more like a tragedy, not a horror movie. It reminded me of those news stories you hear about people disappearing and then turning up later, dead. I felt like this movie portrayed the hopelessness and fear that people in those situations must feel. There wasn't a moment that I didn't feel like I was there, along with the characters, feeling all their emotions. I thought the improvisational acting was outstanding, and I appreciated not being handed my ""scares"" on a platter; instead, the movie asks that you use your own imagination to make the movie work. This is by far the most original and unforgettable film I've seen all year."
"Andyh74","Null","1","2","14 August 1999"," Pseudo-Horror?
","I somewhat liked the film because, even though I read various things about the ""documentary,"" I still wanted to see it to see exactly what happened to Heather, Josh, and Mike on film.  I watched with some anticipation, wondering if the title subject was going to appear so that there was some payoff to seeing something other that three lost people in the woods.  It was enjoyable in that it's sort of cinema verite, kind of ""here it is, this is what happened, it doesn't have to make sense since we're out filming our first documentary,"" while at the same time it strives to be a horror film. It's caught between realism and fantasy, and I think that if one's imagination is tossed into the mix, then weird stuff comes out.  At one point I started thinking that maybe Heather was annoying for a reason, and I started wondering if she was part of the myth, had something to do with the witch, and realizing it now I see what effect the film had.  It presents itself as a documentary, but while watching it, I was thinking about one of the characters in terms of fantasy, that she (Heather) was in a fictional film, and so my imagination started posing questions that I felt would be answered if I kept watching.  And that's how the film kept my attention. If the film had a noticeable plot, the plot would be evidence of someone else's imagination, and then our emotional response would be the only thing we would express--we wouldn't ask any questions about what will happen. However, this film just presents itself--with our understanding of how it ends--and makes our imaginations ask questions, which in turn force us to be attentive to the film to get answers for those questions.  The film doesn't want us to take it seriously, because if we do, then we don't enjoy it out of dissatisfaction--we want to believe that it's either a film presenting itself as a documentary, or that it's a fictional film, that it can't be both.  It is that dilemma that I feel makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" unique."

Though not readily seen, 'South Park' shows the true level of hypocracy of the establishment, while 'Blair Witch' is truly a landmark of its genre, like the original 'Star Wars' or 'Pulp Fiction'.

They go to the grocery store, they joke around, they stock up on supplies. As they realize they're lost, the tension among the three grows apparent. The swearing increases.

","While I really enjoyed watching The Blair Witch Project, the experience would have been far better in an empty theatre. To become completely absorbed in the events on screen, there really needs to be utter silence in the theatre.  Unfortunately, crowds in Baltimore haven't totally mastered the art of staying quiet during a film.  That said, Blair Witch works much better if you take the events onscreen as factual.  Actually, even knowing that it is fictional does not detract from the experience too much, but it's certainly far more frightening if taken as reality.  <br/><br/>In some sense, the movie reminded me of Michael Powell's masterpiece Peeping Tom, made in the early sixties.  Both films were far more frightening in a psychologically realistic way than in a gore/shock way.  Blair Witch seemed as much a consideration of how we view films as an out and out horror film. It's quite short, and upon the fairly abrupt ending (which was perfectly fine by me), many people in the theatre said quite loudly, ""That's IT?!?"" Granted, it's impossible to escape idiots in society, but I would still highly recommend the film, only in a far more empty (or mature) theatre than the one in which I saw it."

","After hearing all the (what I now believe to be) hype about this movie, I was very excited to see the preview.  While the movie was very inventive and very creepy at times, it's definitely a case of the whole being *less* than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>The story line, about the recovered video of three college film students lost in the woods while doing a documentary on local supernatural happenings, is inventive and provides plenty of goose-bump inducing moments. The three main actors all do an *excellent* job, and each scene in and of itself is interesting.  However, just because a scene is well done doesn't stop it from being repetitive, and too many scenes rehash something an earlier one has already covered.<br/><br/>The video, both hand-held and 16mm show the students increasingly getting on each others nerves as it becomes clear they are lost, and documents their terror each night when they hear unexplained sounds (and eventually more) in the woods around them.  But there's only so many times I want to see them all losing it and yelling at each other.  The strength of the movie is in the eerie nighttime scenes, and we could have used less of daytime bickering and more of what the movie excelled at.  However each of these nighttime scenes didn't quite go far enough.  They were always chilling, but never truly frightening.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because the mystery of what is happening, and what is going to happen is at the heart of this film. Suffice it to say that I was expecting more at the end than I got.  The last scene had me gripping the arms of my chair, absolutely riveted.  And then it ended.  Abruptly.  I think I can appreciate why the film's creators did the ending in the manner they did, but I was left wanting more.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, the film doesn't draw together, it doesn't cohere in the way it needs to, and that is why its individual scenes, wonderful in and of themselves, don't quite create as wonderful a movie in total."

","I've read a lot of reviews for the film, some of the ""scariest movie ever made"" sort, and some of the ""I can't believe I paid $7.00 for this garbage"". The truth is that neither sort of review is accurate. What is accurate is that your psychological makeup and the way you perceive the world will determine how you view this film. In other words, you can be as terrified by Blair Witch as you allow yourself to be.<br/><br/>The film is all about the fear of the dark, the fear of the unknown, and the way we deal with the unknown in our mentality. Are you the kind of person who is scared of walking down the steps in the dark after seeing a scary movie on TV? The movie will terrify you. If you're not this kind of person, you may not like it.<br/><br/>The thing really annoying is the reviews here I've read which state things like ""why didn't they just light a bonfire"", ""if you keep walking in one direction you would have gotten out of there"", etc. You people are missing the point entirely. In the film, they had walked 15 hours in one direction, and wound up at the same place. There was nothing wrong with the three hikers, there was a supernatural force hanging over the proceedings. They were in a kind of ""twilight zone"" where time and space no longer had meaning. This was what was terrifying about the film; coming to that point where nothing makes sense anymore, where reality is just a memory. It's that loss of control over your own life and your surroundings that is the most terrifying thing to experience, and that's the message of the film. And you people are waiting for witches or chainsaws or something. Open your mind."

""Breakdown of Unit Cohesion"" is what the military calls it, I believe.  The infighting, the head games, the acts of rebellion all struck me as very real and very disturbing.  You just know the minute the guys start questioning Heather (and the minute Heather starts lying to them about whether they are lost) that the group is doomed.  I liked the way each character changed as they reacted to the stress of the situation.  It seemed rather surprising that Mike, who starts out as a total jerk, seems to be the only one with any kind of strength left right up until the ending.<br/><br/>Not only a scary movie, but an interesting study in the psychology of groups under stress."

","Not many movies mess with your mind the way Blair Witch Project did.  We have seen recently an increase in special effects and visual effects to scare, thrill and entertain us.  Gone are the days of an actual PLOT or STORY doing those things.  Alfred Hitchcock was the master and this movie reminded me of him.  Since you never see the Blair Witch your imagination is left to fill in the blanks.  I sat there in the theatre and was totally freaked out by the fact that they were being hunted and hadn't the slightest clue as to what was following them around. I mean the noises alone would have driven me mad.  I believe this movie will do to camping, what Psycho did to showers."

","Few films come along which actively invite viewer participation. This is especially true for the horror/fantasy genre which, in this age of overblown computer-generated fx, assault the audience with noise, gore and the likes of JarJar Binks. Filmakers of insight--and the makers of Blair Witch Project obviously fall into this category--know that the imagination can conjure up far more frightening scenarios than all the fx houses put together. After all, each of us has our own deeply personal, often subconscious, fears--which are seldom those of the filmakers. (Or, should I say, some Hollywood committee's idea of what is frightening.)<br/><br/>Darkness--literal and that symbolic darkness which represents the unknown--is an effective element of Blair Witch; and the use of handheld cameras gives the ""documentary"" an authenticity that no amount of slick, dollar-heavy Hollywood production values could create.

","This is probably the best horror movie I have ever seen -- and I've seen quite a few.  (In fact, a rewatched The Birds a few weeks ago, which, until now, was my favorite horror film.)  The documentary style is clever; it moves the story along and helps us see things through the characters eyes. The tension builds from nothing to extreme.  The fear it arouses comes entirely from that tension -- we never see what is out there, and there are no cheap scares from sudden surprises.<br/><br/>I found this film to be totally engrossing.  My impression, moreover, is that everyone else in the full theater felt the same way.  I don't know if I've ever been in a movie theater that was so quite during and after a film.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect of this experience for me (like someone else who posted comments here) is that it actually left me feeling queasy.  I think that was because of the jerky cameras.  But this is not intended to be criticism -- doing the film in fake, amateur style was great; it's just a warning that you might not want to eat a lot before or during the movie."

","In any given horror movie, there's the hero, there's the heroine, and then there's The Expendibles. You know the ones I mean: the goofy sidekick, the Bad Girl, the bully who gets knocked off by the REAL threat in the last act... you know who they are, and the order in which they will be slaughtered. And you probably don't care. Occasionally one of the Good Guys gets knocked off, and that's supposed to be shocking, or innovative.<br/><br/>Horsepucky.<br/><br/>One of the strongest reactions I had during The Blair Witch Project was a growing sense of disgust for almost every other recent horror film I've seen. Hey -- I went to school with plenty of people like Heather, obnoxious artiste types who blather about the Lacanian interpretation of the Flintstones over decaf espresso. Yes, she's annoying. But she's more recognizably human than the stock characters that usually pop up in horror films. I recognize her, and I wish she would shut up, but I care what happens to her. And I'm grateful to the filmmakers for giving us slightly annoying, unpredictable characters, who frequently don't do what you'd expect them to, or what they _ought_ to do to advance the plot.<br/><br/>I think one of the major reasons for the commercial and critical success of this movie is its complete rejection of formula. Marketing alone is not enough to ensure success! Think about it: who ever would have thought a virtually scriptless movie, shot by neophytes with hand-held cameras, could earn the acclaim (and revenues) it has? Yet here it is: with over a thousand comments, and some truly emotional responses pro and con.<br/><br/>At a time when Hollywood seems committed to remaking every film, TV show or SNL sketch, or adapting every novel ever written for the screen, here's little gem of a movie that doesn't do ANYTHING it's supposed to do. It doesn't play by the rules. Without professional cinematography, it still comes closer to a purely cinematic experience than anything you'll see this year... And there's something lurking, unseen but clearly felt, in the shadows around the edges of the film: brilliance. ...but if they make a stupid sequel, I'll sic a real witch on 'em..."

I villify Artisan Entertainment and the hype machine surrounding this movie, for making it out to be something it's not.  This is NOT a horror film, it's a psychological drama, about the unravelling of three friends as they trust and distrust each other in a dire situation WITH THE BACK DROP BEING the Blair Witch documentary.  That's why the film isn't that scary.  However, the last five minutes are definitely tour de force creepy and had me going. This is not Hollywood moviemaking and should be viewed by only those who can get past the non-Hollywood feel.  This year's PULP FICTION, this year's CHASING AMY, this year's USUAL SUSPECTS.

"RonB-4","Null","1","2","21 August 1999"," It's so scary because it's so real
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a damn scary movie! The premise: three student film makers go into the woods to shoot a documentary on a witch legend, then disappear. Their footage is found months later and this film consists entirely of that footage. The making of this movie is nearly as interesting as the movie itself. The two guys behind this film, made for just a few thousand bucks, didn't so much write and direct it as conceive it. They gave their three actors a broad outline of the story and two cameras, which the actors used to actually shoot all the footage themselves. The movie looks amateurish because it is, but that only adds to the horror. We see the three characters start out as cocky college kids, but wind up as terrified, cowering animals, hunted by something in the woods. What we never quite find out.  In this day of computer generated monsters it's nice to see a horror movie where not everything is shown. The fact that we often must listen intently while looking at a dark screen or shaky, out-of-focus camera work only makes it more real. Our imaginations are engaged. This movie is something like Orson Welles' great ""War of the Worlds"" radio stunt.  Cool, scary stuff if you allow yourself to get into it."
"HarryC","9","1","2","11 August 1999"," Flawed, but brilliantly spooky
","I used to review books and movies professionally, so I hope my comments will add a few fresh perspectives.  First, let me say that it's obvious that this is not the kind of movie that everyone will like.  People biased against seeing horror films won't; people who want technical perfection in the filmmaking process won't; people who want an airtight and tightly wound plot won't.  And I agree that the film has its problems - lots of gratuitous profanity, a tendency to drag about two-thirds through, and some plot points that aren't entirely clear.  For example, I didn't tie in how some of the residents' brief comments in the beginning affected the movie's ending (and various other events).  But they do impact it.  Maybe I just need to be hit over the head, but I didn't get it the first time around.<br/><br/>All that said:  I love ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Took me two viewings to really appreciate it.  The first time, I found it fascinating -- and the second time, I found it scary, especially when I ""got"" the ending. Scariest movie ever?  No.  But for a combination of scary and interestingly done, it scores big points.<br/><br/>Unlike some reviewers, I found the acting very realistic.  Some of the negative reviews I've read cite problems:  The actors wouldn't have done this or that, usually.  One reviewer said student filmmakers are very savvy these days, and the filming wouldn't have been that rough around the edges. He said this totally spoiled the movie for him.  Lighten up -- all fiction, and especially horror fiction, requires suspension of disbelief.  Horror films are notorious for having plot holes, unlikely things happening, and people going where they shouldn't.  In fact, in a lot of horror flicks, if people acted realistically there would be no plot!  And obviously fake studio-lot trees and dry-ice ""fog"" certainly didn't keep ""The Wolf Man"" from being a horror classic, at least not for me.<br/><br/>I also disagree that finding out how the film was made or that it isn't a true story make it a lesser experience.  Sure didn't for me.   And I'm glad to see some other comments here that tell me I'm not the only one with the ""hangover"" effect -- it ran across my mind for days after I saw it.  By the nature of its filming, Blair Witch gets a little vague in its plot sometimes, but it more than makes up for this with its freshness and genuine thrills.<br/><br/>I also appreciate the intricate Internet and TV framework of mythology -- what negative reviewers call ""hype"" -- that's been built up around the movie.  There's talk of a sequel.  Personally, I'd like to see a ""prequel"" built around the Blair Witch mythology created on the film's home page and in the Sci-Fi special, ""Curse of the Blair Witch.""<br/><br/>All in all, I'd rate this right up there with ""The Exorcist"" and the original version of ""The Haunting"" as the best of the post-1960 horror films.  Although each has its own special brand of horror, each keeps its place well secured in my memory.  As to those who are disappointed that they didn't ""see the witch"" or needed some presence to scare them, blame modern horror cinema for spoiling them with special effects and gore.  Those who don't like the film for these reasons would never ""get"" a classic ghost story."

Don't worry, I won't give it away. I have been listening to the local radio stations say the movie is overhyped and that it's hard to watch and not believable... I personally feel that they are saying it b/c they don't know what else to say, they left the theater b/c they were so afraid, LOL.  The lack of special effects and documentary style of filming is what makes this movie so special.  The filmmakers allow us to use our minds, and that in turn allows the movie to be frightening to everyone, not just those who are scared of blood and guts (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, etc.)  Overall I can honestly say that this was just about the most enjoyable, and frightening movie going experiences I have ever had... I would recommend it to anyone that is looking to be scared out of their pants!"

","When a film comes along with this much pre-release buzz it's difficult to go into the theatre without SOME kind of preconceived notion about what it is and what it's supposed to do. After seeing it, my feeling is that it was a very good film, using a concept that hasn't been done to death and one that served the filmmakers well. Let's hope, however, that this will not now become the cinematic wave of the future. We don't need every bunch of amateurs in the world running around with camcorders doing pseudo-cinema verite documentaries and foisting them on the public!<br/><br/>The appeal of 'BWP' to me was not as The World's Scariest Movie but rather as an examination of what stress and fear can do do people in adverse and extraordinary circumstances. Looking at it this way I think it succeeded admirably. One of my favorite moments in the film comes when the two young men almost get hysterical when they find they've been tramping through the woods all day and have arrived at the place they started. Heather, the filmmaker, repeatedly assures them that they haven't, then out of their hearing breaks down crying, confessing to herself that in fact they are back where they began.<br/><br/>The idea to suggest frightening sights rather than to show them was a good one that works well. There was one point, though, when Heather was running in fear and screams ""What the **** is that!"" that I thought they could have at least shown a shadowy suggestion of SOMETHING. But I can't criticize the direction the filmmakers took, because it worked. I think they made the film they set out to do. A masterful job was done of building suspense throughout the entire movie and the climax occurs right at the very last moment, like the best Edgar Allan Poe stories. Hype and expectations aside, I thought 'The Blair Witch Project' succeeded on its own terms."

","Days after seeing the Blair Witch Project and its come to me that my recollections of the movie seem like it was something that happened in a dream. This was a nightmare, there are several scenes in Blair Witch that are comparable to the way a dream would carry out. It also carried with it a sense of infinite realism, just like the way everything in a nightmare would seem real in its context, the movie had me in that same zone. Everything was real and I was right there with the characters terrified at what was going to pop up around every tree they crossed in those woods.  Blair Witch had me weirded out, I came out of the theatre totally dis-orientated. Over the past week my friends and I have been tossing theories, clues, and interpretations around - every time I feel the hair stand up on my arms. For me it was how it seemed like a nightmare that captivates me, for others I've talked to its other aspects of the movie - all of which are exciting. Blair Witch Project is so out there because it is so in here, in our minds, it has captured a part of my mind untapped by any movie I've seen before it. It's incredible that a movie could have made me think like this, Blair Witch Project is truly an experience unlike any other."

The majority of the film is during the daylight hours when they're just walking through the woods and the parts shot at night are filled with nothing more than twigs, leaves, screaming, and ""scary voices/noises"" that you can't hear but supposedly the actors can.  To top the pathetic theater experience off, the shaky camera work caused such motion sickness that I had to leave the movie towards the end and vomit 5 times in the movie theater bathroom.  I don't think ANY movie should cause you to toss your cookies because of the ""cinematography""... and I use that term loosely in this case.  According to my fiance' I didn't miss much.

","The early IMDb ratings for Blair Witch and the user comments were all enthusiastic and genuine. Then the media came along. Artisan claimed credit for everything (the website was better when Ed did it. At least the pictures loaded and the hyperlinks worked, which is more than I can say now...) the actors jumped in, and Dan and Ed began to look like mindless opportunists. Comments from viewers now are surprisingly negative..<br/><br/>Well, God never intended everyone to see a movie like Blair Witch, just as not everyone should see Clerks, or Z (lo, these many years ago) or Dark City. We all enjoy different things, and some people really would prefer to see Runaway Bride, or The Thomas Crown Affair, or The Haunting, or Inspector Gadget.<br/><br/>So, if some people are disappointed after seeing Blair, perhaps the hype and buzz did overcome the really brilliant little indie film and in doing so made it seem more universal than it is. That is unfortunate. However, I recently read that Hollywood insiders feel that hype on the Internet made Blair a hit, and that is unjust and false.<br/><br/>Blair Witch is archetypal. It is what frightens you when you are babysitting at a strange house, in the woods. It is why you understand expressions like ""things that go bump in the night."" The Blair Witch Project is brilliant. Say all you want about Artisan, or the Internet, or buzz and hype. Artisan didn't make Blair. Heather and Mike and Josh didn't either.<br/><br/>Dan and Ed did.

They actually got me to see this piece of crap, and I gotta tip my hat. Now for the movie itself...<br/><br/>It's a cool idea. The legend, the cocky naive kids, the ""cinema verite"" techniques, etc. Hey, I Wanted to see this thing. But it all comes apart in the execution. There are a host of problems, many noted here by others, but for me the biggest problem is that the movie makers didn't give me a reason to care about the characters or what happened to them. Donahue is an annoying brat, which would be fine, except that's *all* she is; the other two characters barely register at all. And they're so stupid! I'm willing to suspend my disbelief somewhat for the purpose of the movie, so I tolerated the otherwise non-sensical dragging around and constant use of the cameras. But these three pinheads walk into the woods without any idea of what they're doing. Umm, anybody know how to follow a watershed downstream? Read a map? Bring a cellphone? Mark a trail? This ain't rocket science.<br/><br/>For me the movie basically ended when Mike admitted that he threw the map away. There's no reason given for him to commit such a spectacularly stupid act, and there's no justification for it except to advance the plot and let them all say f*ck another 40 times each. At that point I was just hoping that the supposedly terrifying presence lurking just offscreen would spring forth to devour the three knuckleheads posthaste in order to keep them out of the gene pool and permit me to do something productive with what remained of my evening.<br/><br/>What bothered me more than anything was the laziness this evidenced. Glaring weaknesses in structure like this are not that hard to work around -- why not have them find the map torn to bits and stuck in one of those hanging stick figures? At least that would have made *some* sense. If the directors had put half as much thought into the actual movie as they did in marketing it, it might have been decent.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I have to go watch some paint dry.<br/><br/>Evidence of the success of this hype (aside from the fact that it snatched $7 from my pocket) is the persistent belief on the part of some yahoos out there that this is based on actual events. Can someone please, please get these people a life! For myself, I walked into the theatre believing the film was actually going to be entertaining. As H.L.

I must admit that I had a chuckle at the thought that someone decided to kick a piece of paper but do not expect me to blithely swallow the idea that this girl is any type of researcher.  The entire premise of the movie is that three ""researcher"" are looking into the legendary Blair Witch, however time and time again, these ""researchers"" simply ignore all of the hints and out-and-out revelations that the locals make about the Blair Witch.<br/><br/>In two different instances, the first by Mary Brown the other by the two Fly fishermen, about the cabin in the woods. Imagine my surprise when at the end Heather and Mike find a cabin in the woods. Oooooooooh, how eerie.<br/><br/>Earlier in the film, while Heather is in the cemetery, she speculates if the Blair Witch is responsible for the disappearance of the seven children in the 1940's. Even after the fishermen tell her about what really happened to the children, after they tell her about the cabin where their bodies were found, Heather and the team do NOTHING. This was so frustrating. What type of research is this?<br/><br/>Okay, one last irritating bit, back to the fishermen, the manic that killed the children, kidnapped them in PAIRS, so why were only SEVEN children killed? Maybe the whole concept of the ""pair"" is different in Maryland, but I don't thank so.<br/><br/>I was expecting so much more, this movie was the biggest waste of $9.00 I have ever spent.  This movie was a monumental waste of my time.<br/><br/>If anyone ever doubted the infinite power of the hype machine, this movie is evidence that it is alive and well in Hollywood.

Imagine reading a book--you put yourself into the story; you find yourself as one of the actors in it. Then, you go to see the movie.  The movies are never as good as the books they are made from because they tell you what to think instead of letting you think for yourself.  This movie is a book on screen.  You become one of the filmmakers.  You feel their exhaustion, their anger, their fear.  I loved it.  I let my imagination run with this movie, and believe me, it took off.

","Blair Witch is a great show that succeeds despite its problems.<br/><br/>Problems: The hand-held camera jostles irritatingly in the opening, but that allows you to better ignore the subdued bouncing that is often present later in the film.  Probably the dumbest thing in the film is that the film-makers always keep shooting film or video.  Personally, I would have been more impressed if most of the shots were less carefully framed, shot from the hip as it were, suggesting that the camera was being used more as a light source than as a recorder of events.  While I was able to suspend disbelief *while I watched*, the thought of all that running around (without tripping) while a camera is plastered to one's eye boggles the mind.  I was also p***ed that the trio mentioned following a stream but decided instead to completely rely on their obviously non-functional compass.<br/><br/>Succeeds: All that aside, I loved this show (nine out of ten).  Woods don't scare me.  Lost in the woods doesn't scare me.  The woods at night doesn't scare me.  But oooooo I'd be scared if it went on for days and nights and days and nights and something/someone maybe? was stalking me.  I've been too tired to think straight.  I can empathise.  Ever see ""Things to do in Denver when you're Dead""  Remember the guy who decides to stay awake several days, waiting for the assassin?  That's the last half hour of Blair Witch.  I was expecting the trio to turn on each other at any moment.  And Heather? Loved her acting.  First time I can remember an actress allowing her voice to break while screaming -- it's bad for your voice, hurts, and pretty well nobody does it.  But it sounds so much more authentic.  That's the neat thing about this film -- it feels authentic.  I believed in these people. I was glad when the film ended.  I was tired of being scared."

","Ok, tell me this wasn't the most irritating, grating flick you've ever seen.  It claims to be scary, it isn't. It claims to be worthy of wide spread cinematic distri bution, it isn't.  This poor excuse for a horror film is nothing more than a hodge podge collection of shaking images and scenes of 3 bellowing collegians who try to add drama to their film by uttering the f-word or one of its derivatives like every two words.  Oh yeah, and the word 'man' too.  The acting is just plain awful.  And talk about repetitive.  Every night they'd go to bed in that tent.  They'd hear noises while in the tent.  Then they'd wake up and find some dumb collection of twigs or voodoo dolls outside of their tent.  This happened every night for what, five nights.  Predictable and a real yawn....where's Kubrick when you need him.  And, to borrow a little dialogue from the film, 'what the f**k' did they all eat? I want to know cuz Josh, Mike, and Heather were stuck yelling and scrambling around in the woods for 5 days and seemed to pass the brink of emotional and physical exhaustion (maybe from all that yelling?) yet rarely exhibited any signs of real hunger except for the standard uttering of 'i'm cold, tired, and hungry and want to go home' about once every half hour. Call me bitter but i'm tired of the mainstream media hype machine putting all us suckers in a tizzy over yet another lame film. They did it with Austin Powers II.  They did it with this horrible film (that's right, not 'horror' film, but 'horrible' film).  For all those reading this who are luckily still in their pre-Blair Witch state, DON'T go see it.  Or, for a cheap substitute, just go to a drunken frat party to hear all the yelling and uttering of the f-word that you want."

The last 20 minutes of the movie had my heart pounding, and my mind wondering, ""what is gonna happen next?""

So when i finely got to see the movie Saturday August 7  I had very high expectations. The theater was packed and bursting with nervous anticipation. I watched with hypnotic amazement and as the film came to it's chilling end I felt a feeling of relief mixed with disappointment. There were so many people expressing their thoughts on the ending at once I missed the horror of it. But as soon as someone next to be mentioned what the ending was about i realized just how terrifying it was. Until then I didn't think the film was frightening at all. That night when I got home the mental haunting began. I have not been able to get it out of my head for days now. I must go see it again. I do think that people need to be able to get the ending. I have read so many people think it is something it is not. Please if you have not seen the movie pay attention in the beginning of the movie and use your imagination.

"KTfarrelly","10","1","2","9 August 1999"," An excellently horrifying thriller
","A lot of the people I saw Blair Witch Project with had never learned or had any experience with voodoo or witchcraft.  I think that those people were seriously shorted of an excellent movie.<br/><br/>I loved how the directors used a subjective point of view throughout the film... it really brings the audience into the plot.  It hasn't been used for a long time, and it was very natural.<br/><br/>I don't think that the movie gave enough information about the spells and meanings of some of the symbols in the movie however. There are short shots of particular objects and writing that are not really explained.  Giving the audience the background information about the power or meaning of each object the characters find would have significantly changed the reaction of the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is one of the best horrors I have ever seen. To anyone who is even remotely interested in seeing this movie, do so in the theaters... it won't be as good on video with the subjective point of view. Before you go, soak up some voodoo/witchcraft information.  Your experience will be 75% more satisfying."

","The only movie I've ever seen that was so bad I was actually p***ed off at the end. The whole thing is an amateur documentary that three teenagers made with a home video camera. Really, there is absolutely no real cinematography in the entire flick. Furthermore, there was no action at all. Not once did you see or hear more than some clicks in the night and some bloody teeth or something outside their tent in the morning. And really that was the only part that seemed like a horror, but since it was filmed so shakily and cheaply, even that part wasn't at all scary or interesting. I could have made this ""movie"" with a couple of my friends. It was straight out of MTV's ""Real World"" watching them all bickering and swearing at each other. Every night it was the same BS. One ""scene"" where they're all scared cause they hear noises. Not at all scary. Not at all entertaining. It's a home video. Every lousy thing you see is shot through one of their two camcorders. And THAT is the movie! It was an interesting tale, but it has no business being in theaters; it belongs in the ""film-maker's"" bedrooms to show off to their college buddies. Leave the real films to real film-makers."
"sorrow","10","1","2","9 August 1999"," Comments to potential viewers and disappointed viewers
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the best movies to come along this year for many reasons. It features some of the best acting that I have seen in a long time, is shot creatively, and presents thoroughly believable characters in a story that is character driven. Plus, this film manages to truly get under the skin, providing a creepy and tense emotional experience.<br/><br/>Now here are some things that this movie does NOT offer:<br/><br/><ul><li>Unnecessary state-of-the-art special effects</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Scripted dialogues (neither the kind that are too stale and poorly written to be believable nor the kind that are too well-crafted or clever to seem real)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Verbal masturbation by actors (i.e. - overacting, show-off acting, or any kind of acting not necessary to successfully portray a character)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cheap-thrills</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gratuitous sex</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gratuitous violence</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cardboard characters in a pre-packaged plot device</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Happy endings with ""closure""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Spoon-fed entertainment with no thought or feeling</li></ul><br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the above list is what the average movie viewer wants, and when a film comes along that doesn't give them any such gratification, they tend to get lost.<br/><br/>When one watches this movie or ANY movie for that fact, one should try to experience the film. Be there with the characters. That means no talking to your neighbor, no asking aloud what just happened (as if someone else _knows_ the answer), and no stepping outside of the film to sit safely in your chair. Concentrate on the events unfolding before you and give yourself over to what is precious about art: an emotional experience.<br/><br/>If you let yourself go with this film, it _will_ work its magic on you.<br/><br/>Does that mean you will jump out of your seat or get spooked?<br/><br/>Doubtfully, though some people may. Most likely you will not have that kind of reaction - that is the fun roller-coaster kind of fear that audiences have come to expect from entertainment. This film is about real fear - the kind of disturbing emotional experience that comes from watching three individuals slowly transform into hysterical animals afraid of being trapped in a situation that is beyond their control.<br/><br/>Why does it work? Not because of the fear of what's not on the screen, as many reviewers like to say. No, it works because - when you let yourself go with the film - the actors don't seem like actors performing for your entertainment; they seem like real individuals grappling with a horrifying situation.<br/><br/>Anyone who gripes about why the filmmakers continue to film or why they do this or that is just actively trying to fault the film or isn't paying attention. Such a person is on some level resisting the experience of allowing himself to go with a very real and creepy film. The film explains that Heather is a film junkie who films everything compulsively. There are plenty of people who do this on trips. In addition, the film reveals that documenting everything is Heather's way of coping with a horrible situation.<br/><br/>At several moments when it may seem silly to the third-party viewer that the cameras are still rolling, one must bare in mind that just because the camera is on doesn't mean that the cameraman is actively filming the events. The operator could have simply forgotten about the camera.<br/><br/>Think about it: if you were filming something and were suddenly scared half-to-death, you wouldn't stop and turn the camera off; you would simply run, and that's exactly what happens in this film in many cases.<br/><br/>At other times, the filmmakers continue filming in order to hold on to some sense of order in the chaos that has engulfed their reality. They are clinging desperately to one of the last remnants of the normal and modern world from which they have been separated by the increasingly menacing woods.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" is an intelligent and inventive film that demonstrates what filmmaking is all about: an emotional experience. When a viewer goes in merely expecting something safe and entertaining, he will be sorely disappointed by ""The Blair Witch Project"". Such a case is sad, for the viewer who allows himself to go with this film will experience a truly disturbing and rewarding piece of art."

","I thought this was a really original horror movie.  I had trouble deciding if it should be considered a movie or a prank.  When you watch this movie, you feel involved with the characters because they act so naturally. Afterwards i thought that it would be an ultimate prank to show your friends, if they somehow didn't hear all of the hype.  It's the kind of movie that would be fun to watch by yourself or invite a bunch of friends over for a scare.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the fact that the horror is all in your mind. There are no graphic images, no special effects, and no murders shown on camera.  What makes the movie scary is the way that the cast convinces you that they are truly scared and confused."
"diva-24","10","1","2","9 August 1999"," I haven't lost this much sleep since the Exorcist -- may include spoilers!
","This is, without a doubt, one of the must terrifying films that I have seen in my young lifetime. Never before in a film has the intent has been so deliberately to cause fear - no disgust or revulsion, like in the Freddy movies for example. This film is about pure, undiluted fear, and that is what makes it so fabulous. Lately movies seem to operate on a gross-out factor, depending upon expensive special effects and gut wrenching visuals to have the viewer experience some sort of terror. The terror in the Blair Witch Project, however, is more primevial, more psychological, more spiritual. The fear of the unknown is the greatest fear of all -- and the makers of this film and the actors portray that so well. For me, the most terrifying part of the film was when the sides of the tent began to be pushed in by an unseen entity, and children's laughter could be heard outside. The gut reaction of the actors matched that of my own, as did their reactions in the rest of the film. This is another brillant measure of the film...any one of us could have been in the same situation and acted just the same. To create that sort of empathy for the actors allowed the viewers to experience the terror of the film even more. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who was scared in the shower the next day -- I was waiting for the shower curtain to be pushed in on me. The climax of the film, though, I must admit, first struck me as being ""cheesy"" until about 30 seconds later. The un-knowing is the most terrifying part. Not since Hitchcock have inuendo and implications created such terror. The only problem I have seen with this film is that it is an 'all or none' kind of thing. Either you get it, or you don't. That I find unfortunate for those people who have lost the ability to use their imagination to create the monster in their mind and require Industrial Light and Magic to do it for them. The monster in your mind is so much more chilling than any designed by computers -- especially when the monster in your mind is something unseen.(10)"

I'm happy for those of you who liked the film, but for me it was pure torture (not even a good ""this is terrible"" laugh).

My favorite part of the movie is never seeing anything, as that lets your imagination run wild with you.  I thought that the acting in The Blair Witch Project was top-notch, especially Heather Donahue's confession scene.  The little use of blood and gore, the acting and just the fact that it cost and estimated $50,000 makes this movie well worth $4.50.  I'd like to see it once again, just to understand it better, after reading so many things about it and everything.

I too was lucky enough to see a screening of this film, and I can honostly say, it is the scariest, creepiest, most unsettling movie I've seen in years, if not ever.<br/><br/>Having been a fan of Stephen King stories (although not necessarily the movies) for as long as I can remember, I have come to love the feeling of being afraid of the unknown, the unseen; letting your imagination run away with your sense of reality.  Mr. King has a way of painting a picture of things dark and demonic that makes your skin crawl.<br/><br/>This movie goes WAY beyond that.  The movie in and of itself is nothing more than a terrifying glimpse into our own deep, dark minds, the place where our imaginations tell us there is something hiding in the closet when reality tells us there just isn't anything there.<br/><br/>Don't expect flashy special effects, gory bloodbaths, or hideous monsters in the Blair Witch Project, the monsters in this movie are the fear of the unknown, the unseen.  Watching Heather, Josh, and Michael track the Blair Witch, you can't help but sympathize with them, empathize with them, fear for them.  The reality with which the movie is presented only makes your imagination work faster.<br/><br/>Then, the hair on your body stands up from head to toe; and it won't go down for some time after leaving the theater.<br/><br/>Don't miss this movie; and don't watch it alone."

When I went to see it everyone in the audience moaned after the movie was finished, most likely disgusted with the ending. I'm sure this was only so because people have grown accustomed to blood and guts and goo - the physical aspects of horror. ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't bother to utilize the physical elements, but rather take a different approach which appears much classier and to me makes the film come out better than any other horror film could. If you would like to see a classy, extremely well done horror film that will leave you dreaming nightmares for a fortnight, you should definitely see this movie. If you want to view a cheesy, unintelligent, gruesome horror film that would basically have the same effect - stay away from this movie. The choice is yours. I give it an 8 out of 10."

I did not find it particularly frightening, but it was still very disturbing.  Unlike most movies, scary or not, I found myself thinking and talking about it for weeks afterwards. The film has a number of unresolved and unexplained elements to it; while some people find these exasperating, I enjoy revisiting these little puzzles.  This is perhaps one of the most true-to-life characteristics of ""Blair Witch"" - it is not artificially tidy and neat, but has that perplexing raggedness in the details that we recognize in real life."
"Ike-18","10","1","2","8 August 1999"," The nightmare of Poe...
","The Blair Witch Project is the most terrifying movie I have ever seen, if not the most horrifying movie ever made.  To try to describe in words such as soul-mortifying, heart-stopping, mind-paralyzing, would not do it justice.  It is something you must experience.  Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't already seen it, but I am going to give you a few tips so you can better enjoy the movie.  First, it is essential that you listen to every bit of dialogue in the movie, especially the town interviews, otherwise you are not going to understand why the ending is so insanely frightening.  Second, go to this movie expecting to be scared and wanting to become part of the movie.  If you go trying to prove to everyone that you were not scared by the Blair Witch, then you'll do it, you won't be scared, and you'll have missed the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy a truly awesome movie.  The Blair Witch Project is sheer creative genius. And the way it is filmed, although possible borrowed from other films, just adds to the complete madness.  It becomes all too real as we watch the decent into the malstorm of Heather, Josh, and Mike.  And the ending...well folks let's just say that I nearly deficated on myself right there in theatre. My girlfriend thought I was going to rip her arm off, I thought she was going to crush my fingers, and my heart thought it was going to rupture. Intense is not the word.  This movie is the nightmare of Edgar Allan freaking Poe or whoever else you want to compare it to.  And what makes it work is that you never know quite what's going on.  Stephen King once said in his book Danse Macbre that our imaginations are darker than any horror movie could envision.  That although we might be scared by something in a movie, it could have always been worse in our imagination.  Well, that's what makes this movie so flippin' freaky.  You are lead through a series of horrifying events where you are just as confused as the victimes and the climax is so viscious because you have been drug to the darkest corner of your soul and then......you're left there, forced to peer into the inky blackness and left with your mind writhing with fear, branded with the last scene like a hot iron.  ""Scary as Hell,"" as one critic said, may just be the understatement of the year."
"bsmaurer","10","1","2","8 August 1999"," Ignorant People Just Won't Get It
","Dear Harsh Critics of the Blair-Witch Project:<br/><br/>It sickens me to think of all the ignorant people out there complaining about the quality of the BWP video or the annoyance of the characters, because that is in essence what I like about the movie.  The movie makes no effort to be thrills OR chills. . . it just attempts to show you what would REALLY happen if gen-Xers went into the woods and experience what before was ONLY a legend firsthand.  I've heard people say ""Oh, how stupid do you have to be to get lost in the woods?"" and my reply to that is that they were never supposed to leave.  That was the whole point of it.  Supernaturality changes all dimensions of reality and this is what one has to expect.  So what if the characters broke down and cussed and were annoying--thats reality.  How many people can you claim to know who wouldn't freak out after four days in the woods and something attacking you every night?  Don't you realize that your cushy little suburban houses and apartments will give you nothing but reason to make fun of a camping venture?  I went out into the woods less than a week before seeing the movie, and I realize firsthand that all one needs to be scared is his or her own mind.  I went into the theatre to enjoy the movie, whereas most people went in to disprove a ""hyped movie."" This sickens me.  If you are determined to break apart a movie before you go in, then you will hate the movie.  But if you go in with the notion that maybe you might be able to enjoy this for its reality and creativity and simplicity, then who knows?  You may not act like a total *&#!head when you write your next review.  So from now on, I implore you to look away from the everyday explosions and guns and sex and instead look for a steadfast film which will challenge your mind and delve into the depths of the human soul and reality the way that the Blair Witch film did.  (And yes, I am an avid fan of Die Hard Movies)  But what really needs to happen lately is an awakening in the entertainment industry to challenge its viewers to think rather than be thought for, as the way it is these days.  If we disobey the norms of this ""Dawson's Creek/MTV"" era, then maybe we'll be a little bit more individualistic and real to ourselves rather than be just another name on a BIG MOVIE BOX OFFICE ticketholder.  Also, does anyone realize how bad the Titantic sucked but how good it became because of its hype?  It won best picture... err... bought best picture, when it had no business even being nominated!  It showed no real ingenuity other than the best special effects James Cameron's money can buy and yet everyone loved it, just because they were supposed to.  So I urge all of you Blair-Witch Nay-sayers to get off your asses and view this film as psychology and reality rather than spectre's and amateur video.  Its supposed to be amateur.  Its supposed to<br/><br/>be annoying.  But most importantly, its supposed to be real.  So enjoy this fact, this innovation rather than shoot it to the ground because it doesn't fit the norm of what Hollywood has conditioned us to think."

","Yes, this movie is VERY scary.  I don't frighten easily, but this movie bothered me unlike any film since ""Halloween"".  It manages to spook you with no gore, violence or things jumping out at you.  It just uses darkness and other things (I don't want to give anything away).  The acting is realistic and the dialogue sounds realistic (hard to believe it was all improvised). However, there's one HUGE problem with the film.  It's the jerky hand-held camera work.  By the end of the film, I was on the verge of throwing up! Imagine being on a rocking ship for an hour and a half straight...not a pleasant sensation.  The camera work does work for the film, but it's just very difficult to sit through without getting severe stomach cramps.

There is no doubt that a lot of people aren't going to like this movie, however.  I work at a movie theater and have talked to plenty of moviegoers who were disappointed.

Do not go see this movie if you are one of the following people:<br/><br/>-You consider ""Con Air"" and ""Armageddon"" to be the two greatest films of all time<br/><br/>-You are overly critical about films, and feel the need to nitpick details that really don't matter in the long run.<br/><br/>Remember, an open mind and a vivid imagination will make this an experience you will never forget."

","This wasn't exactly a very scary movie, in my opinion, although it did catch me once or twice.  It may have been the audience in the theatre that ruined it for me.  It's hard to be scared when the people in the theatre think that the whole thing is really funny, and the man sitting behind you specifically has a laugh like a braying donkey.  I am sure that had I been alone I would have been scared senseless.  As it is, the movie was damned creepy. <br/><br/>
I think the one thing that creeped me out the most was that child at the beginning.  The one that one of the people being interviewed is holding, remember her?  I want to know if the child was supposed to be saying 'No!' and covering her mother's mouth like that.  If so, get that kid into some classes immediately..she was a damned fine actress :) <br/><br/>

"punctate","10","1","2","10 August 1999"," A Cult Hit
","The Blair Witch Project is the latest cult film that claims to be the found footage of three missing filmmakers. Heather is making a documentary about the Blair Witch working with her is Josh and Mike. One the first day they go around interviewing people in the town. The next day it was off to the woods to shoot the documentary. The characters work well with each other at first. As time goes by the characters begin to argue when strange things are sighted like the piles of rocks. On the way back they don't seem to know quite where their heading. At night they are hearing weird sounds some of which sound like feet. This happens every night and each day the characters begin to breakdown. The scary thing about the movie is the fact at night we hear sounds but see nothing. The movie successfully keeps your heart pounding especially during the moments where the characters are panicking. The feel of the movie is real very real and that's what's also scary about it. The camera technology is cheap and that gives the film it's real life look. A great movie with a frightening ending. I give this movie 5/5. A very scary movie that is definitely worth checking out. Don't Go Into The Woods."

This film is NOT about the ""witch"", it is about being lost in the woods and the increasing paranoia and fear that result.  It's a slow building process.  By the second day in the woods, the ""witch"" is forgotten and the filmmakers focus on their own dread and fear.  THAT is what this film is about.  Not a ""witch"" that so many are disappointed that they didn't see.  Little do those folks know, they saw the true monster of the film, but are not perceptive enough to realize it.

","An exceptional movie! Do not go see this film if your definition of a good horror film is Scream or I know what you did last summer... you will be sorely disappointed. There is no real blood and gore, no sexy teenager with big bouncing boobs, and no special effects. Don't expect to jump out of your seat, it's not that kind of scary. The movie footage is jerky and bouncy at times but that is part of the magic. If you have a good imagination and aren't as dumb as a rock you will really enjoy this movie. It scared the bejesus out of me. Now for some tips for viewing this movie: 1. Don't sit in the front row. The film can be a little nauseating due to the motion of the cameras. 2. Go to a matinee to see it, less idiots. 3. Pay close attention during the first of the movie... Especially to the interviews with the locals so that you can clue in on the legend. This is essential to totally ""get"" the ending. 4. The first 20 minutes or so are a little slow but pay attention.

Who doesn't know someone (or is someone) who goes outside with a flashlight to check out a strange noise?

The only thing scary about it is contemplating being stuck ANYWHERE with these 3 losers.  If you even consider the possibility that this incident really happened, the world is a better place to live without Heather, Mike and Josh.  Consider that they are surrounded in dry, dead tree leaves, smoking cigarettes, and screaming at each other about how lost they are.  Light a damn  signal fire and someone will come and rescue you!  I think you can hear the sound of small airplanes overhead during the film, and I am expected to believe that these 3 college students can't figure out that they should signal them?<br/><br/>I was expecting something like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" from this film.

I saw it at a free preview in Portland, and the entire audience was held spellbound, dead silent during the final five minutes of this movie.<br/><br/>If your idea of a scary movie is Jason hacking at someone with a garden weasel, then skip ""Blair Witch."" You will be disappointed. Go see ""I still know what you screamed about the summer before last"" or whatever the current dead-coed movie is called, because that's probably more your speed. If you prefer subtle horror that doesn't shove dead bodies in your face, splash blood all over the camera lens, or rely on a shrieking string section for suspense, then you will probably like ""Blair Witch Project.""<br/><br/>In other films, technical crudity is a negative. In this, the unsteady camera, the uncertain delivery, variable film stock, etc. all help make the movie more believable. The characters are all believable and sympathetic, and the horror goes on almost entirely in the audience's minds. The last five minutes are, like the rest of the film, devoid of blood, SFX, music and monsters and yet are, unquestionably the scariest five minutes I've ever spent inside a theater.<br/><br/>As the release date approaches and the buzz builds, I see ""Blair Witch"" as being the biggest sleeper of the year. Kudos to the filmmakers, and to those fans who have been promoting it all these months. Go see this movie, or the Blair Witch will get you :)"

","Independently-produced thriller filmed on videotape concerning 3 student filmmakers making a documentary about the haunted woods near their Maryland homes.

","The concept for ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great and original one. The hand-held, amateur, documentary, camera-work must give the viewers a realistic view of the events and tend to make the viewer believe that all of this really happened. It makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" an highly original one of a kind movie. Never again will there be a movie like this one.<br/><br/>Most of the time the movie has a good realistic feeling and atmosphere. At times you really have the feeling that you're really present in the woods, together with the three main characters. Most of the lines and moments are obviously improvised however when scripted moments and lines occur, it becomes painfully obvious that none of the three main actors are good actors by any means. It takes away lots of the realism and because of that the good original concept is flawed. It's also flawed because it is highly unbelievable that the three main characters kept filming that much and even at the moments when they were in peril and scared.<br/><br/>I do applaud this movie for its originality but it simply was not as good as I expected and hoped it would be. To be honest I was even bored at times while watching this movie and it takes a lot to make me bored while watching a movie. It simply took forever at times for something to happen.

It's the only explanation I have for the phenomenal worldwide success of a horror film in which stick figures and tiny piles of stones are considered to be the stuff of nightmares?<br/><br/>Whilst I am, of course, fully aware that big sticks and stones can break your bones (as the childhood saying goes), inanimate small pieces of rock and the lesser of branches hold no real fear for me. As a result, I didn't find The Blair Witch Project anywhere near as frightening as the millions who are afflicted by Stickstonophobia (surprisingly, I could find no official scientific term for this widespread condition, so I coined this one myself!).<br/><br/>Admittedly, I did find some of the strange noises that occurred during the night fairly creepy (after all, they might have been made by big spiders), and the way that the film-makers were unable to find their way back to their car was unsettling (I've lost my bearings in the woods myself, and this brought back bad memories), but the ending—when Heather and Mike enter the dilapidated old house at the end of the film—was simply frustrating: surely everyone knows that derelict houses are deathtraps.<br/><br/>Sure enough, both characters lose their footing on the obviously rotten floors and die.

Even during daytime, thinking about this movie in the middle of the woods makes my heart beat faster. But does that make the movie any good?<br/><br/>One of the positive things I can say about The Blair Witch Project is that it doesn't rely on jump scares, meaningless gore or silly characters like Freddy Krueger or Jason. It shows that it's possible to scare people without cheap tricks. There's also no unnecessary nudity, or any graphic sex scenes in it (the language is bad, though).<br/><br/>The worst thing about the movie is that it's meaningless. We're just watching a bunch of people get lost in the woods, where they are finally killed off by something supernatural. We're not left with any hope when the incredibly scary credits roll.<br/><br/>I guess the movie could serve as a terrifying warning against playing with the occult or paganism, but I can't really recommend it.

Take a leap of faith& belief and delve into this movie. With out the overpowering effects and music score most movies rely on to scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.<br/><br/>Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no deoxyribonucleic acid altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. A guaranteed cult classic, Blair Witch has Heather, Mike, and Josh heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills. For most of the film, it is very unclear. The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are experiencing the supernatural, being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople, or just completely out of their minds.<br/><br/>If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing.<br/><br/>Many have complained about the shaky camera, the cussing, how no scenes really happen, and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not that shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why they are tromping through the woods and they are scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing the lines were improvised, the actors are college age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student.<br/><br/>At a time when digital techniques can show us almost anything, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't see. The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark. Any kid can tell you that. Not that he believes it at the time."

","I recently re-watched this with my teenage kids. They enjoyed it, a bit, but it's difficult to explain to them just what an impact this ""home video"" blockbuster made on the pre-YouTube film-making world when it first came out. And I can't say for sure how much of my attraction to it has to do with nostalgia (I saw it while on a date, in an indie theater so long time ago). The instability of the camera work still makes my wife sick, after all of these years. Aside from the novelty of its lo-fi, homemade film style (in 1999, anyways), the acting was fairly strong. Had it not been, I suspect that this film would never have made it out the gate. The storyline is decent, the assemblage of different characters is fun, and there's a reasonable balance of action and introspection. What's missing? According to my son, the witch herself. In our current age of ""top 5 carcrash"" styled YouTube lists and 720p jumpscares, the lack of a visible boogeyman proved too anticlimactic for his taste. Maybe I'll re-watch in another 20 years, and let you know what I think."

","A masterpiece, to put it simply, and one of the most influential and iconic horror movies of all time. It's a disturbing film without any violence or any monsters.<br/><br/>The naturalism of the actors is unrivaled. It's impossible to overstate how compelling each performance is. Our main character is a joy to behold in every scene, with the perfect tone and expression to accompany every word of dialog. Every minute she wasn't in frame speaking into the camera was a minute I wished she were. I could not imagine a better performance.<br/><br/>The recurring sense of ""dread"" as each night falls, and the slow escalation of the threat, followed by the sudden release of tension at dawn, puts the viewer through an ordeal that you share with the characters. The film perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in the woods. The panic, the anxiety, and how easy it is to get turned around. On one of the final nights as the sun is setting, you can hear the desperation in Heather's voice as they know what's coming and are powerless to stop it.<br/><br/>There couldn't have been a better ending. It's the stuff you don't see that makes this film so scary. Your own imagination is always more terrifying than anything on screen.<br/><br/>The movie had perfect timing and excellent marketing. Came out when the internet was still the Wild Wild West. It was pretty difficult to prove or disprove anything quickly and search engines were still pretty primitive. The studio took advantage of this and as a result the movie had a lot of buildup. I dont' think anyone will ever be able to recreate that type of marketing again. If you tried that today you would have blog posts, articles, videos, tweets, tearing every aspect apart."

","When this movie first came out it was cultural phenomenon. This was, I get it, since this is a pioneer found-footage genre movie. No one has actually done anything like it before. But what is the main principle of this kind of pictures? Realism. We have to believe it's true, the camera is not outside of the story, taping it - it's basically one of the characters.
Hence we get what we get - this genre was in fact very timely. Being just a way of cinematography language nowadays it's completely left its predecessor, its founder behind.
The Blair Witch Project could only be made twenty years ago, when it was possible to make it look credible enough for us, viewers, even if just for a second to believe that this all might have actually been true (or forget it couldn't). It helped that the actors were all no-names and the Internet was long way from where it is now.
Of course if you look close enough and are picky enough you'll find tons of inconsistencies, but we have to treat it for what it is - cultural phenomenon."

","TBWP polarises people and rightly so. The ""cheapness"" of the movie captures the tech available at the time and this shouldn't be a problem except it is to a generation of kids growing up with HD quality everything. Also to truly 'get' this movie you had to watch the movie around the time of release, there was a lot of really good fake promo plugging the film under the guise of news reports and documentary shorts. This was before the era of fake news, so it worked. So before watching this movie you really need to appreciate the time, the tech and the mentality of a 90s kid going in to see this. The Internet was just about working end of the 90s and there wasn't a great deal you were doing back then apart from sports, shopping and exploring places. This is why Blair witch hits home, for 90s kids all we had was exploring stuff and we couldn't even take decent pictures of it. I'm a pretty hardened horror fan but that end scene of the movie messed me up. It was great everything surrounding the movie was great, so before trying to pull this to pieces on an intellectual movie scholar level just remember if you aren't from that era you just aren't gonna get it."

It isn't typical horror by any means and it does take great risk in doing something new. But this attempt proved to be quiet effective. <br/><br/>Perhaps this film might have been more scary in the movie theaters but watching it at home creates a difficult environment to become scared in. There were never any moments that made me even the slightest bit startled, the film played more onto the realistic factor of horror, things that make you uncomfortable and nervous.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is outstanding, some of the best I've seen in a while, never stale, never artificial. I think that's what makes this movie so great.

"taylorcabral","9","1","3","17 June 2017"," Frightening And Unsettling
","I'll be honest: the first time I watched this movie, I wasn't even able to get through the first half hour of it due to boredom. Because of this, I didn't think it would scare me when I decided to give it another chance. However, as the movie began to intensify and the paranoia of the characters began to settle in, I finally realized what made this movie so unsettling. Basically, a bunch of students venture out into the woods to film a documentary on the Blair Witch (after interviewing various folks about their thoughts/opinions on/experiences with the mysterious figure). Things soon begin to go awry in the group as they realize that they've lost their way out of the woods. Odd and creepy things begin to occur, adding to the fears of the characters. And that's what makes this movie so creepy and unsettling: the complete and utter vulnerability of it all. What makes this movie scarier than the Paranormal Activity movies (another found footage film) is the fact that these students are in the middle of nowhere. They don't know their way and they even seem to be going in circles every time they attempt to escape the woods and find the car. I felt the fear that the characters were feeling; I was immersed in the movie, which really doesn't happen to me much in horror/thriller movies. The grainy imagery and shaky camera-work adds to the sensation, making it seem like footage from a rugged, armature-ish documentary. Now, the reason why I gave this film a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is because of the odd ending. It's not really a ""bad"" ending, I just feel like it could've been done differently. Although the movie takes awhile to get to the scary stuff, it contributes to the whole ""starts simple but gradually gets creepier"" vibe. 9/10 movie, definitely worth a watch."

","If you're a fan of horror movies then you absolutely must see this classic if you haven't already. In 1999 when this extremely low budget movie was released, it very quickly became a success, both with critics reviews and with the box office. It raked in over 140 million dollars. It was made for about 40 thousand dollars, it was literally all filmed by these three young people, this is the found footage category of horror films all began. We have the filmmakers of the Blair watch project to thank for movies like paranormal activity. I love scary movies like this! This is how you make an effective scary movies that actually scares viewers. Too many horror movies use buckets of fake blood, over the top effects, and show you exactly what you're supposed to be afraid of. This movie does none of those things, not a one of those tactics are exercised at any point. And not doing any of those things is what makes this film work and it's what made it so popular back in 1999. The performances by heather, mike, and josh are all so great, they're realistic and very believable. With this movie, if the performances by the three actors didn't work, then nothing would've worked at all because that's all it is. Seeing these actors reactions to the supposed horrors that are happening to them is what sends a chill up your spine. You hear one of the guys yelling for help at night and you hear far off creepy sounds. These things are effective because it's dark and you literally have no clue what it is you're supposed to be scared of. The stick figures hanging in the woods was a good touch too, it just added on to the eerie creepy factor. If you're going to watch a scary movie one night and you have yet to see this one, just give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed. And the ending is just the icing on the cake. It's done extremely well. 10/10!"

The best part of the film are the arguments these three assholes have with each other, tension rises as they get even more lost in the woods, you don't even need a witch to make this film unnerving.<br/><br/>For its style and techniques the film deserves all kinds of praise, I wont say that this is better than a big budget horror film, but its definitely worthy of recognition for the effort that these independent filmmakers put into the film.<br/><br/>Overall, the film may not be for everyone for its lack of real scares and explanation, but I don't think that it needs any more explanation, I think its better to leave it to the audience."

","As one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons of the last twenty years it feels odd to give a synopsis for ""The Blair Witch Project"". The reason being is that two different versions could be given, one where you talk about a documentary one where you talk about a fictional found footage film. As twenty years have passed I think it's pretty safe to assume anyone who's reading knows this is a fictional film disguised as a documentary from three student filmmakers who go into the woods near the town of Burketsville to investigate the legend of the Blair Witch, believed to haunt the woods.<br/><br/>Even at seventeen years from its release, even to someone like me who didn't see the film until late in the game after having seen other found footage films that used the medium to great effect (""Paranormal Activity"", ""Rec"", Chronicle""), ""The Blair Witch Project"" remains a gem of the horror genre, one of the best ever made, indicative of the fact that what truly scares us is what we don't understand.<br/><br/>To talk about this film is also to talk about the many stories that surround its making which represent the brilliance and the inspiration these filmmakers had for the production. It is a film that, even after all of these years, remains original, fresh, unique and most of all terrifying. It is one of those movies where you just don't believe how they made it, how they came up with certain ideas and techniques, the one where you just keep asking yourself questions throughout the whole duration and one that still lets you enjoy the joy of filmmaking and directing without ever calling attention to itself.<br/><br/>At the heart of this creepy madness are three performances that live on as remarkable efforts of acting and actor's direction. There isn't a false beat in these performances, there isn't a dull moment, you full heartily believe in these three characters, you appreciate them as fully rounder, three dimensional real people which is what ultimately makes this film the more terrifying. Again the stories of how the directors pulled these performances from the actors are fascinating and indicate how truly inspiring, great filmmaking from two individuals that had a clear, beautiful vision for this picture.<br/><br/>The characters manage to feel so alive and real that is where almost all of the horror takes place. In reality what we have as set-pieces are a couple of sounds, one iconic imagery and a final set-piece. Yet it feels like so much more. That is because of how insanely close you manage to get with the characters. The found footage trope was used to extreme brilliance here, it was dictated by story and manages to bring us into the world of these people as no other medium could have ever had. I mean you feel every drop of sweat, every breath and insanity the characters are put through, it is absolutely harrowing.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film also manages to have a thematic line and delves deeply into the realms of starving, desperation, getting lost and confronting yourself with death. All of this subtext it what actually makes the film as tension filled and scary as it is. The raw portrayal of this wears you out by the end and you have just the same will of these characters to get the f**k out of the woods.<br/><br/>As a big horror fan, as a true film fan, as a lover of the art of filmmaking and as an adrenaline junkie I cannot recommend ""The Blair Witch Project"" enough, turn off all your lights, put away all other electronic devices, make sure the screen is the only source of light surrounding you and experience this film in all of its glory, you will have a blast, it lives on as one of the scariest films ever made."

"MaximumMadness","10","1","3","2 September 2016"," ""The Blair Witch Project""- One of the most unnerving, exciting (and divisive) horror films of the past twenty years.
","""In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary...A year later their footage was found.""<br/><br/>...with those words, ""The Blair Witch Project""- one of the most successful independent films of all time, kicked off back in July of 1999. It was hailed by critics and became a worldwide phenomena, catapulting itself into legendary status in the world of horror almost instantly.<br/><br/>It was not only one of the pioneering films in the current wave of the found-footage sub-genre (which had existed since at least 1980's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but had never quite met with such public recognition), but also one of the earliest films to successfully implement a wildly successful web-based viral marketing campaign. It helped to sell the idea that this was more than a film- this was ""real."" People genuinely did not necessarily know that this was just a movie- the marketing made us question if this was real life footage, which only garnered more and more hype.<br/><br/>It became something more than a film... it was an event. A piece of history.<br/><br/>So, how does it hold up now, nearly 20 years later?<br/><br/>I'd say extremely well.<br/><br/>Yes, it is true that ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a somewhat divisive effect on audiences around the world. Horror has a way of dividing audiences in a way due to fear being a wholly subjective experience. But I do firmly believe that it is a masterpiece of horror, able to do so much with so little, while maintaining strong character, a compelling storyline and building a top-notch mythology that still has the power to stick with you long after the credits begin to roll.<br/><br/>We follow a trio of student filmmakers- Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard- as they travel to Burkittsville, Maryland to work on a documentary about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch."" However, their passion project soon gives way to absolute terror as they become lost in the woods, unable to find their way out, and mysterious events begin to plague them. It appears they are being followed by a mysterious force in the woods, which will stop at nothing to get them... And so, armed only with their wits and cameras to record the events plaguing them, they continue their journey, trying to escape the clutches of the evil that is pursuing them.<br/><br/>The biggest appeal of the film is that it very much does prey on the idea that what you don't see is oftentimes scarier than what you do see. The film makes a constant and consistent effort to build an absolute atmosphere of dread using only minimal tactics. Strange sounds in the distance... pitch-black darkness surrounding our characters... the appearance of mysterious piles of rocks and figures made of sticks. It's incredibly minimalist, and yet it is so darned effective. And when the film finally does move in for those jumps to punctuate the atmosphere, you're so enthralled that it rattles you right to the core.<br/><br/>The performances also help to elevate the material to its legendary heights. While it's key moments have been parodied to death in the ensuing years, it's hard not to connect with the characters. Particularly Heather, who despite her flaws, is still very much a person. When the film's iconic ""I'm so scared"" moments pops up (and that's not spoiling anything, it's one of the iconic images that the film was marketed by), your heart will be breaking while the hair on the back of your neck continues to stand with tension.<br/><br/>It really is without question that writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez struck gold with this film. It's become a pop- culture phenomena and to this day, is still aware and relevant to horror audiences.<br/><br/>While it's slow-build nature may turn off some movie fans, I cannot emphasize how much this film works and how important it is when viewing the history of film and horror.<br/><br/>It's easily a perfect 10 for me. Let's hope the upcoming 2016 follow-up is able to deliver even more of what made this film so magical!"

"Rendanlovell","8","1","3","2 August 2016"," A great found footage horror flick
","Now that we are getting a second sequel this year I finally decided to watch the OG 'Blair Witch Project'. Now that I've gotten around to it I'm glad I did. What's interesting about this film is that, even now, it remains one the most renowned horror movies ever. Yet, it's also the same movie that accrued a Razzie nomination for worst picture of the year. So which is it? Is it one of the greatest exercises in horror or one of the worst? In my humble opinion it's one the best. Although I wouldn't necessarily call it a horror. For my taste it's more of a thriller than anything. If you aren't aware, the film follows three young adults who venture into the woods in search of a story.<br/><br/>A story for their documentary. Which explains the reason for the found footage style. Before this movie there really wasn't anything like this. And with the viral marketing suggesting that it was a legit thing, people were genuinely frightened for the cast. Apparently sending letters to the cast families expressing their condolences for their losses.<br/><br/>Even with the excess of found footage films these days this one some how still feels fresh. This mainly has to do with the lack of gimmicks and clichés despite it revolutionizing a genre. There isn't any slow pan left and slow pan right followed by a jump scare. Nor is there the constant wonder as to why the characters have a camera at all times. <br/><br/>The reason it defined a genre is because it did it so well. And now all we have is overused troupes that intend on jumping their audience to death. The thing that genuinely shocked me while watching was how the film understood that less is more. There isn't a single jump scare that I remember and there isn't a single time that you actually see the antagonist. <br/><br/>The film understands that if it where to show the witch and sets rules for it that it would become vastly more difficult to scare you. By not having these rules set it can basically do what ever it wants without any one saying, ""That doesn't make sense."". It helps you as the audience feel and experience whats happening through the characters perspective. As more things start to happen and they start to question what is going to happen next, so do you.<br/><br/>This intentional lack of a monster or rules makes this incredibly unsettling to watch. It feels authentically supernatural. The performances by these three unknown actors really helped sell this even more. They aren't all that good honestly, but the writing and editing for the film made everything come across convincing and natural. Not everything here works though. <br/><br/>As I said, the performances can be quite shaky. They clearly aren't trained actors and some of their interactions can be rather cringy. But the biggest issue I have comes from some of the characters behavior. There are many times when they act so irrational that it's near impossible to not get frustrated at the film. Like when a character tosses a valuable object into a river just because he personally deemed it ""useless"".<br/><br/>However this film honestly shocked me. It blows me away how diversified its audience is when it comes to whether they liked it or not. It may not be that scary but it's incredibly unsettling. The film is unpredictable, natural, and uncommonly convincing. It isn't exactly a perfect horror experience due to some poor performances and questionable behavior, but it's such an interesting dive into human physique. Watching these people go completely bonkers was way more enjoyable, and unsettling than it should have been."

","""OK, here's your motivation. You're lost, you're angry in the woods, and no one is here to help you. There's a fu*king witch and she keeps leaving sh*t outside your door. There's no one here to help you! She left little trinkets, you fu*king took one of them, she ran after us. There's no one here to help you! We walked for 15 hours today, we ended up in the same place! There's no one here to help you, THAT'S your motivation! THAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION!"" - Josh Leonard (The Blair Witch Project)<br/><br/>I absolutely love this movie, I remember when I first saw it, I was 10 years old, I turned the lights off, I was terrified, and I couldn't get the movie out of my head.<br/><br/>This is a found footage movie (fake documentary) and you could say this one sparked the flame for how popular (depending on your perspective) they have become today. Ever since TBWP, I've been a sucker for found footage movies.<br/><br/>When the movie starts, it is a slow burner, and some people may become bored, however, everything you're seeing from the start is absolutely necessary. The movie builds the story slowly from the three main characters perspective, all they're doing is making a college documentary about a folklore in the small town of Burkittsville Maryland, they give the audience information (that is crucial later on) about the murders of 7 children, minimal info on The Blair Witch legend, the ritualistic murders at Coffin Rock, and the belief from the towns people that there's something evil lurking in the woods.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the three main characters performances, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams aren't just playing characters, they're projecting 90% of themselves into the movie. A majority of the actor's performances where real and genuine, they were really out there in the woods (not actually lost), they actually argued with each other, Heather shed real tears, and their fear was pretty legit.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes in the movie are: 1. Heather's Documentary Opening Cemetery Scene 2. The Interviewee's Story about the Rustin Parr murders 3. The description of the Coffin Rock Murders 4. Character's fighting about why the map was kicked into the creek 5. Discovery of Voodoo Stick Figures hanging on the trees 6. Night Time Chase 7. It's not the same log 8. Josh verbally abusing Heather 9. Cries for help heard in the distance during the night 10. Final Scene at Rustin Parr's house<br/><br/>TBWP is frightening, tense, haunting, eerie, and it builds and builds until the very last frame.<br/><br/>By the end, some people may feel disappointed because nothing is exactly clear, it's a bit ambiguous, and it's left up to people's interpretation. Clearly, there is something supernatural happening, but as an audience member, you don't find any real concrete evidence to support the fact that there is a ghostly or supernatural presence lurking in the woods, all of the happening can easily be debunked as, there are people screwing with them, and Josh did it; The Blair Witch is clearly the one responsible for the happenings, but you never see her, and that pisses a lot of people off.<br/><br/>I enjoy this movie because I get to use my imagination, I believe that the forces you can not see are the most threatening and entertaining for a horror movie. I love the abusive verbal behavior between the characters, it adds emotion, and empathy. The characters start off as happy go lucky individuals, they're very excited to go on this camping trip, but as the tension builds, they slowly start to verbally and physically tear each other apart, they break down and share real moments of fear, terror, turmoil, and sadness.<br/><br/>TBWP is not for everyone (clearly), but I enjoy it because it feels real, and the realer it feels, the scarier it becomes.<br/><br/>The movie could've been more of a character study mixed with horror, but I still enjoyed it for what it was, and that's pure unsympathetic non scripted non CGI-ed horror. <br/><br/>Final Grade: A"
"willcundallreview","8","1","3","16 December 2015"," Creepy stuff going on
","Horror is just one of those genres that get's a pretty bad wrap some days and it's not hard to see why, cruddy remakes, poor acting and sometimes they just feel so unreal they are horrible. Sometimes though horror's come along that not only satisfy those looking for a fright, but also those who watch all kind of films, The Blair Witch Project is exactly that. Of course it was applauded when it first came out for its new take on horror using the hand-held camera and also that it felt much more human than most horror movies that came out in the 90's. It's all about a legend that some kind of thing lives in the woods near Burkitsville (formerly Blair) in Maryland. A trio of students go to search the woods to make a documentary on the legend and well there footage was found a year later and the students have vanished.<br/><br/>The film is quite fantastic in the way it sets itself up, it doesn't try to jump into the end too fast and even with an 81 minute run time it never goes too quick. The plot is well crafted as well and the way in which it jumps between shots is good for the story to move along well and nicely, It can have it's periods where you might get frustrated at the pace but in general nearly overall it is timed well. Of course it isn't hard to get hand-held movies like this done on such a low budget and you can't expect much from this in terms of spectacular things but my word does it not need much of a budget. The creepy feel the people behind this give is spine tingling, never revealing anything properly and always the film uses the dark to great effect.<br/><br/>The people behind this are Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who direct and write this and do a fine job, sure everyone especially when it came out heralded the hand-held camera which is great but also these two get things like sound, colour and just generally the whole feel of the movie is spot on. Myrick and Sanchez create a script that has some nice dialogue too, it's the kind of dialogue that most horror movies need the stuff that actually sounds normal and not cheesy or lines that are way over dramatic. The cast are pretty solid too and of course being unknown it has the element of realism in there, of course after leaving the town and heading to the woods you only really see these three characters so the people playing them had to be picked just right and they are, they are likable and at the same time can be unlikeable and that really shows how the characters change as the plot goes along. <br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project isn't something I think all horror fans will like with it's hand-held feel and not a lot of horror that's right in your face, but it works mostly in it's way that is leaves you quite literally in the dark at times. It's spooky and there aren't many more words to describe this movie than that, even when things going on aren't necessarily creepy, you still look around those woods as if something will come out at any moment. In fact watching this I even got to looking into the woods from the very first second they step foot in them, as if expecting some sort of weird thing to come out any second, but if you haven't seen this, you will see what happens."

","It's likely that found footage films came before this movie.<br/><br/>However, I felt like this movie really paved the way for future FF films, and now we have hundreds out.<br/><br/>As for the movie I liked it.<br/><br/>I remember seeing this one at the theater, and I was young enough to buy into the hype that it might be real.<br/><br/>So I was glued to it and I was scared.<br/><br/>A lot of people hate this genre and type of film. They will say nothing ever happens and it's just ""annoying cameras jumping."" I suppose that's true. I think what makes this movie a success if my eyes is they built up the suspenseful moments without revealing anything.<br/><br/>That's the secret to successful FF films. You don't need a huge budget, big cast, or even great lines.<br/><br/>If you can build up the suspense, keep people anxiously watching, and keep the mystery thrilling/scary, you can achieve FF success.<br/><br/>And Blair Witch Project does all of the above. There's no real big payoff, but the movie will keep you at the edge of your seat and watching til the end. At least for me it did."
"jakc1995","9","1","3","7 June 2013"," My favorite horror film.
","This is one of those horror films that doesn't rely on using jump scares throughout it to make the audience leap from their seats in terror for a brief moment before settling down again. It is the kind of horror film that, once you've watched it, leaves a fear inside you, it makes you want to never go into a deep, dark forrest again. The Blair Witch Project is so terrific because it is so simple, one of the first ""found footage"" films in fact. It is true that people a more scared of what they can't see, while the blair witch is never seen in the film, her presence is made, which makes it all the more terrifying. The entire film is a suspense builder that does not end until the climax of the film, it keeps you glued to the screen, holding your breath. It is incredible how simply this movie is, yet how terrifying it is. I highly recommend this film to those who want to watch a good quality horror film on a dark and stormy night, you will not be disappointed."
"vip-danii","8","1","3","28 March 2013"," Could Be Worse...
","It's not one of the worst movies I've seen, but it really doesn't live up to the hype. Definitely overrated. Mildly entertaining at times, but also kind of boring on the whole.<br/><br/>Goes without saying that it's poorly-made, but that's to be expected from an independent film. Didn't really bother me anyway. ""Cloverfield"" was MUCH worse in that respect.<br/><br/>One good thing about it, was the fact that it's somewhat refreshing (if you compared it to your typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood slashers).<br/><br/>It was more or less suspenseful, I thought. I didn't find it one bit scary, but the suspense WAS present. There wasn't any gore or violence, which I appreciate. No cheap/stereotypical scares, either.<br/><br/>Another good thing, is what it wasn't predictable (unlike most Hollywood movies in this genre). You're not sure what's going to happen next and it keeps you watching. The movie kind of drags, but you're curious, which keeps you from falling asleep.<br/><br/>The acting was half-decent, but the girl was TERRIBLY annoying. She doesn't shut up for one second, and her obnoxious voice rings in your ears several hours after the movie has ended. Also, she over-acts (kind of like Sandra Bullock -- very annoying).<br/><br/>I think calling it a ""masterpiece"", as some people have, is a huge overstatement. It's very far from being a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth watching. There are LOTS of high-budget movies that are not half as good as this one."

","In October of 1994, three student filmmakers hike out to the woods of Blair, hoping to find evidence of a local legend ""The Blair Witch"".<br/><br/>At first, they find nothing except a pile of stones arranged by hand. As the sun goes down, they realise they are lost, but there is little panic.<br/><br/>They camp out, and in the middle of the night they see and hear things, things that are not normal.<br/><br/>When they awake, they find wooden dolls in cross-like formations. They were not there that night.<br/><br/>Then one of the students, Josh, is separated from the group.<br/><br/>The other two finally realise that they are in a very serious situation, and that they are being stalked, stalked by something that may be the very thing they were looking for...<br/><br/>I really do think that this is the mother of all found footage movies, and we wouldn't have films like 'Paranormal activity' and 'cloverfield' without it.<br/><br/>Yes, the last broadcast was made first, but which one has had the most recognition? which one pulled out all the stops in the marketing campaign? and most of all, which one is still as effective today as it was back then? The film works because it is simple. It's split in two, day and night. Daytime the audience is relatively safe because we just feel the despair of the group, but when the title card says 'night', thats when the dread kicks in and the film becomes something else.<br/><br/>Of course there are plot holes, such as 'when they lose the map, why don't they just rewind the footage because they have filmed the map?' or 'after all that time being lost, you come across a house, would you really go in?'.<br/><br/>These are all minor things, but other wise, this film is still as scary today as it was back in 1999, the performances are great, the sound is superb, and the overall feel of dread and despair etched on to the cast is excellent."
"Hey_Sweden","7","1","3","9 February 2012"," A good & creepy modern fright flick.
","""The Blair Witch Project"" can be seen as a movie along the lines of 1978's ""Halloween"": it may not be original stuff (think ""Cannibal Holocaust"", made approximately two decades before this movie, in this case), but it certainly popularized its particular sub genre, the ""found footage"" sub genre, for better and for worse. This marvel of marketing deserves its props for one main reason, and that's the way it uses its low, low budget to its advantage, placing all of its horrors squarely inside the heads of its viewers, forcing them to use their imaginations to conjure up their own demons. The story hardly needs summarizing by this point, but suffice it to say that it presents itself as the ""real"" footage of three student filmmakers who get lost in the wilderness of Maryland while investigating a local legend. What this viewer has to say, in his own personal experience, is that repeat viewings have helped him to appreciate it more than he used to. A large part of the appeal is the *very* rural setting, and the idea of being lost in this setting and having no idea where to go, possibly ending up going in circles, which would be an extremely distressing thought. Now, the largely improvised dialogue is no great shakes, but it does offer a realistic enough account of the way that humans under extreme stress may very well speak, alternating between sniping at each other and trying to bolster each others' spirits. Our three protagonists, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, aren't entirely unsympathetic. The directors slowly increase the sense of menace throughout, with the last act naturally registering as the creepiest. Interview sequences at the beginning are definitely amusing. The arts and crafts displayed by our unseen antagonist(s) are genuinely striking, and do lead to my favorite line in the film: ""Rednecks aren't this creative!"" Of course, the idea in this film of one character stubbornly insisting on documenting *everything* has already become a cliché; while of course we wouldn't have the movie if this person weren't doing so, it's all too easy to understand how this would annoy other people. Overall, I realize I have been under-rating this for years (watching it late at night or early in the morning with all the lights off would create the perfect effect) - it does have good atmosphere - although *that* scene has always cracked me up, and that was before I even saw ""Scary Movie"". In the end, it does appear that assessments of ""The Blair Witch Project"" usually do tend to rely on how one reacts - either it works for the viewer or it doesn't. Seven out of 10."
"brumblebrumble1","8","1","3","29 November 2011"," Frightening to every normal human being
","I must say it's amazing the huge number of negative reviews to this movie. They call it ""ridiculous"", ""poorly realized"", ""not frightening"", stuff like that. Well, I've got a challenge for all those extremely ""wise"" and ""all-experienced-in-horror-movies-and-cinema-making"" people. Why don't you all try go camping into the woods with your friends and watch this movie? Let's just see if in the end of the night you come here to IMDb bash on it and call it pathetic again? I highly doubt it because if you survive to that experience (like I did) without having a heart attack it will already be good. <br/><br/>The movie is good, it gets you involved! Every second feels like you're part of the story. And people complain about irritating and hysterical characters? For Christ sake, they got lost on the woods and were being haunted, of course they were loosing it! I am an experienced backpacker myself and believe me, you wouldn't want to get lost in the woods, much less hear and see strange things! I remember once when me and my buddies were camping and started to hear some weird noises and everybody was getting crazy ... So the movie is perfect under that point of view. Under such circumstances, everybody would loose control. <br/><br/>I think that people complaining about this are used to mega productions with super acting and directing technics and that kind of stuff. Under that prism, of course it is a very bad movie. The thing is, this flick was made to feel like it was a real thing happening to normal people and to put you on their eyes. That's the extraordinary thing of it and that's why it is so different of all the other movies! Every reaction seems like a reaction a normal person would take if it was on the same situation! Under that perspective, it was perfect.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you are expecting a super movie filled with great looking actors, a fabulous story line, Hollywood filming technics and that sort off stuff, don't see it, pop on your DVD anything of that Hollywood Zombie thrash that there is everywhere. On the other hand, if you are looking to get a huge thrill and to live a frightening episode like it was happening to you, then gather some friends on a country house and turn off the lights, believe me ... You. Will. Get. Scared!"

"ScottAmundsen","10","1","3","24 October 2010"," Real Terror on a Shoestring Budget
","Alfred Hitchcock may well have been the first filmmaker to demonstrate (with 1960's PSYCHO) that one could make a truly scary horror film for very little money and without throwing a lot of special effects at the screen. Few directors have learned the lesson Hitchcock taught; Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING is perhaps the best example.<br/><br/>THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a true original, takes the lessons of PSYCHO and milks them for all they are worth. Writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, showing a real grasp of the concept that less is more, put virtually nothing on the screen and yet in the process scared the hell out of audiences all across the country, myself included.<br/><br/>By now, probably the whole world knows the plot: three college students disappeared in the woods surrounding a town called Blair while doing a documentary film about the legend of the Blair Witch. Their film was discovered, though they were never found. What follows is a jerky, often repetitive, deliberately amateurish-looking film, made completely with hand-held cameras, which documents the three kids' adventure in the woods.<br/><br/>Woods are scary places by nature. After all, how many of the fairy tales that we heard as kids involved getting lost in the woods? Which is exactly what happens to Our Three Heroes.<br/><br/>The genius of this film, and the thing that connects it most strongly to Wise's THE HAUNTING, is that almost nothing is actually shown on the screen, and what little is, is either in the corner of the shot, or the camera moves away before the mind can take in what it has seen. Like Wise and Hitchcock, the filmmakers here created a work of perfect audience manipulation. The camera work, which with its jerks and tilts threatens to make one seasick, adds to a feeling that everything is off balance.<br/><br/>The three young actors deliver serviceable performances. That is to say, they are perfect for this film. It does not demand greatness; in fact, the cheesiness of the production values and the okay-but-not-great acting in a way add to the impact of this film.<br/><br/>I went to see this when it first came out. I went alone. It left me with a case of the creeps that took me weeks to shake. There were moments during the film when I realized I was absolutely terrified yet nothing was actually going on on the screen. I cannot explain the visceral reaction that this movie invokes; it has to be experienced.<br/><br/>TBWP will be on my top ten list of great horror movies for a long time to come."

","i recently was on vacation in Virginia with my family...staying at a cabin type house in the woods. there wasn't a whole lot to do, so in town one day i decided to buy a bunch of movies at a local thrift store. among the ones i bought...i ended up purchasing silence of the lambs, Hannibal rising, and Blair witch project ...having seen none of them but hearing about them from others.<br/><br/>i loved silence of the lambs, but really wasn't scared by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lecter. I enjoyed Hannibal rising, but the fictitiousness of it didn't make it frightening for me.<br/><br/>out of these 3 movies i was scared ONLY by the low budget, mock documentary about 3 college students looking for a witch. go figure.<br/><br/>the Blair witch project was unlike anything i have ever seen. the method by which it was shot created a feeling that these characters are just like any other college kid...you feel as if they could be people that you yourself know.<br/><br/>the dialogue was exceptionally genuine. even though i knew that the movie was not actually real life footage...i questioned that idea right up to the end. the fact that the story seems so authentic is what makes it scary. you do not just watch this movie...you're a part of it. it feels like it very well could be you looking through the video camera lens.<br/><br/>the terror that the kids feel from a combination of being lost, food running out, and a witch hunting them translates to the audience like you cant really imagine. sure, in some horror movies you're scared for the main character, but with this film you're almost scared for yourself, that you're in danger.<br/><br/>although this movie is not made of real life footage, i believe that no movie will ever be created that comes so close to reality as the Blair witch project does. if there was ever a movie that made people ""feel like they were in it,"" it is this movie."

It was only after the success of The Blair Witch Project in 1999 that The Last Broadcast gained much publicity, likely due to some similarities between the two films' plot lines.<br/><br/>The makers of The Blair Witch Project admitted to seeing The Last Broadcast before making their film during a 1999 interview with Diane Sawyer.

"Jacques98","7","1","3","10 October 2008"," A very intense movie for people who can appreciate what it tries to accomplish.
","Something that so much of the horror genre lacks is realism. While ""classics"" like A Nightmare on Elm Street do nothing but bash you over the head with a block of cheese, they get positive reviews because they follow the same tired, safe formula that make the horror fans go in their pants due to nostalgia. The majority of the horror genre isn't really scary, and it never was. When The Blair Witch Project first came out it was the only movie to break these rules and delve into true, realistic terror. It didn't follow a formula. It tried to recreate the terror of someone lost in the woods on film, without the cheese or eye candy. I think that is why it captivated me. I've seen thousands of movies in my life, the majority horror movies, and maybe less than 5% really scared me. I'm not sure The Blair Witch Project scared me, but, I can say I felt the terror in the characters and script more than the vast majority of the other horror movies I've seen combined.<br/><br/>But there is another factor it seems no one is mentioning in their reviews. If you've never been lost in the woods, as I've been many times, I'm not really sure you could appreciate or understand the fear that the characters were feeling. If you're not a camper, I really doubt you'd like this movie whatsoever. A lot of the negative reviews from people calling this ""stupid"" or ""boring"", I can understand if they've never been lost in the woods. This is NOT a film everyone will like, or should like, and that is something someone really needs to say.<br/><br/>Because I'm reviewing this in 2008, not 1999, I'm going to have to add that this movie is not like Cloverfield whatsoever. Cloverfield was a huge adventure caught on a small camera, while this is a small adventure caught on a small camera. If you liked Cloverfield (or vice versa) and are looking for a similar experience, this isn't it. They're both good movies, but for very different reasons.<br/><br/>The main flaw that a lot of people are having a problem with is the pacing, which is reasonably slow. The reason for this is because it is meant to echo real life, not bash you with an explosive beginning like is typical Hollywood. Some will find this boring. Some won't because they appreciate realism. I fit into the latter.<br/><br/>Overall, a very intense movie . . . if you know how to understand it. I found it very enjoyable and lacking of the typical horror cheese, which is something I can't say much anymore. Very much worth watching. You are not a real horror fan if you haven't at least viewed this once, because it's unlike anything that has ever been made before it.<br/><br/>3/10"

","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a movie within itself. This is really a real live horror movie in the making. Everything in it here is pure and simple. No make up, no extras, no crew, just documentary that's straight forward. It is surprising that a crew doing this project would disappear with a trace. Were the others too frighten to report? Or there's something real sinister about this project? It all took place somewhere in Maryland in 1994, and the film is found a year later. That girl in the video showed real fear. I mean it nearly frightened me too. Many documentaries have their own twists and turns. Some of them are real the rest were made up to fool the viewers. This one was no faker.

","I saw this recently and thought it was great. I have been tramping in New Zealand and been lost/taken the wrong way, and in a couple of other risky situations, and this film gets the antagonism you feel when, in your view, it is the other person's fault. It also gets the feel of going out with a bunch of people who may not be your closest friends, and who have their quirks, but you are with them for the journey and have to get along, sometimes under a little pressure. It also gets the way people without realising it overrate their ability and take the wrong option, yet because of the way groups work you can wind up on a path you wouldn't choose. In my country we don't have any scary animals and I don't feel scared of what might be out there, but people die every year in the bush from exposure/injury/drowning in rivers etc, this film makes that realistic fear and turns it into a supernatural one. I thought the acting was great, I was wrapped up in it, and because some of the things the characters were going through rang a bell for me it hooked me in and sold me once their fear started kicking in. I liked the whole idea of it too."

"cinemafiendee","10","1","3","7 April 2008"," The most perfect movie i have ever seen!
","The Blair Witch Project is in ways, more than a movie. At the time of its release, work was done in order to insure the most realistic feel the movie could have. using words like 'documentary' and providing documentaries of the kids and placing missing posters around Maryland were all tactful in making it feel like you are watching the final days of three people's lives. The director used interesting techniques in providing the authentic documentary feel. The three actors carried all the equipment and shot it all themselves. They improvised their lines, and were only told basic plot points by the director placing notes in test tubes so that only that particular actor could read it, and then reveal it to the other actors. The ending has been described as one of the best endings in a film of all time. This is all not to mention the effect of these techniques, which is unbelievably frightening at the right moment. This is a movie that is almost faultless as both a horror film and a mockumentary. Certain scenes are intensely disturbing and unforgettable such as when Heather finds Josh's teeth wrapped in a piece of his shirt and put in a bundle of sticks. Heather and Josh's reactions are the most disturbing element of the film. The director walked around them at night with friends and threw sticks and stones around the tent. This technique means that the frightened reactions of the kids are often genuine. It is because of this that you feel like you are there, discovering the trinkets left outside the tent for the first time also. don't be surprised if you start feeling stressed about getting out of the woods yourself. The end scene in which Josh stands facing against the wall while Heather is killed is tense and sickening and leaves you feeling regretful that you watched it, but if you wait, and think about 'The Blair Witch Project' you will discover its brilliance. Fantastic! P.S. The Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows is disgracefully bad in response."

","I'm sorry but the fact that there is no death, action or sighting of the Blair Witch really gives the movie no appeal. Sure, it's different and original but c'mon.<br/><br/>The unnecessary swearing, the poor lighting and camera work (the fact that the movie was meant to be shot by an amateur doesn't justify the quality of the camera work) just gives viewers another reason to dislike the movie and gives reason to cease watching.<br/><br/>The lack of action and substance in the first hour gives viewers a false sense that something will happen during the next half of the movie but what little action that does follow just disappoints. The whole map debacle I'd say is the high point of the movie and quite frankly I couldn't stand to hear the word map or another swear once more after 15 seconds into the argument.<br/><br/>The ending I don't even want to mention, pure disappointment... Barely anything happens and the existence of the Blair Witch is not proved nor does the ending make you think she is. It just induces confusion and stomach-sinking."
"ElijahCSkuggs","8","1","3","23 November 2007"," Revisiting after 8 years.
","And it's still a good flick. I saw this as soon as it came out. It was opening day, before it went nation-wide. We drove to downtown Cambridge to watch it at the Kendall Square Cinema. This is before the hype went out of control and when people were seriously confused if it was real or not. To those people, to this day, I still shake my head.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a movie that will go down in history as a classic. It's a time-less film that has aged very well. It's arguably one of the creepiest and most frightening movies of the past decade, and possibly all-time. It's a rare movie, that uses silence and barely any blood to get it's message across. I can't even remember the last movie to scare the masses in such a simple way.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with Blair Project was and still is the movie not showing even a hint of the Blair Witch. Watching the movie yesterday, I knew the ending so I was never really scared. But the movie still conjured up a few chills due to the dark woods and frantic situations. Just a glimpse would have made this movie so much more a hit. That is by far the biggest gripe about this movie. People feel cheated when things are happening, but nothing is really delivered. A glimpse at the end of feet floating across the camera on the ground, would have done wonders. But oh well.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a wonder of sorts. Only costing pocket change but making millions. Having unknown producers and actors, but still having the movie come off as real footage. Sure there are people who hated this movie, but overall the Blair Witch Project is a feat in the film industry that can never be denied. It's a film all horror fans should see and most likely all will sometime or another."

","I'm embarrassed to say I actually paid to see this garbage. Horrible. Why this movie garnished any positive reviews astounds me. The acting was putrid, but I suppose it was meant to be that way. Nothing like a wobbly camera and running around in circles to get my interest piqued. Then again there was the ""up the runny nose scene"". Great stuff. The story was boring and not the least bit scary. The only good part was the final few minutes, but sadly it was too little too late. The internet hype created this abomination and the fact Roger Ebert gave this thing 4 stars proves he'd lost it as a movie reviewer. If I ever fall for movie hype again, I couldn't be as disappointed as I was when I first viewed this piece of crap. I'd rather see a 24 hour marathon of ""Gigli"" than sit through another viewing of Blair Witch."

","Out of every horror film ever made, nothing has dug itself into my personal fears, to such and extent, as The Blair Witch Project. upon my first viewing i was aware that this documentary style horror film was entirely fiction, yet that didn't stop me from being genuinely frightened. It is a criminally underrated film, often critically snapped for being a giant cheap gimmick or scare tactic, also, the rather grim, terrifying and unrevealing conclusion left some disappointed. Yet having the mystery unrevealed is what makes this titles so compelling, what is hunting down these characters and why, what form does the presence take, what is the meaning of all these signs, rocks and symbols, it is this confusion that creates the claustrophobia and fear. that feeling of impending doom is maintained throughout the piece. The amateur actors are simply fantastic, applying Stanislavski method acting techniques to give their performances vivid realism. This film really has to be seen to be believed, just don't expect a blood bath, or an all out scare fest, this one is a pressure cooker of suspense, tension and claustrophobia, its a slow builder and requires a patient viewer.<br/><br/>Verdict: Masterpiece"

With pretty much nothing to work with other than a great deal of talent these folks turned out a really wonderful piece of work. Given all of that this flick has no real downside for me. Its well put together, the plot is a very good one, the whole thing flows well, and Heather Donahue in particular shines. This became an instant favorite for me. I like the way the whole thing is handled. The scene sequences and how they're done work particularly well. The movie comes off in a very natural way. Its exactly what I would expect to happen if that sort of thing happened. Which makes its believable while you're into it. These folks set a standard here. Now no budget is no excuse for no quality. No quality reflects only a lack of imagination or talent. And there is PLENTY of both involved in ""The Blair Witch Project""."

","I was around maybe about 12 or 13 when I saw the Blair Witch project and I didn't hear too much from it. But gosh, this movie was just a knock in the head or something. This movie is really different, it's not your Freddy or Jason or your leather face, it's not your Final Destination films or your Saw films. What made it so freaky was because it was just so different from other movies. You start to wonder during the film, ""What, this isn't real is it???"" As you might already know, the film is more of a documentary then it really is a movie. You don't know of the actors in the movie, nor the people and they seem so real. But also if you're planning to see this with your friends, don't. See it alone. Some movies are much more scarier seen alone, the Blair Witch Project it one of them. Not everyone is afraid of movies like these because they simply don't understand this type of horror. If you wanna be afraid of this movie be prepared to have scary things happen one step at a time. It's not all at once that is for sure. This movie will keep you watching. Again, see it alone. Or renting the movie will be a waste in my opinion."
"calledspanker","1","1","3","28 November 2006"," What a Joke this was!!!
","After 6 years I finally brought myself to watch the whole movie and now I know why I shouldn't have bothered. Its not the low budget that bothered me but the fact that it was so obvious that this whole thing is a set up. Its obvious that Heather set it all up and I reckon she did the other 2 in and is probably walking the streets somewhere still alive and well. Although I don't doubt the other 2 guys were genuine if people think that this is all real than people are still gullible these days. I mean really lets look at the facts. At the end of the movie they walk into a hut that is supposedly burnt to the ground????? I have no doubt it was not the original hut they made it out to be and probably one that Heather already knew about. And did anyone else notice that whenever they found something it was conveniently near Heather. Like the rocks for example, they just happened to be right outside Heather's tent. And of course the stick figures... yep Heather again. This left me to believe that either Heather did set up the whole thing or everything including the interviews were all a setup for the sake of a few dollars and a bit of tourism."
"karl_consiglio","10","1","3","5 November 2006"," Scary and Original
","This is to me a great piece of creative work. Very original, very scary with no music to guide you. Three naive American youths venturing into something they have no clue about in its very element. There is a character when they are still interviewing people about the Blair Witch who comes out holding the bible and seems to know a lot more than anyone else who they did not take into account enough, they just thought she was a weirdo. I like how with such a low budget you can have such wonderful results. The film gets more and more and more intense as we go along. They are really getting messed psychologically besides being lost and hungry. The most frightening part in this film if you ask me is that last shot in the house. It gives me the shivers just recalling it."
"mlraymond","3","1","3","22 October 2006"," Potentially scary film ends up annoying viewers, not frightening them
","I did not see the fake documentary on TV that was shown before the movie was exhibited in theaters, so I went on what I had read about it.It seemed to have some real potential, but there was a pitfall built in from the beginning: The reported determination of the producers not to show any monsters or maniacs; nothing that the three students couldn't have filmed themselves. This might have been an interesting concept, but it just does not work in the actual movie. I found it really annoying that not once in the entire film does anyone, either townspeople or students, say anything remotely serious or believable about the alleged Blair Witch. The closest it gets to that is when a man is being interviewed and he recounts the true story of the hermit who had murdered some children right at the start of World War Two. But even this seemingly promising thread goes nowhere, as it's never connected to the Blair Witch. Heather stands before a couple of locations, including a cemetery and Coffin Rock, and makes dramatic pronouncements about what happened at these places,without ever giving us a clue as to what she's referring to.The one eerie part that might have really worked up to a genuinely frightening conclusion was the disappearance of the one student, body parts being found, and terrible screams and then his voice calling to the other two for help. I toyed with the idea that a possible explanation is that he went crazy and ran off, hid out, and then murdered the other two. But we are never given any kind of real explanation for the ending. One can only assume that the remaining two students are about to be killed by someone or something, but we have no idea who or what it might be. The audience needs to be shown something, however small or insignificant it might seem. Val Lewton understood this with his RKO Studios horror pictures of the Forties. He and his crew used sounds and shadows and darkness to scare the audience by suggesting something evil was lurking nearby, or something terrible was about to happen.The Lewton pictures show just enough, without overdoing it. Best example: The Leopard Man, 1943. In a small town where an escaped leopard is prowling, a young girl has to go out alone in the dark of night to the store. She has to pass under a railroad bridge. As she starts forward fearfully into the blackness, two glowing eyes stare at her from high up and then disappear. The audience wonders if we actually saw something. A train suddenly hurtles overhead with a terrifying noise and flash of light. As we recover from this fright, there is a closeup of the roaring panther as it attacks the girl! She runs home screaming and begs to be let in, but her mother refuses to open the door. Terrible growls and screams are heard and then a pool of blood slowly puddles under the door. Now, THAT is scaring the audience with very little! There is more fright in five minutes of that film than all tedious 87 minutes of The Blair Witch Project. If only the producers had put one tenth of the imagination into the actual movie as the marketing campaign, they might have really given us a memorable horror film. As it is, The Blair Witch Project is basically nothing more than a clever idea, badly realized."
"snesgo","10","1","3","13 October 2006"," How scary the truth can be
","The Blair Witch Project is not a horror story, it is the edited footage discovered of the horrifying ordeal that three college students face. In 1994, they disappeared and the case was never solved, then, a year later, Heather Donahue's backpack of film is found in a place that hasn't been touched by human hands for more than a century, a place it couldn't logically be. They climb up a slope near the end that is at nearly a 45 degree angle, in a place where the hills were only that steep over a hundred years ago. It is not a story at all. It is a factual account, generally accepted, though, as a fictional film. Just read backlogged papers, or check out the Blair Witch Dossier as compiled by D.A. Stern."
"Phantasm01","10","1","3","9 August 2006"," Must be seen with your mind's eye
","To all of those folks out there that walked out of the theater wanting their money back because they didn't see a witch or blood or people being torn limb from limb, WAKE UP! In order for this movie to terrify you, you have to have an alert and productive mind. Remember Psycho? Did you actually see the lady in shower get stabbed? Did you see buckets of blood? Of course not but it scared you just the same.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project used the same tactics. Three people wander off to get film on a legend that they've heard. The town of Burketsville had an unusually high death rate of young children for a time. After interviwing some of the locals, the film crew decides to venture into the woods to find the shack that the so-called Blair Witch was using. The crew gets lost and has to spend the night in the woods where something appears to be following them. Trying to descibe this film any further than that just wouldn't be helpful to you at this time. It is a story that reveals itself in the visual, not just auditorially.<br/><br/>What could be scarier than being lost in the woods at night? The scariest things you can imagine are in your own mind. That's why kids are afraid of the dark. Their minds are young, fertile and active. They don't even know what they're afraid of, they just are. This film uses that same principle.<br/><br/>Our minds have become lazy from having everything being presented to it on a silver platter. No time to think, just keep feeding it images so it doesn't have to do any work on it's own! I don't think I've ever seen a more frightening movie and I've seen them all. I love horror and I'm always fascinated by the many different ways that Hollywood comes up with to scare us. Granted at this point, most horror these days is just is some madman running around slashing teenagers or weirdo cults worshipping Satan. No imagination. Get with it gang.<br/><br/>The scariest things are the things you can't see!"

","The beauty of The Blair Witch Project is it's simplicity. There are no special effects, no make up effects, and no real script. Just a simple idea and a box full of improvisations. They only use two hand-held cameras throughout the entire film, and natural lighting. If the light from the camera isn't on something, you can't see it. We never actually see the witch, but we feel a presence. Somebody had to mess with the tent right? Somebody had to put together the sticks! Was it the Witch? Was it a couple of locals messing with the film students? I don't know! But, because of the simple, yet very effective twist ending, I've got a pretty good idea. This movie may give you motion sickness, but it just adds to the simple reality of it all."

I am sad to say that for me, this movie failed to live up to its expectations in a big way. I have seen it twice now, and I got more scared watching ""Junior"" with Schwarzenegger than I did watching ""The Blair Witch Project"". The biggest issue I have with this film is one I have with many sub-par horror flicks; the characters act totally irrational and stupid, and as the movie went on, I started cheering for whatever was hunting the characters. I felt no sympathy for them, and frankly could not wait for them to be punished for their stupidity. Examples: A) One of the characters purposely throws away their map. B) When they realize something is hunting them, they still continue log around all their equipment, in stead of discarding everything except the bare essentials in order to be able to move faster. C) The characters are scared out of their mind and they come to a house in ruins with strange figures outside it. In stead of bypassing it, they f_ucking go in. (At this point I not only wanted the thing to kill them, I wanted Jack Bauer to jump in and torture them first!) D) The whole time they are being hunted they never put down the camera. I know that the point-of-view thing is the whole concept of the movie, but it is just so unrealistic that a person in fear of his life will continue to film, in stead of picking up something to defend himself with. All in all I give the movie 3/10 because of its originality and clever marketing."

The cameras that they used were used superbly and switching to a Black and White camera for night time usage was brilliant.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is anything but. <br/><br/>The film has a sort of faux-naif quality about it. It was shot on hand-held cameras in a deliberate attempt to mimic an amateur style of film-making, although the results are so poor that they would shame even the average home movie, let alone a project made by a group of student film makers, who would presumably have received some sort of training in basic film technique. Only a few minutes of the supposed ""footage"", in fact, consists of material which might conceivably have formed part of the projected documentary. Most of the rest consists of scenes of the three students wandering about after getting lost in the forest, endlessly quarrelling with and screaming at each other in a torrent of foul language. Why the supposed students would have wasted their film on these scenes is not explained. It appears, from a series of unexplained occurrences, that someone, or something, is pursuing the students, although it is never clear exactly who or what is involved. No explanation for their disappearance is ever given.<br/><br/>The film has sometimes been praised for reinventing the horror genre for the late nineties, but this strikes me as an impossible ambition. The genre seems to have become stuck in a cul-de-sac, able to inspire little beyond cynically self-mocking parodies along the lines of the ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movies"" series. ""The Blair Witch Project"" never succeeds in breaking out of this cul-de-sac for the reason that its approach is a quite uninteresting one; lengthy, badly-shot scenes of people running through the woods and shouting at one another do not make for entertaining viewing. I was never able to feel either sympathy for such an unsympathetic bunch or terror on their behalf. There was only one frightening thing about the film: that such a badly-made, badly-acted, over-hyped film could manage to generate such media attention and to achieve such success at the box office. 2/10"

However, I didn't find the whole body of the movie as scary as some people make it as, but there are definitely some very scary parts that are just very atmospheric but not gory or violent. For example, the discovery of the pile of rocks was very scary, the discovery of the wooden ""witch stick figures"" was also very scary as well. The scariest part for me however, took place in the abandoned house...enough said, this movie is scary...don't watch it alone and in the dark. <br/><br/>This movie contains lots of profanity, and very VERY little few violence, only one scene that is truly gory/violent.."

","Having grown up on that mountain less than a mile from Burkittsville, MD, The only impact this movie - and I use the term loosely - had on me was how I really should go invest in a video camera. Flick very poorly and cheaply done without benefit of any actual research on the history and folklore of the area, Strategy, excellent. A lot of bucks made for spending just enough in productions to peak curiosity. Kudos, wish I'da thought of it. And I may yet do a similar one, made just as cheaply, but based on the stories and lore about restless spirits left over from the atrocities that really happened, and happened there. Not in Seneca Creek or Patapsco State Parks, safely just outside of Baltimore where this was filmed. Blair witch, bull. That was just the rantings of one scared individual in an attempt to avoid being executed for assisting in the murder of kids 65 years ago, and the really sick one behind it was one of the kids. If you're really interested in actual events or the history beyond the twisted fairy tales, look it up for yourself. But if you're not from around there, the spirits don't know you and you shouldn't be there, hanging out at night, treading on grounds that have become sacred to them, that contain their remains. Grounds that you have no respect for. Stay in town where you belong. The truth runs much farther back and is not just a lot stranger than fiction - it's much more terrifying."

I know that sounds lame but it's true. The movie makes you think for yourself, especially the ending which is completely open to interpretation.

If any of those elements were different the movie wouldn't have been what it was supposed to be about. It would have ruined the entire production. The actors weren't actors. The shakey filming made the film seen more amateur. And you never saw the witch because how could you? The students filming the documentary had no idea what was after them. How could you know more than they knew? You watched the film through their eyes. There was no second or third party in this film.

"Tribaltwat-lover","2","1","3","16 May 2003"," I was so... bored.
","'The Blair Witch Project' was one of THE film phenomena of 1999. It managed to do something that few 'horror' films do - audiences were enraptured and critics applauded. Well done. The film was original in its approach and atmosphere was quickly projected. Unfortunately this seems to be all the film has going for it.<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Centering on three young people making a documentary about a local myth in order, it seems, to find out whether there is any truth in it, the film follows the protagonists into woods around which the 'Blair Witch' myth centres. They hear noises in the night, see some blobs of light and get lost in the woods. Soon, they begin to become agitated with one another sporadically, and tensions rise within the group. One of them disappears and leaves his teeth behind. The pair left behind worry for their friend and follow his voice to an empty house where they get killed. Boo-hoo.<br/><br/>My summary may be only skeletal, and biased by my distaste for the film, but it gives one an idea of how inherently awful the plot is. Of course, plot is not everything, as so many have proved before, but unfortunately the film also suffers from a terrible script. The characters, while not suffering from one-dimensionalism, fail to convince because they seem so utterly motiveless in everything they do or say. There is some improvisation, which utterly fails to convince due to the chronically opaque acting during the second half of the movie. Development seems totally absent. The closest thing is the repetitive structure of increasingly emotionally tense days followed by increasingly noise-filled nights. Unfortunately this is all that happens. The emotion merely increases and the noises merely get louder.<br/><br/>Much of the 'footage' at night is punctuated by long moments in which the viewer merely sees a blank screen and listens to some heavy breathing (and wonders why they were foolish enough to PAY for the privilege). When finally, the plot moves along somewhat, it is exceptionally dull. The characters supposedly begin to 'lose it' and become feral enough to begin running around screaming, jerking around their camcorder just a little bit more than necessary. They enter a house, scream some more and lose sight of each other before dying.<br/><br/>But, alas, I have explained why the bad constituents are so awful far enough, I hope. Now I should perhaps state why the good parts don't work. Firstly, the film's original approach. The pretense that the film is 'footage' left behind serves to allow the camera to be extremely subjective. One would surmise that this would draw the viewer in to the picture, but it in fact alienates the viewer due to the camera's own self-consciousness. Presumably this is because the actor's apparently filmed much of the footage themselves (or so I am told). Whether the directors wished to alienate the viewer intentionally I don't know, but it does not work with the hyper-personal nature of the film.<br/><br/>Secondly, the films evocation of atmosphere. This is the one thing that the film does very well. Very quickly the viewer's mind is filled with ideas of witchcraft, the supernatural etc. The power of the horror genre lies in its ability to take one's fears and twist them into something worse inside your head. This film doesn't do that. It merely continues those fears' natural proliferation in a boring manner.<br/><br/>I will not recommend another film, but rather suggest that you think about the supernatural, or demons, or whatever, and then go and sit in the living room late at night with the lights off. It will be a wholly more interesting experience.<br/><br/>2 out of 10"

Brilliant original scary and GOOD!"
"lwjoslin","9","1","3","24 July 2002"," Fear itself
","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror movie about fear itself.  Since fear is subjective, the movie is like a Rorschach ink-blot test: you'll either see something there or you won't.  My brother and I disagreed as to whether it was boring or terrifying.  We were both right: it bored him, and it terrified me.<br/><br/>In the late '50's, Robert Bloch, in an essay titled ""The Clown at Midnite"" [sic], generally lamenting the state of horror movies at the time, posed the rhetorical question, ""What is a horror movie?""  It is, he said, a movie whose content horrifies.  Obvious, perhaps; but nonetheless, he said, studios had forgotten how to make them, opting instead for monster movies, sci-fi movies, big-bug movies, and mad-doctor movies, full of shock and ""gore"" moments (moments only, in those days), freighted with ""comic relief,"" saddled with the obligatory romantic subplot, and replete with ""latex false faces that wouldn't frighten a two-year-old.""  He concluded that there simply was no such thing any more as a movie made just to scare the hell out of you.<br/><br/>Since then, there have been a few.  ""The Haunting"" (the 1963 original, not the execrable 1999 remake) was one; so was the (original) ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the (original) ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""  Three very different flicks, but all very frightening, and -- considering the red-meat subject matter of the last two -- quite restrained.  NOTLD and TCM were also low-budget indies, which added to their gritty credibility.<br/><br/>Into the pantheon of low-budget/no-budget horror now goes ""The Blair Witch Project,"" a product of the thriving film industry of Maryland (which gave us the oeuvre of John Waters).  Minimalism at its minimal-est, BWP (these low-budget creepers always have ""mouthful"" titles best reduced to initials) is presented as a pseudo-documentary.  The premise is that, in October 1994, three student filmmakers set out into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about a local legend, the malefic Blair Witch, a Colonial-era miscreant said to haunt the woods still.  (One is reminded of the Jersey Devil, the subject of a similar, slightly earlier, and even LOWER-budgeted movie, ""The Last Broadcast."")  The three kids were never seen again, but a year later, their footage was found.  And that is what we watch.<br/><br/>Heather, Josh and Mike (the names of the actors as well as the characters) set out on this weekend camping trip as a lark.  But the fun dries up when they promptly get lost, and as the days drag on, are cold, hungry, tired, panic-stricken, getting on each other's nerves -- and stalked by an unseen presence.  As in, say, ""Rear Window,"" we the viewers are trapped along with the protagonists; as in, say, NOTLD, they start turning on each other.  And they learn too late that you can be young, hip, smart, and middle-class, living in a world of computers and fast food, and still --  when you're lost in a patch of woods you wouldn't have thought big enough to get lost in, in a part of the country long settled and urbanized, and just a few miles from DC -- find yourself prey to primal fears, mostly of the dark.  This is, as I said, an essay about fear itself.  No masked madman with a chainsaw is after these kids, no plague of flesh-eating zombies, no ghost -- maybe not even a witch.  But SOMETHING is out there; the kids aren't just scaring themselves, as it becomes agonizingly clear.<br/><br/>Shot in color video and B&W 16mm film (the two cameras the kids lug with them), BWP is a technical oxymoron: credibly spontaneous (much of it was, in fact, ad-libbed), yet beautifully and effectively edited.  The one false note comes early on: one of the locals, an eccentric woman whom claims to have seen the witch, totes a huge Bible and wears a rosary (incorrectly) as a necklace.  She might as well wear a sign that says ""Religious Nutcase."" Pity she was rendered so stereotypically: in movies of this sort, with ill-advised questers heading into dangerous ground, there's usually a disreputable-looking eccentric warning them not to go.  So while this character belonged here and her eccentricity is a given, it's too bad that, in a flick of otherwise great verisimilitude, her phony props distract from her acceptable performance.<br/><br/>The image that will long linger in mind comes near the film's end: Heather, taping herself in such closeup that we see her only from the nose up, whispers a panicky, tearful farewell and apology to her parents and those of her crewmates.  ""I'm scared to close my eyes...  I'm scared to open them... We're gonna die out here...""  Brrr!  Fear itself."

","My pick for original film of the year goes to BWP.  It has been a long time since I have been so excited to see a film and boy did this one live up to my expectations.  In my review I would like to make several points about this film and the reactions of other people seeing the film.<br/><br/>1.)  If you liked the string of teen slashers we have been forced to endure lately or you liked the remake of the Haunting, then please, do the people who enjoy good films a favor and do not see the film.  I have seen the movie twice and have been through two very different experiences.  The first time I saw was at a local ""art"" theaters, that is to say one of the 27 theaters that got the film on the 15th.  This was a great experience.  It was quiet throughout the WHOLE film and the atmosphere in the theater was that of enjoyment.  The people there knew what they wanted and this film delivered. They basically felt as I did.  The second time I saw the film was at the local stadium theater after the wide release.  This was less than enjoyable. In front of me was a couple with a BABY! Behind me was a family of loud kids and and even louder parents.  They felt it their duty to inform people as to ALL the happenings on the screen and that the movie was boring.  At the end, one patron actually yelled out ""This movie f***ing sucks!""  This was not an enjoyable experience.  I was angry at the people.  This is why I urge you not to go if you are not ready for an intelligent, psychological thriller with virtually no special effects.<br/><br/>2.)  I urge everyone else to see this film.  If you want to be scared, see this film.  It reminds me of the first time I saw the Haunting(original). I was so scared because I had to imagine the ""monster"".  I was left to ponder what was going on.  That was so frightening.  I have not been as scared in my life as I was after seeing the BWP.  This film is such a relief from the usually ""here is your cgi monster now be scared darnit"" flicks.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying all intelligent movie goers will enjoy the movie, but I do believe they will be able to see it for what it is, original.  A movie with NO script, NO name actors, and all real human experience.  That what this film captures.  The human experience, and films that do it as successfully as this film are true masterpieces and deserve a second look."

","Quick summary - lots of laughs while waiting for something to happen. <br/><br/>
Longer view - The acting is pretty good, I'll give it that.  The character ""Heather"" has a VERY annoying interview style, but aside from that the three main actors give convincing performances.  The marketing is spectacular. The soundtrack needs some work (hee hee).<br/><br/>The problem being there is NO PAYOFF, real or implied (yes, I am capable of appreciating subtlety).  In the mercifully short 82 minute running time, I was reasonably ""scared"" for about 5 minutes.  The rest of the time I was either laughing at the dialogue (this should go in the comedy section when it makes it to video) or imagining how this film was going to freak me out (not even close, I'm afraid).<br/><br/>As the credits rolled I told the friend I was with ""WE could have done this. And made something that was GOOD.""  I will not let this be an empty statement.  I'm finally going to write a screenplay, get funding, and shoot a movie.  So I thank all the ""Blair Witch"" crew for inspiring me to ""show 'em how it's done.""<br/><br/>All in all, I paid $7.25 and wasted about an hour and a half of my time. Much less time and money than I invested on my last girlfriend (now if you want to hear a SCARY story...)"

","This is the best horror/thriller movie I've ever seen.  Despite the absence of ax wheeling maniacs and masked blood thirsty killers, this film will scare the wits out of you.  Blair Witch uses a much better tactic for fear, the viewer's imagination.  You never seen the witch but it still gets you.

For instance, take the lead actress. Her breasts are way too small! And she doesn't show them off! How can they expect to sell this film to a mass audience? And the situations are completely outlandish. These people are being stalked by a killer, and they're not cracking wise and having sex with wild abandon, like the eerily-realistic teens in ""Scream""?<br/><br/>I recommend that you, the great unwashed masses, not see this film, and instead spend your money on some quality filmmaking like the new Adam Sandler movie.<br/><br/>I have spoken."
"dns","1","1","3","3 August 1999"," What is all the fuss about???? Boring!!!!
","After reading endless reviews praising this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it.  It has been a long time since I saw a really scary movie.  Unfortunately, after seeing this film I am still wanting to see a really scary movie. <br/><br/>The acting is bad, the footage shaky home video or bad b&w 35 mm.  The plot is pretty much non-existent.  No characters really develop, and the thing just generally flounders around for 90 minutes before drawing to a close. <br/><br/>
This films biggest problem is the *tremendous* amount of hype about it. None of it is deserved.  This just simply isn't a scary movie unless you are 8 years old and haven't progressed beyond the stage where any noise in the dark scares you.  If you find twigs hanging from a tree and piles of rocks scary, then this movie is for you.  Otherwise, you will suffer thru 85 minutes of it to get to final 3 minutes, which are almost bearable but still not that scary.  <br/><br/>
By the way, I was so p**sed off by this movie that while riding the elevator up to my apartment, I commented to the couple riding up with me [complete strangers] that 'If you were thinking of seeing Blair Witch Project, save your money'   Imagine my surprise when I found out that they were at the same neighbourhood theatre as I was and agreed with me 100%.  The woman of the couple commented that it was the worst film she'd ever seen.  The male of the couple commented that it was a good thing we went to see it on Tuesday, when movies are only $5.  ""Imagine how disappointed you'd been if it cost you $10""<br/><br/>
Maybe I am just missing something here.  If you think I'm out to lunch on this one, then let me know.  If you thought this was great, why??  And if you found it scary, again, Why??   <br/><br/>

","Over-hyped is the only word that describes this movie experience. The film introduces you to three college film students who the viewer never feels any remote attachment to.  The lead female role is so annoying that the audience laughed as she shrieked in terror.  The film tries too hard to establish the authenticity of the footage, meaning you get a lot of out of focus close-ups of the grass or the never popular blank screen.

As cheesy as The Haunting was,  it made me jump a little.  Realistic ?  Well,  maybe the dialog,  with every other word F--- or Bull----.

It was like sitting through someone's home movies of a backyard sleepover.  I'm sorry but unscripted, improvisational dialog does not work with this story.

"rookie-8","10","1","3","2 August 1999"," Needed the Lights on
","I grew up with scary movies. For some reason my parents, and my grandparents for that matter, thought it perfectly exceptable to show a young boy (I couldn't have been any older than 8 or 9 when I saw my first ""Friday the 13TH"" film) countless horror flicks that they were so engrossed in. By the time I saw ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" nothing was really all that scary. Yet, I have always found that the movies which leave the most fear behind are the ones with the least amount of gore and, more often than not, the least amount ""startle"" shots (Jason jumping out of the woods). The ""Exorcist"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, along with ""Alien"" and the ""Shining"" because of the sense of doom that each evoked in me. They were all terror driven movies, where the tension built and built without  relief until the final, classic scenes. It wasn't about  scaring someone for a moment, making them jump in there seat, but about truning a persons stomach inside out for more than an hour. Those movies caused people to squirm in their seat, to let out a soulful groan when a classic ""horror movie mistake"" was made, and to turn their face when the end was near because it was just to unsettling to see. That is why to me movies like the ones before mentioned, especially ""Exorcist"", are not merely horror classics but simply movie classics.<br/><br/>This film was billed as the ""best horror film since the Exorcist"" and, as you might have guessed that line sparked my interest. After reading several very positive reviews billing ""The Blair Witch Project"" as the scariest movie ever, and reading several posts from internet users concuring, my interest was further heightened. But then the phrases like ""overhyped"" began to be shot around and word that many user comments on well known, and trusted movie sites were planted by the studio or friends of the actors began to be spread, making me doubt the effect of this movie. I usually end up hating overhyped movies (Godzilla being the king of this genre) and am not easily scared to begin with, thanks to my families deliquent childhood pratices (sorry mom:). When time came to finally see this movie I entered it with very mixed emotions, most leaning towards the negative side of the spectrum. I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie is not only horrifying while watching it on the big screen, it is horrifying while driving home, walking to your home, looking out your window, or trying to go to sleep. It reaches you in so many different ways. I have read many people inferring to the ""unknown"" being the most frieghtening aspect of this film, and while I agree it is most unsettling, it is only a part of what makes this film work. The realism of the camera, which is shaky but does not draw away from what you are seeing, and the realism of the actors, who should all be nominated for Oscars, draw you into the woods. The instinctual fear of being lost in a foreign place without hope of being rescued quickly, the fear of unknown sounds and unknown forces at work all around you, the unsettling sight of people slowely losing their minds and their hope for survival, the nerve racking sound of people screaming and crying in absolute terror, and the fear of the dark all make this the most unsettling movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This is a squirm in your seat, look away from the screen, and tell me when it is over movie. The entire film held for me the intensity of the moment Tom Skerrits character went to go look for the alien in the vents, or when the little boy in ""The Shining"" kept reciting RedRum over and over, or when Chrissy Watkins is attacked by Jaws in the very opening scene. Many people felt the same way, as most did not leave their seat for a few minutes after the film had completed, and some clapped while others just let out a sigh of relief. My two friends, two of the more skeptical friends I have who are not easily impressed, had good reviews after the movie was over, but changed them to great reviews the day after as neither one could get to sleep that night. I myself, mister Jason is funny and Freddy is a comedian, had to sleep with a light on and closed blinds and found myself very happy to have my girlfriend sleeping over the next night for not the normal reasons:) Don't miss this movie. Don't wait for it to come on video. Don't wait for the spoilers to come out. Go see it now and get scared. I rate it a 9 1/2 out of 10, only because I thought the night scenes could have been longer."

"silk-12","1","1","3","1 August 1999"," A major disappointment
","[Editor's note: this comment contains minor SPOILERs]<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project has been heralded as the movie that was supposed to revive the horror genre to a much greater extent than the original 'Scream'. It was supposed to be a genuinely frightening film with little or no comic relief, no trick endings, and no disfigured killers who get knocked off at the end by the one remaining camp counselor who you could guess at the beginning of the movie.  I was supposed to be afraid to drive home after seeing it and have nightmares for weeks.  The hype on this flick was becoming unbearable the days before its release nationwide.  I was so excited to see a scary horror movie that would really scare me.  Most horror movies these days either turn into comedies with endless jokes and no serious edge or they turn into gory bloodbaths that nobody cares about. This movie was gonna be different.  So as soon as Blair Witch came out nationwide, I ran out to the theater, forked over the money for the ticket, sat back and waited to be scared. And I waited and waited and waited.  87 minutes later, the credits were rolling, the lights came on, and the only thing that scared me was that I paid good money to see that stupid so-called horror movie.  Nothing during the movie scared me or my girlfriend (who scares quite easily I might add).  The characters spend most of the time cursing at each other during the day and running around in the dark at night.  The things that are scaring them are barely audible and since they are shooting the scenes, you can't see much at all.  Heather never shuts up, never stops filming, and never knows where she is.  The two guys aren't much help.  An hour into it, I thought maybe the night scenes would still be terrifying once we get there.  Well, they weren't.  Other reviews claimed that the tent scene is soon to be famous.  Why?  It's not scary.  Neither is the rest of the film.  Okay, now it's close to the end.  Something's gotta go down now.  Five minutes later, the footage ends in a frantic, climax that MAKES NO SENSE.  If someone can explain it to me, please do.  I really would like to know what happened to them.  I saw nothing in the whole movie that could lead me to believe anything related to witchcraft was going on. There's no witch, no thrills, no chill.  The only thing I will remember from this dreadful attempt is the confusing, what-the-heck-was-that ending that I may never understand.  If you want to see a scary movie, rent the original 'Candyman' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street', turn off all the lights, turn up the surround sound, and be prepared for the nightmares later.  A truly demented and horrifying alternative to this junk would be 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.  Not this.  I'm sure I'd be scared to be out in the woods at night, lost, and weird stuff happening around me.  But it's not scary to watch in the theater.  This was perhaps the biggest disappointment I've ever felt after seeing a movie.  I gave it a 3 for the fact that I felt bad for the three people in it.  One Point per Actor/Actress.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  I have to be pretty fired up to submit a long review so you know this one really ticked me off."

","I faltered...I succumbed.  I went against everything about which Flavor Flav and Chuck D. so ardently tried to warn me: I believed the hype. <br/><br/>I called the theatre near me ahead of time...sold out. I went to a theatre in a less culturally aware area of town, thinking perhaps no one would have heard of this film...sold out. I waited in line hours earlier to buy tickets for the LATE late show, 11:45 PM. Finally, I held in my sweaty palm, a ticket to The Blair Witch Project. <br/><br/>I had visited the film's website. I read up a bit on the background. I heard the frightful reviews, and boy, I was ready to have the skin terrified from my very bones. I said READY...prepared...waiting...............still waiting. <br/><br/>Oh dear...over ten minutes of COMMERCIALS? Not trailers, mind you--they were still to come--but commercials; ADS. Appalling. This is why I stopped watching television. As I sat in the crowded theatre, nervously checking my watch, I noticed that it was nearly midnight. The fellow of no more than 17 seated next to me, leaned over and muttered, ""Is this your first time?"" I indicated that it was, and then he provided me with the unsolicited fact that he had seen it just the night before, and was so mesmerized, he'd returned this evening for a second viewing. THIS was why I didn't like people.<br/><br/>The lights went down...AT LAST...and I kept waiting.<br/><br/>""Do we have any weed?"" Heather Donahue asks coyly as the other two stooges guzzle beer and liquor in a cheap motel. A silent alarm sounded in my clearly distant Area 39. Surely, I told myself, SURELY this is just a flimsy effort to get the audience in synch with these three kids; make us feel for them. It will get better...won't it? MUSTN'T IT!??<br/><br/>As I was about to catch a catnap, hoping to perhaps wring SOMETHING substantial out of this evening, I realized that there were only TWO idiots now. Whatever happened to the third? Hmmmm. OK--capacity of attention span: MET AND SURPASSED. Next...?<br/><br/>Mucus...a lot of it. Heather, the pontificating, ever-eloquent a la ""Mary Brown...I thought she was fu--in' insane"" has the camera pointed at herself once again and is crying--not to mention SNOTTING--up a storm. Shouldn't I be feeling something by now...other than the need to use the restroom? Hmmm.<br/><br/>
Artisan Entertainment, after a masterpiece like 1998's Pi, why have you failed me? The only difference between the supposed emotion of Heather in her last hours, and say, Deborah Winger as the terminally ill Emma Horton in Terms of Endearment, is...I actually cared about Emma enough that I wanted her to LIVE...and Terms of Enderment was fiction! Enough said?<br/><br/>I chuckled to myself as the THUD was audible and Heather's camera dropped to the ground. Surely this loss of balance was the result of a sharp blow to the head from some disgruntled financier, or an Artisan executive with the horse sense to end production of this embarrassment in time to save face.<br/><br/>
If I had been in that house in Maryland five years ago, I might have done the deed MYSELF, just on general principle...just to make her STOP TALKING.<br/><br/>
My mother always told me not to follow the herd, because they were likely to end up in the slaughterhouse. I should have listened.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled, I thought less of the ""great film"" on which I had just wasted nearly ten dollars, and more of an actually pressing issue,<br/><br/>

","The pre-release publicity campaign for Blair Witch was truly awesome in its success at building anticipation, from the teen-target word of mouth stage right through the SciFi Channel hourlong trailer that set the movie up very effectively for its limited release in major US cities.  It's been many a full moon since this filmlover has seen an audience so charged up that they literally were running into the theatre to grab a good seat. We were going to see something new, something different. Above all, we were going to experience a film which was ""Scary as Hell!""<br/><br/>Instead, we got faux cinema verite with just a hint of Tobe Hooper.  Instead of shock we got a crock.  The cinematography, let's face it, was just plain poor.  The vaunted ""performances"" of the three leads were adequate acting-class improv.  The ending simply did nothing with the basic premise except to close it within the acceptable minimum running time.  As a fear-inducing entertainment, Blair Witch is dead on arrival.  When it opens wide this weekend, many an exhibitor will be deluged with demands for return of the ticket price.  Those reviewers and fans who suffer from the Emporer's New Clothes Complex (I believe this will be great, therefore it is!) are in for a mighty repudiation from the American filmgoing public, and Artisan, which artfully managed the hype-machine on this little movie, will be forced to pull the plug on any notion of mass-market success with this TBWP. <br/><br/>This said, Blair Witch does work really well on one level.  As a metaphor for the ignorance and ineptitude of the American media covering any story of real importance, the film is, in fact, a powerful indictment. I do suspect this was the real intent of the filmakers, so blatant is this theme as the movie unreels.  But as a fearsome chiller-thriller of the psychological variety? Please.  <br/><br/>For real films of this type, I refer the interested reader to Polanski's The Tenant, to Cronenberg's Videodrome, to M, Peeping Tom, or The (original) Haunting.  Blair Witch is worth seeing, but for none of the reasons put forth by its publicity campaign.  Filmgoers not conditioned to believe everything they hear will feel ripped off by Artisan, the Sundance crowd, and the filmakers themselves.<br/><br/>To these, I have one last word:<br/><br/>Booo!"

The first hour is mostly slow but funny, as you see how the three get on each others nerves.  Quickly the scene changes and everything becomes very serious, you find these kids are hunted, and the fact that you don't hear a narrator or ever see the camera pull away to show you the whole story is very disturbing.  At no point in this story do you see limbs being cut off, or monsters in the dark, with beady eyes.  This is a true thriller, you start being really scared about 1 hour into the movie, and the terror doesn't leave you until the next morning.

Why she wanted to claim the unimaginative, expletive charged, venomous kids who made this film, though, shall forever be a mystery.<br/><br/>With all the antagonism between the members of this film's cast/ victims, a reasonable guess as to what happened to them, is that they murdered each other!

The entire movie is seen from the points of view of two video cameras the characters brought with them, so right off the bat there's not much to be said for direction or cinematography.  The story is boring.  A bunch of students going off into the woods in search of proof of witch stories in a local town sounds like a good plot at first, but it doesn't go anywhere.  Literally.

"Asteri-Atypical","1","1","3","5 November 2001"," Freshman Film Making 101 (and still only a C+ in that class)
","This is one of the scariest movies I've seen.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>It's scary that so many people thought this movie was everything from ""wonderful"" to ""brilliant"".<br/><br/>This is probably the most overrated movie I've ever beheld.  It's somewhat decent for an amateur film festival film done by teenagers.  However there is little ""brilliant"" or even ""original"" about it.  Why it seemed so ground breaking was merely the fact an average student film was put on the big screen.<br/><br/>While I enjoy the concept of a horror story being told through the eyes of students, seeing the horror merely on the faces of the actors instead of special effects, shot with hand-cams and in ""raw documentary footage"" format, it was NOT executed well.<br/><br/>It is worth noting such a concept is NOT unique to student film festivals. It's only a departure from the ""typical"" Hollywood fare.  It seems some promoter decided to take such a typical student film and promote it in the general cinema market, making it sound like it was something new and innovative.  Sadly, the public bought it.<br/><br/>For a student film, this would have been more effective were it a lot shorter.  It dragged.  It would have been a cute short but the idea of making it a feature film is a poor one.  <br/><br/>The characters were too sophomoric, pedestrian, foolish and inconsistent to be enjoyed.  They acted foolish and dysfunctional (but not in an interesting way).  One could not relate to what appeared to be them causing their own hysteria from childish bickering and overreaction.  The dialogue was too pedestrian to be enjoyed.  ""Dude, that's like... so not cool"" was typical of the level of dialogue.  Who wants to watch undereducated ""Bill & Ted"" types come unglued?  The whole film would have been much more enjoyable had the characters been more interesting.  If you're going to build a film around the emotions of the characters, please don't make the characters Bill, Ted and Barbie.<br/><br/>There was not sufficient fodder for the imagination to evoke scary images. Make the fear either more mysterious or give us more imaginative scenarios. There was enough material to be interesting for perhaps 10 minutes.  After that you need something more than a couple piles of rocks and some twigs.<br/><br/>The thing this film had going for it is that it illustrates the rut into which Hollywood has fallen in recent years.  You don't need hundreds of millions to weave a basic tale.  Stories can be told without the effects, sets, big names and music.  Students have to resort to telling tales with what they have instead of falling back on the ""typical"" Hollywood style. The slightest departure from the norm is considered ""innovative"".  Hollywood should learn something here.  It also illustrates the point Hollywood doesn't have very intelligent stories, either, as Blair Witch, as shallow as it was, was able to compete.<br/><br/>In summary, if you're familiar with student or amateur film festival works, Blair Witch will give you nothing new.  If you have never seen anything outside of Hollywood, it's good to see something different.  Just don't make the mistake of thinking it's ""good"", however, just because it's ""not typical Hollywood"".  All in all, it's a pretty typical example of ""Freshman Film Making 101"" (but I don't think we have the next Steven Spielberg in the class this semester)"

The actors have watched too many Tarantino films and think good dialogue means a lot of swearing, especially the F-word. How do we show we're scared? We say ""oh F*** I'm so F***ing scared"". When I first heard about this movie and got to thinking about 3 students lost in the woods, not knowing what was going on, it gave me the creeps, I could imagine it. Walking home late one night through the woods I actually got pretty spooked. Then I saw the movie and thought, what a bunch of idiots. If I wanted to put my brain on hold then I could believe the kids were actually scared and lost and confused and possibly something evil in the woods was driving them loopy. Instead, thanks to very bad acting and unintelligent dialogue, I began thinking it might not be such a bad thing that they disappeared.<br/><br/>People who saw the Sci Fi mockumentary were lucky in that it enhances the story line.

","Several months ago, I critiqued on ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", one of the early films directed by Peter Weir. At that time, though I had not seen it, I had the feeling that that ""The Blair Witch Project"" perhaps was somewhat of an imitation of that movie. After just watching Blair Witch Project, I wish to apologize to director Weir for even trying to make a comparison. The only commonality was the permanent disappearance of the actors in both films. The truly splendid ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" was a small sensuous masterpiece with scenery and musical score that brought chills of emotion. ""Blair Witch"" was a non-masterpiece of hype. Tell everyone how frightening it is, so they will have to feel frightened. Tell everyone it is as scary as ""The Exorcist"" and they will feel guilty if they are not as scared. Tell everyone that this movie was made in only eight days, so they will think--""How incredible"" Enough said on that subject. As for hand held cameras, the producers and directors need to take a lesson from some of the Danish film producers who produced ""Mifune"" and are dedicated to the use of hand held cameras with a flair and verve that this film could never have. The suspense was so great that, my husband, fell asleep and our ten year old grand daughter said-- ""What a bore""."

","I caught this movie at a special sold out preview screening in Minneapolis and I can honestly say I've never been as scared as I was in that theater. This movie terrified me and everyone else present.  There were no cries of ""Don't go in there!"" or ""He's right behind you!"" from the audience.  Blair Witch is the only honestly touch-your-soul frightening movie I've ever seen. No one moved through the entire last half of the movie.  No one spoke, no one even breathed.  All hung in rapt concentration on the incredibly eerie images on the screen of three kids, scared, hungry, lost, and hunted.  I am still being haunted by several moments in the film, frozen in my memory by sheer terror.  Hours after the film, a friend and I tried to walk down a path through some woods-and failed.  We turned back a mere 5 minutes into the walk from fear of the very trees surrounding us.  To every indication this does not appear to be 'just a movie' and so it isn't.  This film is real enough to haunt anyone that sees it.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to camp again and I say that seriously.  Don't read anything else about this movie.  Don't find out the background or even bother to see the previews. Just see it, then try to go for a walk in the woods at night.  You won't be able to do it either."

","I saw this movie with my brother, I showed him all the reviews I could find so that he thought this movie was worth $9 student admission. How wrong I was! If there's a ""Most Wasted Popcorn Award "", I would nominate The Blair Witch Project. After I walked out of the theater, we could barely walk. All the movements of the camera in the film made me sick, not to mention how horribly BAD the movie itself is. Come on, all those stories in the horror movies doesn't really exist! They are just like that-movie. And when you mix it with total reality, it doesn't work. If they shot a few more glimpses of the witch, it might be better. All the made -up things in it is just ridiculous. This IS original, but it's not scary at all (or at least, not a bit scarier than any other horror movies). This creativity should be put somewhere else, not on the big screen. If you want good horror, don't waste your time and money on this movie .

"eibon04","1","1","3","10 March 2000"," Unmemorable Movie
","The makers of The Blair Witch Project have done a good job at pulling the wool over people's eyes making them think that this is actually good.  Just because a film was made for little money does not make it a great movie(it's not how much you spend but how much you put into a film).  This movie is inconclusive when judging the directors abilities as one horror movie hit does not make a great director.  I believe that the two directors have to do more films before passing judgement on how good they how.  I think it is silly to compare them with the likes of Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Tod Browning, and other great directors of horror films as The Blair Witch Project might be the only decent movie that they will ever make.<br/><br/>One problem I have with the movie is there is nothing to remember.  There are no scenes or lines that stand out and make people remember it for.  The movie was like a one and a half hour whale watch trip(the experience was similar to attending a whale watch as a person starts to feel sick).  What I hate about this movie was that it seemed that the directors did not any artistic vision and this is the main problem of the film as I feel that nothing emotionlly was put into it(a bad thing is when two people direct as they have different styles while one director would use a style that the crew can get familar with).  BWP is not a scary movie and anyone who says so is not a real horror movie fan who've seen real horror films but mostly Johnny come latelys.  The success of this film worldwide proves that the human being are becoming more dumber and idiotic and that no one has any taste for great art anymore(we have mostly tase for art of mediocrity). The art of greatness is dead, but the art of mediocrity is alive."
"ACB-6","1","1","3","11 February 2000"," Can you say boring?
","Alright, so this movie did wonders for the independent film industry; it showed a low-budget film could do just as well as a multi-million dollar film, but it does not mean the movie was good. I viewed this movie based on the great reviews it was getting, but I left the theater wishing I had waited for someone to rent the video so I could watch it.  Maybe it is because I live in a heavy wooded area, but I found nothing bone-chilling about the movie.  It got a little boring watching people scream at each other for an hour.  The ending was kind of neat, but the story until this point left me checking my watch to see how much longer until the end. People raved about the camera work in the film.  I appreciate artistic film work, but an hour and a half of shaky camera work, and many shots of pitch darkness is not a movie, it is a bad home video.  Yes this camera style functioned well in scenes, but it became an annoyance several times. Maybe I am old fashioned, but The Blair Witch Project will not be my favorite terror movie.  As far as I am concerned Hitchcock will always be the master of terror and suspense (and masterful camera work)."
"jbost-2","10","1","3","4 February 2000"," A Masterpiece of Terror!
","After reading some of the bad reviews I have seen here, I get the distinct feeling that the modern horror genre thrives on special effects, and people have come to expect that.  Well, the Blair Witch Project proves that you can have horror WITHOUT computerized special effects...REALLY GOOD HORROR.  The best horror is that which reflects the true darkness each of us harbors deep down in the pits of our souls.  It is this darkness that really comes out to play in the movie.  Sure, the plot sounds like a Grimm Brothers fairy tale (imagine Hansel and Gretel lost in the woods, til they find the witches house).  But the story is nowhere near two-dimensional.  Instead, you watch as the characters slowly pass from annoyance, anger, and exhaustion to dread, paranoia, and yes, fear.  That is the real theme of the movie.  The plot is so much window dressing.  Pay attention to the very beginning of the movie, as it proves pivotal in understanding the bizarre (and TERRIFYING) ending.  The plot is interesting, and you wonder if the legends really are true, but the most effective part of the movie is the level of self-identification with the characters.  A warning though: you may sit and laugh during the whole movie, but when the full effect of the ending hits you, I promise you too will be scared of the woods.  I did not watch this in the theater myself, but rented it on video.  Watching it with the lights off was bad enough, but lying in bed that night watching the shadows on the wall was worse.  The old maxim is false: what you can't see CAN hurt you!  This is DEFINITELY worth the money!  BUY THE VIDEO!"

It's about coming home from the movie and looking over your shoulder because you're afraid of what you can't see.

","...not the movie, the people COMMENTING on it. I've posted once before, but scrolling down, I see that there are STILL so many suckers who bought INTO this piece of garbage, I felt it necessary to reiterate a few key points, mainly:<br/><br/>-""The Blair Witch Project"" is, hands down, one of THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE. And yeah, I AM taking movies like ""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""Nail Gun Massacre"", and ""Robot Holocaust"" into consideration. When you have NO script (I still can't believe that), amateurish cinematography that prevents you from actually SEEING anything (""use your imagination"", the flick's fans bray, missing the point that when EVERYTHING is left to the imagination there's no point in SEEING the movie at all), ""actors"" whose best ad-libbing comes in the form of repetitive and offensive cursing, and a classic ""Ebert Situation"" - that the whole movie could have been over in fifteen minutes had the characters not been complete IDIOTS - this is to be expected.<br/><br/>-That BWP made the kind of money it did is a damning indictment of the American filmgoer, and a tribute to the effectiveness of fake word-of-mouth. So many people believed this was real, or terrified themselves by putting themselves ""in the situation"". Three words: Follow the river. There; the whole movie is unnecessary. But the characters are so stupid that this sure-fire solution never occurs to them... and these are COLLEGE students? It's never a good sign when you WANT the heroes to die.<br/><br/>-Most of the hype for this movie was fake, generated in spades via faux-amateurish Web sites and supposed ""fan"" reviews actually generated by the ""filmmakers"" and their friends. The glowing reviews? Fake (In fact, I'm willing to bet that half of the mini-reviews HERE are fakes - at least, the initial reviews; you'll notice that they soon become overwhelmingly negative, and that the people defending it become much fewer and farther between). While this practice is, of course, nothing new, I do not believe it has EVER worked as well as it has with ""Blair Witch Project"" - the Artisan spin machine must have gone into overdrive when the folks there saw what a hideously bad movie they had on their hands. They are to be commended for successfully deceiving so many people.<br/><br/>To sum up: This entire movie is a sham, made by untalented hacks and deceptively promoted. If you thought this was a ""groundbreaking"" horror movie, then you obviously do not watch horror movies, nor are you aware of the elements that make a successful one (the reviewers who glowingly compare it to movies like ""Scream"" are proof of that). If you identified with the characters - if you liked the movie at all - then you're an idiot."

I got a headache for the way it was filmed and was tired of hearing Heather Donahue's constant screaming.

"GradeZ","10","1","3","30 April 1999"," Innovative yet retro-horror film is the scariest film in years
","There was something about those horror films of the seventies and early eighties set in the clandestine corridors of backwoods country.  Maybe it was the eerie rustling of the wind or the lifeless autumn leaves that provided the feeling of death and isolation.  This is the setting of The Blair Witch Project - a film that is based on the premise that it is the discovered footage shot by a team of amateur film makers investigating a piece of Maryland folklore. The team entered the woods and never came out.<br/><br/>The most refreshing aspect of this horror masterpiece is that it understands the strength of subtlety.  This film more than any other in recent memory, exploits the power of suggestion and invokes the hidden fears that could only crawl from the darkest corners of our imagination.  It seems that the horror genre has been inundated with movies driven by special effects of late.  These films have forgotten that horror movies by nature are supposed to be, above all else, scary.  They should make our hearts jump and our skin crawl.  The Blair Witch Project does this.  It scares with its simplicity - using children's voices in the night, wooden figures hanging from twisted tree branches, and prolonged periods of darkness.<br/><br/>Among truly scary films of the recent past (Black Christmas and the Exorcist are two), The Blair Witch Project is at the top.  Hopefully this film will remind horror filmmakers that the unknown is, more often than not, more terrifying than anything that can be captured by a camera."

(Although I doubt it.) If you plan on watching this alone, with the lights out, you might get REALLY scared. (I know I did.)

The student/producer and her two-man, also-college-age crew, start off into the dense, dark Maryland woods almost daring the Blair Witch to show herself. When it seems their wish is just about to come true, the one-time jovial banter, cockiness, and ""machismo,"" soon turns into utter desperation. It is scary. It is eerie. And, it is troubling.

Don't believe the hype, you will be duped into parting with hard-earned cash for an hour and a quarter of total rubbish.  If you're expecting to be scared, you will be sorely disappointed.  This is not supposed to be a conventional horror film, but even giving it miles of leeway it fails miserably.  The only enjoyable thing is the comedy factor of watching the two guys flip out at the girl for being an annoying whiner. The first hour is pure comedy in a kind of docu-drama version of 'Slacker' (a great film by the way).  The girl is the annoying, enthusiastic and naive filmaker, Michael is a serious, straight kind of guy and Josh is somewhere inbetween, leaning more towards a kind of surfer-dude than anything else. The interaction between the three is enjoyable, especially when things start to go wrong, but you find yourself wishing they'd either get on with the horror or just give it a miss entirely, as the 'horror' sections in the first hour come simply as annoying interruptions of the comedy.  The last 15 minutes do create some kind of tension and atmosphere, but even that is not used very effectively.  In the docu-film TV series 'Michael Palin's 80 Days...', at least we had the scare of Michael occasionally missing a train and being stuck in a train station, but this docu-horror doesn't even scare that much."

They're trapped in the woods for several days, hungry, tired, scared to death....but all they can do is complain and cry about it!  I mean come on, give us a break!  And this whole time that someone's ""there"" scaring them, nothing happened to make me jump out of my seat!  I didn't even get gored out, considering no one even got chopped to bits!

Then morbid.  Then pointless. And to top it off, the movie has no conclusion.  Even Alien had a point.  Even The Texas Chainsaw Massacre had a satisfying conclusion.  Same with Halloween.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing but exploitation--at or below the level of Friday the 13th.  There is no sense of good versus evil, no sense of meaning.

","I'm sorry, but I have to say that this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  I will say that I may have been biased by the hype, but this movie was not scary at all.  I was expecting to see a movie that actually made me jump or get worked up.  There was only one time that this movie could have made me jump, when they were in the tent and the sides were being pounded on, but by then I was just so annoyed by the annoying personalities, I just wanted the movie to end.  I will say that I am sorry that I feel this way, I really wanted to like and be scared by this movie, but it just wasn't the case.  I could see that the three students were scared, at least by their level of swearing, they seemed to be, but their fright was not properly passed on to me.  What would I have done different? First off, make some of the shots a little clearer, when Heather was opening the stick packet and found the bloody mess, I couldn't make out what it was. I understand that it was part of Josh, but WHAT WAS IT?  It just added to my annoyance.  Add the outside perspective, not just one of the characters shooting.  After the 2nd or 3rd night of horror, they could have realistically set up a camera to record the campsite so we could see something happening.<br/><br/>Like I said, I've been waiting for a movie to really scare the s**t out of me and hoped this would do it, but I was severely disappointed.  Maybe the next one to come along will.<br/><br/>

","This had to be the most boring horror movie I have ever seen. There was no suspense, all the horror parts lasted only seconds, while having them wander through the woods during the day took up the majority of the screen time. A lot of the reviews state there is a plot spoiler in the text, but how can you spoil a movie where nothing happens.  As far as believing it is a true documentary, the last part shows two of them running around, who is filming. I just wonder what happened to the people that found the so called documentary, did they die of boredom?  I'm not sure, but I'm sure we will have to find out in a sequel."

","I remember when the original Halloween was released, a horror movie that actually made my heart beat faster. Most horror movies made in the last 20 years spend to much time and money trying to make blood and guts look ""real"". Grossing you out more than scaring you. Blair Witch gave me the same feeling as Hitchcock's ""Psycho"",less the the visual perfection from Hitchcock.

I must salute the creators for the wonderful hype and mystery that really was a work of art !<br/><br/>To say the characters were 2 dimensional would be to reward them with too much depth. Three US college kids were always going to find it hard to connect with a UK audience but these three managed to make it damn near impossible!<br/><br/>The ONLY time of tension for me was the un-steady-cam run from the tent into the dark, but 5 minutes does not make a suspenseful movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was very disappointed with the film in general and the end in particular.

By the virtue of the filming technique it creates an air of believability that you can't shake throughout. I have never been so scared in a theater before. The cast is awesome and the story is believable. Move over Stephen King.<br/><br/>The entire movie sustains this feeling that you are with the campers in the movie, and you are as scared as they are. When they lose hope and cry you lose hope and cry. I honestly believed this movie the entire way through, with the possible exception of the end shot.<br/><br/>Rolling Stone called it what it is: ""Scary as Hell"""

","The only thing I can truly be thankful for is, perhaps, the horror genre will finally move away from the hack & slash gore which has flooded the silver screen for the past 30 years with pale imitators of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"". As for ""The Blair Witch Project"" itself, the film is two-dimensional in both character and plot.  I couldn't help but to keep looking at my watch everytime a series of whiny exchanges between the three main characters kept repeating ad nauseam. Unfortunately, the public at large seldom allows themselves the opportunity to view older movies for the first time.  If you would like to see far superior films to ""The Blair Witch Project"", I would suggest you rent the original ""The Haunting"" from 1963 >""Curse of the Demon"" from 1957, ""Five Million Years to Earth"" from 1968, and ""Freaks"" from 1932. It's interesting to note that ""Freaks"" was originally panned by the critics and by the public as being depraved yet it is now regarded as a horror classic which was way ahead of its time. I would encourage you to pick up any of the above mentioned videos when you rent ""The Blair Witch Project"" for Halloween.  If you even get the slightest chill from viewing ""The Blair Witch Project"" you'll break out in goosebumps while seeing any of the older and far superior videos."

"Weevlitz","10","1","3","21 September 1999"," Left Breathless
","I'll admit that when I first heard about The Blair Witch Project, it had not blown up into the huge thing that it is now.   It was still relatively quiet, relying on it's own title and mystery to attract viewers.  I went to see this movie the second day it was out.(In it's limited release run)<br/><br/>All I can say is that the reality portrayed in this film is so good that it's frightening.  That's why the movie is scary.  It's not because of what we see or don't see, but how the actors react to what is happening around them.  What's the most important part of acting?  Reacting!  And these three were perfect.  I kept thinking to myself...wow..that's exactly how I would react to that...or ""that's what I would have said.""  I could totally imagine myself with two friends in the same situation reacting the same way.<br/><br/>Sure, the fact that they film to the very end is asking a bit much to believe.  But remember, it IS a movie  There has to be some suspension of disbelief..there is in EVERY movie.  But here's the question that all of you have to ask yourself...let's say you were these film students..you got lost..you lost one of your friends..you were frightened for your life. Most of you would stop filming...I probably would.  However, the filming to the end makes sense to me.  As they get closer to Josh's voice and the climatic scene in the house....what if they saw something, saved their friend...escaped the witch, or whatever it was..and got out alive?  Aside from being grateful that they're alive...they would be forever kicking themselves for not getting the one thing on tape that they set out to get. And so would you.  A serious artist is willing to put everything on the line to get that one important shot that would make everything that they went through worthwhile.  if they hadn't continued filming, and survived???? It would all have been in vain.<br/><br/>This movie didn't really scare me until about an hour afterwards, when I had all that time to think about it.  Imagine yourself in that situation...you WOULD be scared to death.  If you deny that, then you are lying to yourself. This was a brilliant film and a much needed film for the genre that has been dominated by Scream spin-offs.  I thank the director and the actors for such a wonderful piece of work, and I can't wait to own my own copy."

","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]<br/><br/>Why this movie ever has gotten anyone's attention or admiration is a mystery to me.<br/><br/>Before watching I had read about it on the net, in newspaper's and so on. Therefore I was expecting something new, something out of the ordinary, something memorable, but this was just a waste of time. Mostly it reminded me of movies that one of my friends used to produce in his backyard when we were at school and the dialogue in his films was better. That this movie has gotten the attention it has could only happen in the States, I think, where the craving for something new is more pertinent than the craving for something good.<br/><br/>First of all there is nothing remotely scary about it, just three kids in long johns running around in the middle of the night frightening each other. Secondly the 'realism' is plain phony and the story is badly told, nothing hangs together. The quest these kids are undertaking is badly researched, badly prepared and badly executed. The witch never becomes real in any true sense, so the story of her fails to add to the scare. All the things the kids encounter in the woods has the feel of silly pranks and Josh' disappearance makes no sense. Nobody in their right mind would toss the map and nobody in their right mind would follow the female lead anywhere, since she's constantly screaming and commanding the guys around. I surprised they didn't make her disappear instead.<br/><br/>This could perhaps have been a good movie and even a scary one, but it would need some script work, a knowledge of plot structure and better actors, not just a snappy web site or two."

","This has really been the summer of the overhyped-but-failed-to-deliver film. And the Blair Witch Project is a fine example.  With almost no budget, two student filmmakers turn a neat idea into a painfully hard to watch film, in the process wasting some amazing acting talent.  (I'm actually a little curious as to how they spent $35 000 on it!) I'm not surprised that people caught on to it as they did, but just because something is indie doesn't make it good. (And how indie is it when you're on the cover of Time, People, etc??)  The rants and the raves came too much too quickly, and no movie could be expected to fulfill that hype, but still, Blair Witch is contrived, boring, and not at all scary.  I've heard too many comments like ""this is what Hollywood needs to learn"" yada yada yada.  Whatever happened to judging films by what they are not what they aren't.

","This film is unique in its method, which I find to be truly wonderful. However, once the veil of reality is lifted by certain acting choices and post-mortem late-night talk show appearances by the actors, the movie loses its edge entirely. When lost in the woods without food, without direction, and, ultimately, without a traveling companion, one's sense to make a documentary would likely fade in the emerging presence of the overwhelming need to survive. Cans of film wouldn't be hauled around. Batteries for lights wouldn't be hauled around. Cameras would be dropped when punching your buddy who kicks maps into rivers. I love film, and believe in the suspension of disbelief. But when the entire film's meaning rests on the shoulders of people's belief that ""it really happened,"" those responsible for the film can not ruin this effect by crediting ""Director of Photography"" first, appearing on talk shows, and contributing to the media's disintegration of the very veil that makes the film work."

I really wanted to laugh through the entire movie because it was that bad! I found the movie lacking in plot, in dialogue, in, well basically everything!

"chris-501","Null","1","3","23 August 1999"," A great movie which (sadly) many will never appreciate
","!!! SOME SPOILERS IN HERE... DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!!!<br/><br/>I saw The Blair Witch Project a few days ago and I truly believe it is one of the most original and frightening movies I have ever seen. Sadly, based on the comments I have been reading on this and other websites-- the beauty of this movie will go unnoticed by many. <br/><br/>This movie is not trying to play into the American public's expectations. It is NOT supposed to look Aaron Spelling perfect with lighting and framing and clear images. This move is ""supposed"" to be shot by 3 film students. If all of the camera shots were perfectly lighted and the camera was tripod still it would be ludicrous.... for those of you who think the film is ""too shaky"" or ""poorly made,"" keep in mind that this was done ON PURPOSE in order to make the film seem authentic.<br/><br/>For those of you who whine because there's no guts and gore, or cat scares, or digitalized special effects-- I pity you. Assuming that horror as a ""genre"" is only scary or acceptable if it follows the pattern of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street rejects some fabulous movies. Just as every comedy doesn't have to have the same stock elements, horror films can also deviate. This movie was amazing precisely because it DIDN'T buy into the over-played and overdone technique of using blood and guts to scare. Instead, this movie sets up a valid premise and allows this scenario to run to a (semi) logical conclusion.<br/><br/>While everyone's entitled to their own opinion, I find it sad that many people will never accept this movie simply because it doesn't conform to their stock view of what a film ""should be like."" There were ""effects"" before digitalized effects and there are horror movies without a single bit of on screen violence. To reject movies on face because they're different than you might expect is to miss many, many wonderful films.<br/><br/>
For those who are open to something different, this movie might really scare you. It's not SUPPOSED to be like Halloween or Prom Night or similar films... and maybe, if you're open to new ideas-- that's a GOOD THING!"
"nintendo-3","8","1","3","23 August 1999"," As horrifying as you allow it to be.
","When I left to the theater to see the Blair Witch Project, I thought it would be so incredibly horrifying that I would have nightmares for days on end.  However, five minutes into the film, I felt completely natural and at ease.  <br/><br/>Blair Witch is the kind of movie that you would think would gross you out, but there is surprisingly very little gruesome imagery; most of the film's chills are derived from medieval witchcraft that the film-makers come across; and most of all, it's truly what you DON'T see on the camera that will freak you out.<br/><br/>But then again, you won't be really scared until the last ten minutes.  And how scared you'll be depends on your imagination.  The film goes on and on with other things that you find yourself waiting for something to happen. The first half-hour of the film is really just a funny home video (although it is quite enjoyable).  <br/><br/>There's quite a bit of unnecessary language, and the camera is consistently shaking up and down for most of the film.  Of course, this makes Blair Witch's characters and presentation very believable.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project has an interesting approach to the horror genre, it's like NOTHING you've seen before; the satisfying ending will leave on the edge of your seat screaming for more, which makes it a worthy film experience.  <br/><br/>If you want to see a big-budget horror-flick with tremendous special effects - where seeing IS believing, then Blair Witch isn't it.  If you want to see a scary home video or something that's different from other films, then I highly recommend it.  This is a true horror classic."

","I thought the Blair Witch was one of the most freshest and original horror movies every done.  This just proves that less can definitely be more.  Its good to use your imagination for a change, instead of the unnecessary blood and gore being thrown at you on the big screen.  The cinematography, acting skills, as well as the original screen play has convinced me that the cliche horror flicks ie; stalker with mask; chops up beer drinking, sex crazed teenagers; virgin survives; awful sequel follows; days are finally over."

Perhaps the best part about this movie was the way it stays in your head afterwards; being outside after dark will never be the same.  It's also great to see a horror film that doesn't contain gallons and gallons of fake blood and computer-generated monsters that are shown from the outset of the movie - many recent ""horror"" movies could take a great lesson from this one.  I would recommend this film to anyone who's looking for a TRUE scary flick."

","I don't watch horror movies; haven't for years since being terrified by Alien and turning off the TV halfway through it.  But I decided to see The Blair Witch Project with my husband (who likes good horror movies) because of all the amazing hype surrounding the movie, and because I was curious what a couple of barely-out-of-college filmmakers had done that everyone was saying was so creative.  I told my husband I'd probably have to leave mid-way through the movie, since I was prepared to be scared out of my wits. Wrong.  There was not one scary moment in this entire movie.  We both sat there, waiting for the scary stuff to begin, and it never happened.  This was one of the worst, most boring movies I've ever seen.  Yeah, the premise was fairly creative and a good way to make a movie on a $30,000 budget, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a bad movie.  I got really tired of seeing jerky camera footage and the three actors saying the same things over and over (f**k, we're lost!!).  Not to mention the fact that the three characters had a wilderness survival guide and managed not to know that if you're lost in the woods and find a stream of water, you can often follow it to civilization!  Also, they kept filming themselves as they got more and more terrified, and how real is that?  You're awakened in the middle of the night by strange noises (which we couldn't hear well at all in the theater; bad sound effects) in a supposedly haunted woods, and you stop to grab the camera to film everything?  The piles of rocks and stick figures that were supposed to terrify the audience left me yawning.  The people sitting next to us in the theater had the same reaction we did.<br/><br/>This is an example of what Hollywood hype can do for a bad movie and of how critics will grab onto anything remotely different without stopping to really examine whether it's a good film.  Honestly, this movie is like the Emperor with no clothes -- when are critics going to start telling the truth about The Blair Witch Project?  I can't believe the supposed experts, the critics, who are saying that this is one of the scariest movies ever made. What a joke!  At least we saw a matinee and only wasted $8.50.

","The Blair Witch Project is absolutely brilliant in that it affords each individual viewer his or her own film. Because the filmmakers allow us to imagine what we will during the films very creepy quiet and dark moments, we are frightened by that in our imaginations which truly scares us. A common movie ploy is to have some sort of demon use its victim's innermost fears against them. In this case, however, it is not only the characters undergoing this, but also the audience. The greater the viewer's imagination and the more willing the viewer is to give himself over to it, the more he will enjoy the Blair Witch Project."

My son was sick by the time we got out of the film due to the camera moving around continuously.  We were both very much disappointed with the film and felt that the film was hardly worth the money spent on it.  By all indications, it should be one of the most profitable films on record.  We kept thinking all the way through the film that this must stop.<br/><br/>I am a nurse by profession and would like to see a caption added to the film.

","If I could have gotten my money back for this stinker, I would have.  This movie had no plot, no actors, no script, no scares, and absolutely no business being on the big screen.  It was a childish attempt at horror. The ""actors"" made the lines up as they went along and you could tell.  The best they could come up with is ""f"" this and ""f"" that.  That took a whole lot of talent. NOT!  As for the horror factor, three idiots running around the woods with a video camera screaming at each other is not scary.  The way they handled the camera, I'm surprised no one had to leave the theatre to throw up from motion sickness.  You were never shown anything that could actually scare you.  Hand prints on a deserted houses walls is not scary. Noises in the woods barely audible is not scary.  Twigs tied together is not scary.  A chicken heart in a hanky is not scary. What is scary is all the over rated whoopla that has been made about this thing.  What is even scarier is people spending that kind of money to see it.  And finally what frightens me the most is the money I paid.  I wish the witch would have taken me away from the movie.  Oh wait, she couldn't because there wasn't one or at least none the movie showed.  IT STINKS!"

","""Is that it?"" That was my reaction when this movie was over. I couldn't believe it had been hyped so much and offered so little.<br/><br/>One good measure of how good a movie is is how well it pulls you into it. If you lose track of your surroundings and feel like you're a part of the movie, it's probably a pretty good flick. Based on that criterion, this one sucked.<br/><br/>The gimicky hand-held camera shots were nauseating and distracting. Had there been a decent plot and dialog I would have overlooked the seasickness this movie almost induced.<br/><br/>But nothing about it was good. Almost every horror movie I've seen does a better job of bringing you into the movie than this one does. It was really bad. The whole movie I kept waiting for the build-up to end and for the real action to begin. I really wanted to be ""in"" this movie. But it never succeeded.<br/><br/>I suspect viewers under 21 probably enjoy this movie a lot more than older viewers. Unless you really related to the characters...which I didn't...I think it would be hard to feel like you're out in the woods with these actors. On several occasions I checked my watch to see when the movie would be over. That's a REAL bad sign.<br/><br/>Did I say that I didn't like this movie?<br/><br/>I'm particularly annoyed because I WANTED to like it. I'm also annoyed because I could have seen Sixth Sense or any number of other movies, but we chose this one. We don't go to the theater all that often; mostly rent videos. To think we paid $14 to see this when we could have seen something decent gets my goat. Movies should offer a money-back guarantee. Oh well. I got sucked in by the hype. That's show biz.<br/><br/>P.S. Save your money. It's not a good movie!"

The truth about The Blair Witch Project is that it is a brilliant marketing ploy designed to sell a terrible movie. Without all the advertising hype and fake information, to try to make the movie seem like a real documentary, the movie would just be a really bad home video.

Its just another sad product from the amateur video camera trashcan, on the same level as Cops, The Real World, America's (un)Funniest Home Videos, and When Animals Attack. To call this film a ""mockumentary"" is being generous, since it doesnt even resemble a fake documentary. I thought Faces of Death looked more realistic. I don't really blame the filmmakers (forgive the misnomer), after all, they were just trying to find the same instant success that John Carpenter did back in 1978 when he made Halloween on a similar shoestring budget. And they may very well have, but it doesn't excuse the utter senselessness that viewers are forced to endure for 87 minutes.<br/><br/>Like most video programs which feature footchases, this movie has numerous dizzying scenes, with the camera spinning so fast that cinemagoers easily become nauseous. Even I, a veteran of numerous rollercoasters and spinning amusement park rides wanted to honk after the first 15 minutes. Thats about as exciting as it gets, the rest is a silly bore. I was laughing during many of the so called ""scary scenes,"" the screaming, crying, shaking characters, it was all a comical farce.<br/><br/>This movie supposedly cost $28,000 to produce, and thats a relief.

"TragicLad","10","1","3","12 August 1999"," If you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - then this is the film for you.
","Like many, my first exposure to this film came on the internet.  Word of mouth in newsgroups and chatrooms.  ""Can't wait for this film.""  ""It was sooooo scary.""  ""As soon as it's out in theatres, I'm going again.""  I made a mental note to myself - see this Blair Witch Project that everyone's talking about.<br/><br/>And my chance came, as a special advanced midnight screening came to Toronto.  I was all set to hop on the subway and enjoy the show, but then Space happened to run ""Curse of the Blair Witch"".  An examination of the Blair Witch throughout history, told as a straight-faced documentary.  As I understand it, this mockumentary was originally intended to be part of the film - but the filmmakers separated the two, feeling that the footage alone was powerful enough to stand on its own.  Well, ""CotBW"" was fairly powerful in its own right, as I decided to skip the midnight showing.  I'm an atheist with little fear of spooks and ghosts, and I'm a veteran horror film watcher.  It takes a fair bit to put the scare into me, but based on this one hour mockumentary, I had come to the conclusion that leaving this film in the dead of night and making my way home alone was a definite no-no.  I decided to forgo this viewing in favour of seeing it with a group of friends when it reached general release.<br/><br/>A wise choice.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one.  Three filmstudents enter the woods in 1994 to make a documentry on local boogey man, the Blair Witch.  They never returned.  One year later their film is found.  Edited together, it tells the story of their last days.<br/><br/>The film may be disappointing for some.  Unlike the current hollywood trend of ""cgi monsters on parade"", this film sticks with the ""less is more"" school of filmmaking.  It doesn't spoonfeed answers to the audience - no confident scientist or brave police officer to explain bit by bit just how it all fits together.  No denouement to wrap it up in a nice and neat package.  There are no audio or visual cues to inform the viewer of impending danger.  Rather, the filmmakers have chosen a much more intimate approach.  We are forced to take in the information at the same pace the characters receive it.  We see what they see.  We know what they know.  Not all the questions are answered. Even the ending is open to multiple interpretations.<br/><br/>This is a film devoid of effects or any form of Hollywood sparkle - as such, the entire film rests upon the strength of the actors.  Though I'm sure much of what we are seeing is the actors playing themselves, the performances are powerful.  That many are leaving the theatres convinced that what they just witnessed was an actual event is a testament to these actors' abilities.<br/><br/>I would like to think that this film would act as a signal to Hollywood that we don't need multimillion dollar effects and actors to make a successful movie.  All that is needed are good actors and filmmakers who believe in the story they are telling. Alas, I fear the only thing they will take away is ""Hurray, we don't have to pay cameramen any more.""  Be prepared for a wave of really bad mockumentries nipping on the heels of the Blair Witch.<br/><br/>If you like films that provokes thought and discussion, if you are a fan of scary stories, if you've ever been spooked by the thing going bump in the night - than this is the film for you.  Although you may wish to cancel that late summer camping trip.<br/><br/>This film gets five out of five ""Moohoohaha's"" on the scary movie scale. If I were to see this film again, I'd pay as much as $10."

"mcj-2","10","1","3","12 August 1999"," Depends on the viewer
","How much a viewer likes this movie depends on his or her personal taste (duh).  If you thought Alien was far better than Aliens, chances are you'd be more inclined to like this movie.  Same with Jaws vs. all the sequels. This movie is all about suggestion.  You never SEE anything, and that lets your imagination runs wild.<br/><br/>Another viewer characteristic that makes this movie more enjoyable is the ability to put yourself into the movie characters' situation.  That is what I think makes this the most scary movie I have ever seen.  For example, I think Alien was a great movie, but that situation will most likely never ever happen to me.  Blair Witch, though...I have been camping, and I have heard noises coming from the woods.  I know that can be spooky, even if it goes away immediately.  In those scenes where they were shining the lights on the cameras out the opening in the tent, I felt like I was right there with them, straining to find anything in the blackness.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think this is a really great film, because it is the first one to actually scare me.  Most films that attempt to be scary end up just being funny, but not this one.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more characteristic that it would help to have to really enjoy this movie...a strong stomach.  (:"
"baumer","10","1","3","12 August 1999"," My final comment about Blair Witch
","Warning may be some spoilers<br/><br/>Okay, by now I think many have seen the film and there seems to be quite the split about how great it is.  I for one loved this film.  I love that it was original ( and I say that knowing there are films out there like Cannibal Hollocaust and the Last Broadcast ), I love that it was documentary style, I love that it made you use your imagination and I loved the three actors in it. But I do have a few comments to make regarding the criticism.<br/><br/>First off, the Blair Witch Project was a small film that like El Mariachi and Clerks was just hoping to get a video deal or perhaps a cable deal to recoup there budget.  So to say that this was film was over-hyped is a bit of a fallacy.  To me over hype is when a studio comes out and says a film that has been out for a few days ( take any Disney animated film ) is already a classic.  That is hype.  But when a film that no one really thought much of takes the film world by storm and it is us, the paying audience that gives it the kudos that it deserves, that is not hype, that is word of mouth.  So to say that this is a bad film because it was over hyped is just rubbish.  These two guys ( Sanchez and Myrick ) at the very least had an innovative idea and took what they remember as being scary from the classic horror films, and they combined it all into one scary-as-hell-play-with-your-mind-psychologically-tormenting-movie.  So it is not over hyped.<br/><br/>Secondly) I can understand why some people don't like this film.  I know it is not for every taste.  But please stop and listen to yourselves when you do criticize it.  The majority of the people that don't like it say the same thing.  ""Where's the witch?""  ""The only thing scary about this is that I spent 10 bucks on it.""  "" Borrrrring.""  Well if that is how you feel, then that is how you feel, but the least you could do is try to elaborate why it is that you feel the way you do about this film.  And also try to realize that perhaps the reason you are not scared or at least tense in the film is not because it isn't well made, it is just probably that you don't fear the same things that some of the rest of us do.  This film relies solely on playing with people's minds, and it did a hell of a job with mine.<br/><br/>Finally, I love this film.  I love everything about it.  I think it is the best film that I have seen this summer and I admire the two directors for doing what they did.  To make a film that concentrates on atmosphere and mind games instead of blood and gore is a true testament to how much they must love the genre.  Think of classic Carpenter and Hitchcock.  They did much of the same thing.  There was hardly any blood in the shower scene in Psycho and very little in Halloween.  Blair Witch also has but one scene with blood in it, and yet it is one of the most effective scenes in the film because you are shocked by it.<br/><br/>To people that don't enjoy this film, I honestly have pity for you, and I do not mean that in a pretentious ""I'm better than you"" kind of way.  I know we all have different tastes in horror films and that is okay, but if you could just feel the raw fear and experience that strange sensation when your heart races at the end of the film, or to actually go camping and stare into the darkness and wonder what that snapping twig is about ten feet away from you, you would really thank the guys for making this.  I love that this film could do that to me.  I love that it could get inside me like that.  And it's too bad that those of you that didn't feel that way, could, just for one moment.  That to me, is the power of film making.  To manipulate somone's emotions the way this film does is a treasure unto itself.<br/><br/>Psycho had people in their generation always looking out of the shower. Jaws kept us out of the water.  Halloween kept us afraid of the night. Nightmare on Elm Street kept some of us from falling asleep.  Blair Witch will give you a paranoia about camping, for those of you that like the film that is.  My humble opinion, this is a 10/10.  When people ask me what the scariest horror films I've ever seen are, I will respond with Halloween, Jaws, Nightmare On Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left, Evil Dead, Amittyville Horror and the newest entry, The Blair Witch Project.  To me, and to many others, it is the epitome of fear.  And I love to be scared."

","I saw this movie on the opening day at 1:45 in the afternoon in a sold-out theater in an audience of college film students. Okay...you know what? I was scared. Yes, I realize how some people could definitely be disappointed in this film. It's a low-budget movie with great ideas and minimal resources...but I thought that it was GREAT. It's a BRILLIANT concept. Now that the film is becoming more and more hyped, I KNOW that there is going to be some serious backlash about this film not being scary enough...but I've just got to say: ALLOW yourself to be sucked into the idea...you're lost in the middle of the woods...you hear voices and screaming outside of your tent...you get progressively more hungry, tired, and frantic as the days wear on and you lose hope...it's SCARY!!! I think that the best part of this film is the way in which we get to see these three characters just absolutely LOSE IT. Now, granted, sitting in a movie theater surrounded by tons of people, knowing that I would be able to go out into the bright sunlight when the movie was over....yes, that makes the movie less scary. But the point for me was just the fact that these three kids just completely lose their minds and their humanity in the middle of the woods. Just think about it...these three kids disappear and then a year later you find their footage: it's not about scary stick figures hanging in trees or creepy voices in the middle of the night. It's about three kids completely losing their humanity and desperately searching for ANYTHING to cling to. I thought that the ending was terrifying. And I thought that it was terrifying not only due to the creepy situation they find themselves in at the end of the movie...but even more so because these kids were just sick with terror and had lost all hope!!!

","While this movie didn't live up to the months of hype given to it, it was the best movie I've seen all summer. It wasn't absolutely and obvioulsy frightening, but there's an awful lot to be said about a film that messes with your mind and sticks with you for days, like this one.<br/><br/>The first 1:20 of this movie is actually, contrary to some reviews I've read, a great job of character development, as each actor changes due to their experiences. I haven't seen such dynamic and profound changes in characters since I saw Deliverance for the first time this summer (yes, I know the connection there, and I'm not entirely sure it's just a coincidence), while the final 10 minutes is some of the best horror cineamatography (sp?) I've ever seen. It's more frightening than the entire remake of The Haunting.<br/><br/>Sure, as some have complained the actors aren't the greatest ever, but this is their first movie and, lest we forget, they're not exactly ""acting"" either. Most of what you see in the movie are their real reactions to what's going on around them, reactions that most people would come close to if put in the same situation.<br/><br/>Another ""problem"" that people have tried to blow out of proportion is the quality of the filming, again without taking into consideration what was actually going on. The actors only had an 8mm and a 16mm camera to film with, and even if they were film students, they were ""students, and not accomplished filmmakers, so the level of lighting, sound and filming wouldn't be the greatest.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, in all facets of filmmaking. While parts of it could conceivably be better, the movie as a whole is as close to perfectly done as you can get."

","This was marketed very well by the internet and word-of-mouth as ""found footage"", many people at first thought it was real, obviously this turned out to be untrue, it was a low-budget movie ($40,000) with no stars, no special effects and no gimmicks, but it proved a box office sensation. Basically in 1994, three student filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Joshua 'Josh' Leonard and Michael 'Mike' Williams (all using their own names) started a ""documentary"" interviewing the people of Burkittsville, Maryland, formerly named Blair, to hear their views and opinions of the local legend, of the ""Blair Witch"". They plan to travel to the woods and find evidence of the legend, they carry with them camping gear, a map and their video cameras. Soon after starting their trek however they get lost, they find themselves going around in circles, the map is lost, they hear strange noises in the dark, and in the daylight they find strange piles of rocks and wood symbols hanging in the trees. Josh is separated and disappears, Heather famously sobs (with lots of snot) about their impending doom, she and Mike realise that something is out there and tormenting or hunting them, and they both eventually meet their fate in a secluded and dilapidated house. All the footage and sound captured by the cameras was ""discovered"" in the woods a year later, this is what the viewer is watching. Away from the hype surrounding the film at the time, it proves that even the simplest of films, with improvised acting and action, shaky camera- work and no explicit material (you never see any monster), can become a cinema landmark. Cannibal Holocaust may have been the first ""found footage"" horror film, but this broke new ground, there would certainly be no Paranormal Activity or Cloverfield without this film, and it is genuinely freaky to watch, a terrific independent psychological horror. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!"

","I just cannot understand why anyone likes this film. The whole premise of 'found footage' genre is flawed, for example, would you still be holding a camera and filming if you were running away from someone or something? One other film that uses this genre is Cloverfield and I cannot get over the fact that you would be fleeing from a so called monster (that you never really see properly by the way) and still filming! Think about it - would you really be doing this? Also, surely the whole point of cinema is photography, how things look, putting images on screen, with The Blair Witch Project most of the film is in darkness, you can hardly see anything most of the time, what is the point of film in this case? If the screaming and whining is scary (I just think it is highly annoying) to you, it might as well have been broadcast on the radio. One of the other reviewers stated that without BWP there would not be other found footage films, this is probably true, but that is nothing to be celebrated! The only one of the found footage genre that I find remotely scary is Paranormal Activity and I think that in this case it works, because the scary in this film is supposed to be a ghost, something we can't necessarily see, and there are static cameras around the house, which you may have in your home for security reasons, this makes the premise all the more acceptable and believable. The cameras just happen to 'catch' or 'capture' unusual events or happenings as they occur. I must admit I was scared by these movies and the addition of times and dates made the films seem more real like it had actually happened. I am not knocking BWP for being low budget, there have been plenty of excellent low budget movies over the years, eg I don't think Jaws or Halloween had very big budgets, BUT I would like something to see for my money! Personally I think people fell for the hype, it was a very clever marketing ploy by the makers of this film to pretend that the Blair Witch legend was real and even that the found footage was 'real' and not a movie at all, more of a documentary! Please do not remake this film in 10 or 20 years time, once was enough!"

","The Blair Witch Project follows a group of students who embark on a trip through the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and the horrors which ensue when they decide to do this. <br/><br/>For starters, the acting is all pretty fantastic. All three main actors are great, and in a role like this where they spend most of it beaten down and losing themselves, it really is impressive. Each one of surprisingly genuine, and it's clear that each actor was passionate about this project.<br/><br/>The characters they play are fleshed out and realistic. They talk like real people right from the get-go, and it makes it so much easier to relate to and get behind these characters as real students. Throughout the movie the characters are pushed, and they react in ways you'd expect most of the time. There is one scene where the movie creates unnecessary conflict for itself, where a certain fact would've been better left untold. Otherwise, the writing and characters are very well done. <br/><br/>There are several scenes where the camera is pointed right at the ground and we as the audience can do nothing but sit and listen to the characters. Being a found-footage film, this works very well. First of all, the characters aren't always going to be pointing their camera at whatever they are looking at. It just doesn't make sense, especially in this situation. It also adds a lot to the atmosphere, where we as the audience often live in silent, unknowing terror. We can't see anything, but we can hear the characters talking. While they don't really see much either, it still leaves a lot to the imagination with the limitation of the camera lens. In fact, the movie shows very little even when the characters are pointing the camera where they're looking, and again it creates great atmosphere. You never know what's going to happen next, and in the end you just kind of have to figure it out yourself. It becomes more terrifying without the full knowledge of what exactly is going on, and that is where this movie particularly excels. <br/><br/>Supposedly there was a scene where the camera was supposed to turn and see the Blair Witch standing on a hill, but whoever had the camera at the time didn't do that and it was kept in the final cut, which is in a way more terrifying. We don't know what they saw, and in that way it also leaves more up to the imagination and more to interpret. <br/><br/>Overall The Blair Witch Project is pretty terrifying, and yet it's well-acted, well-written, and just overall well made. I can count about one part where I really didn't like it, but it still makes some sense at least. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."
"lralberg","9","1","4","30 November 2016"," A truly terrifying film
","The Blair Witch Project is, in my opinion, one of the best horror movies due to it's realistic setting and eerie environment. The found footage format makes the scares unpredictable and terrifying. <br/><br/>The film follows three people on a mission to learn about the Blair Witch, an urban legend of sorts in the woods of Maryland. It is shot entirely with hand-held cameras and equipment that would realistically be used for a low budget documentary like the one Heather, Josh, and Mike are trying to make. It almost feels like you're actually there in the woods since the camera shows the characters' perspectives.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most terrifying moments are when the characters see something but the camera is facing away so the audience can't see what they saw. The mystery is one of the most compelling aspects of the film. The characters aren't focusing on getting the perfect shot when they're running or scared, so the camera ends up showing their feet or the blurry scenery. This creates a very disorienting feeling that adds to the ambiance.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of subtlety. Plot points are briefly mentioned by characters who are interviewed or one of the main three throughout. As the mystery of the woods is slowly revealed, you can see more and more references to the urban legend found throughout the woods. Some things you won't even notice unless you re watch the film a few times. It's especially scary when the characters don't notice certain connections to the legend that are playing out around them.<br/><br/>All three main actors do an excellent job acting naturally as if it isn't a movie at all. Their reactions seem very genuine and real. In some parts their reactions actually very real, since the director told them very little and would leave them alone in the woods for periods of time. The dedication to creating a realistic horror film is truly astounding. <br/><br/>The final scene is one of the most terrifying moments in the film. Josh's screaming is heard while Mike and Heather run through a creepy house. Viewers are terrified about what will be around each corner. The film then ends with Mike going into the basement and dropping his camera. Heather then enters the basement to see Mike facing the corner- a reference to the Rustin Parr story mentioned earlier- and she is knocked to the ground. The camera runs for a minute and stops. This ambiguous ending leaves so many questions and makes for an excellently terrifying end to the film. <br/><br/>The Blair Witch project created a truly terrifying atmosphere that remains scary to this day. I have yet to watch a film that comes close to the level of eeriness in Blair Witch. This is a classic horror film that is guaranteed to leave audiences feeling uneasy for years to come."

","The Blair witch Project is a new,experimental and in my personal opinion successfully executed film. It delves into the unexplored world of simplicity and complete hand-held camera shots which is very undermined by most horrors which rely heavily on dramatic music and unnecessary jump scares to force viewers admitting they were scared by at least one scene in the movie. The Blair witch Project has no jump scares. No intense and over the top music. No ridiculous CGI monsters or ghosts. And no fancy camera quality. The film scares you to bone with a terrifying story line without even revealing the witch cursing the forest, Clever uses of environment, noises and lighting. But the most scariest thing about this film is that it can very much be mistaken as potentially real due to its theme of basic raw footage filmed from the character's perspective. Besides a few scenes in which acting is poorly executed, the movie easily scared me with its amazing build up and simple yet effective use of paranormal activity occurring around the characters particularly at night. I find it easily understandable as to why some people may find this as a bad way of creating a movie. But if your'e searching for something new and different from every other horror out there this is certainly an option."
"SnoopyStyle","6","1","4","4 October 2014"," Birth of a sub-genre
","In October 1994, three film students Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams (their real names) disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland. A year later, their cameras are found. There is a local legend of The Blair Witch and missing children. They were there to do a documentary.<br/><br/>This is the granddaddy of the found footage movies. This could be scary if the audience buys into the film as real. I didn't and it's not scary for me. It's a little too shaky and rambling. I am reminded of Michael Moore talking about what a revelation the tripod is. Also the start is excruciatingly slow. It's an interesting idea that birthed a whole new genre. That's no easy task. However, it achieves very little more than that for me. It is more dizzying than frightening."

","Is it the point that nothing happens? No. Is it the story about the blair witch project? No. Is it the visuals?

Talking to people, walking trough the woods, great backstory!<br/><br/>But it's the way they portrayed these teenagers. Our protagonist is a girl who does nothing else than showing off how great she is, being a real bitch to her friends and not helping anyone at all. <br/><br/>The two other characters are just her friends. A bit stereotypical. We got a tech guy who handles the camera and another guy who has no real use whatsoever but complain about the situation.<br/><br/>In fact, i hated the acting so much i actually wanted them to die! Just to get rid of their awful childish discussions about a map. A MAP! These kids are being followed by a creature out of mythical lore and the best thing they find to worry about is the goddamn map and the fact they ran out of cigarettes!<br/><br/>I don't care nothing really happens. But it's because nothing really happens we have to focus on the characters so much. And that's the reason this movie fails to satisfy."

"bakers4","10","1","4","18 June 2013"," Ultimate - almost like Val Lewton on steroids does Gen-X
","Horror film has long faced a fork in its story-telling road, a choice of which way to go. Universal Studios went with fantasy as basis of horror, nightmarish monsters - visually striking makeup design and execution. Settings featured vaguely fictional European landscapes of a past century mostly, as imagined. At RKO, Val Lewton took the 'horror movie' idea into an opposite direction, with stories set in modern era, and often familiar non- fictional places (New York, etc). And as the source of fear and horror, the unseen - what might be lurking in shadows, things suggested without certainty, leaving doubt, room for the worst imaginings - namely, the stuff that scares us in real life.<br/><br/>BLAIR WITCH would make Val Lewton smile. It offers no 'monster' or visual spectacle involving effects. Instead, fear emerges in a progression from the psychological to the supernatural, and with marvelous dramatic credibility. The film slowly builds intensity, and pulls it off with superb subtlety, from merest undercurrents of tension between characters who (in the scenario) are only just meeting, and with no prior acquaintance, team up to take on more than any of them are prepared for. Its pure story-telling, and brilliant as such. The 'script' (improv-based, I understand), actors and director deserve awards. <br/><br/>If you've ever camped in woods, and heard the type sounds coming from various distances in the dark, you're well prepared for one level of scares in this film. But BLAIR WITCH hits its stride in a deepening progression of scare levels. It proceeds from frightening realities - (lost in the woods, a survival situation emerging) - to possibilities of harm to life and limb by human intent ('Deliverance'-style deep woods yokels suspected)) - to horror of supernatural scope and scale, undeniably evil and violent. <br/><br/>Throughout the story arc, an air of doom gathers with increasing loss of control over circumstances the protagonists encounter, some just bad luck, others self-fostered. Indeed, the dysfunctional nature of peer relations and communication, is a foundation of everything that happens to our unfortunate principles. I've wondered if this ties in with the intensely negative reaction this film evokes for some - rightly puzzled at by various reviewers here more, shall we say - appreciative (or perceptive)? BLAIR WITCH panders to no pretensions, such as seem to preoccupy some tastes, and perhaps prejudice or constrain some reviews. BLAIR WITCH is a film with richness and many story aspects. But its not about whether its characters are suitably 'likeable' (as TV show film critics sometimes seem to expect), or proper 'role models' for any children in the audience, or ... etc. <br/><br/>What this film does instead, is offer credible characters, whose tendencies we recognize from real life and don't necessarily admire. The movies is less about 'liking' its principals, than believing what we're seeing as shown and told. And instead of giving us cardboard 'good guys' or 'bad' it gives us people who seem very real, and for whom we're inclined to feel different things in turn. The film portrays its protagonists as neither reprehensible, nor charismatic, inviting us neither to love nor hate them - only to feel the terror they undergo, and without any distraction of 'not believable.' Indeed, there's a contagiously realistic emotional quality to Heather's loss of control when she screams, with neither her nor us knowing what it is she's facing. We don't have to know what's going on, to be scared by it - in fact, the greater the unknown factor, the more unleashed the imagination, the more bewildering the fear. This is an awesome movie for discriminating, mature, no-nonsense tastes in unique horror film approaches, to be savored and viewed over and again.<br/><br/>Never before has the ""Lewton"" method - using shadows, the unseen, imagination taken past bounds of what's known, believed, imaginable, in context of things hinted at, power of suggestion etc. - been taken to such heights, and with such overwhelming effect. One of the greatest and most common weaknesses or failures of horror film, in general, is the lack of mental breakdown and stress that would probably occur in real life, if one were faced with some supernatural evil. Horror films most often dramatize only minimal psychological impact on their characters, after encounters with insurmountable horrors. Among BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's most admirable triumphs is its realistic depiction, and harnessing as an energy source driving story - of the toll taken upon the characters by the traumatic nature of the experience, as it unfolds, of their encounter with implacable horror. No spoiler to say they don't come back the same, I hope ... heh heh."

","Opening in 1999, The Blair Witch Project became a hit with critics and audiences. In my point of view, The Blair Witch Project is the most smartest and most frightening movie of all of the horror movies. In October 1994, three students go in the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. But, what they don't know is that the Blair Witch is stalking them. Though the movie is filmed completely on a hand-held camera, it does do a good job keeping track of the suspense. The Blair Witch Project also has a ultimate touch on reality and technology. In one of the scenes, one of the students say that reality isn't really real anyway when you see it. That is a very excellent set up of the whole picture. To create the illusion of suspense just by seeing a unknown object that is terrifying and intimidating. The end of the movie is probably the creepiest scene of all. With good acting from the students and good writing, The Blair Witch Project is a good-natured horror movie. Thumbs Up. ★★★★ 4 stars."

","Blair Witch certainly is one of the polorizing movies. There is almost no middle ground when it comes to this film, you either love it, or hate it. For me, I'm on the love side. It certainly isn't the scariest film I've ever seen, but I love it's creativity and atmosphere that I'm willing to overlook it's flaws.<br/><br/>This is not a jump scare type of horror film, it fact throughout most of the movie it doesn't really try to SCARE you really, it mostly tries to creep you out. So if you are not a patient person, and believe me, I'm not the most patient person in the world either, than you will hate this film. It can be very tedious at times, and kind of boring. Plus I think we needed at least one more day before the crew started going crazy, but maybe that's just me. And don't watch it with a headache, I did that and I wanted to vomit.<br/><br/>What it does do well it make a realistic atmosphere. There are people who still believe this was real, showing how realistic this movie is. The characters, aren't really characters, they're real people. No really, not only are all the actors using their real names, but the directors didn't really give them a full script, they told the actors that the legend was real and would actually make noises to freak them out to make this as realistic as possible. And because of that, I felt sympathy for these three even though they were all kind of a$$holes. Their not movie a$$holes, they're real people a$$holes, and yes there's a difference. And the film has a sense of humor to it, this is actually kind of personal as when something bad happens to me I will sometimes try to add a little humor to the situation to make it seem less bad.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is not the scariest film ever made, it's more of a creepy film. What it does best is create a realistic atmosphere and characters that you can sympathise with, and leads to one of the best ending of all time, that leaves a bit up to the imagination. Plus, the backstory to this witch is very detailed and well thought out.<br/><br/>8/10"

","We all know the laughable gimmick attached to this thing that was foisted when this came out. ""A camera with footage of three missing teens was found in the forest."" We were supposed to believe the three had been filming a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch haunting. The whole bit of trying to look like actual footage made by inexperienced camera operators was so contrived and overdone that its fake nature was almost insulting. How could they actually think this junk could fool anyone? ""Missing film makers?"" Right. It's no wonder anybody involved with this shoddy nonsense disappeared.<br/><br/>""Overdone"" is an understatement. Every two seconds, the view jostles around, and the camera is aimed at nothing while stuff goes on off screen. You get the corny cliché of fleeting, rapid panning movements that just show wild flashes. It reminded me of that hoax footage that was supposedly of a live Sasquatch taking an afternoon stroll through the forest. The pseudo-documentary approach looks more like a cheap reality show. ""Interviewees"" say dumb stuff, which tells nothing. Forget about any insights to the Witch herself. What you will see besides leaves on the ground is the endless f-bomb arguing of these mindless brats, culminating with the classic scene of a bad actress framed conveniently in the exact corner (accidentally, right, ha ha) as she sniffs her way through a meandering apology to everyone from her folks to her pet parakeet. I rooted for the witch to shut them all up.<br/><br/>Oh, and be on the lookout for the one of the greatest cop-out non-ending endings you'll ever see.

"maiira","8","1","4","29 May 2006"," A truly unsettling film...
","I do not usually feel compelled to write reviews on this site, but for this film, I felt I had to say something. I don't entirely know what counts as a ""spoiler"" in this film, but I'm going to mark this review as having them, just in case.<br/><br/>For the first thirty minutes, we see Heather (the bossy director of the project and principal camera operator), Josh (Heather's friend and secondary camera operator), and Mike (the sound guy) doing some half-hearted interviews, and goofing off. Heather, it seems, isn't a very good documentarian, or interviewer (I kept wanting to tell her to shut up and let the interviewees speak, instead of interrupting them with her own ideas half the time). After a night of drinking, they start out into the woods. Then, at around thirty minutes into the film, some things start to happen. The group gets lost. They lose their map. Their food and cigarette supplies dwindle. Their tempers run high. And, worst of all, they start seeing strange sights, and hearing strange noises at night. Gradually, all of them start to lose their minds. When one of the group disappears completely, it marks the end of the project, and the beginning of the group's fight for survival, which the viewer already knows they will lose. And in the last ten minutes...well, I'm not even going to say what happens in the last ten minutes. It's intense, terrifying, and very ambiguous.<br/><br/>If I had never had any sort of experience with the outdoors, I doubt I would have been affected by this film at all. But since I have been camping many times, I was perfectly able to put myself in the three filmmaker's exact situation, and I know exactly how I would react if I ever experienced what they did (which is to say, I would sh*t my pants and die of fright). That is why this film is so scary. I remember what it is like to be outside, in the woods, at night, away from everything and everyone you know, sleeping in a tent. Your tent, once seen as a thing of comfort, now seems woefully insufficient as a shelter when you consider how thin it is, and how lightweight. If someone, or something, wanted to come in, it most assuredly could, any time it wanted to. It is dark, and cold outside, and every single noise is magnified many times. A single deer ambling outside the tent sounds like a herd of elephants. Now add in the fact that you're lost, hungry, and being stalked by an unseen supernatural being or force, which you can neither see nor control. It's a very sobering thought. With this film, it's what you don't see that is far more terrifying than what you do see. The ""witch"" is never shown, so you're forced to use your imagination. Even if you're not initially frightened by the film, you're hearing noises and looking over your shoulder afterwards.<br/><br/>So, for those of you who were not scared by this film, I suggest you go out camping out in the woods sometime. If you do that and you still say the film isn't scary, I say you're a big fat liar. This film is scary. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."

","I tend to like to sneak some liquor in when I go to the theater - makes me feel more like I'm watching it at home but on a bigger screen and usually makes the screening process more enjoyable...not so with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. This film had more shakes then a Tijuana hooker. I literally felt sea-sick from all the shaky camera-work (the cheap bourbon may have played a part too - but I doubt it...). I know this was a micro-budget film and that the ""real"" feel is supposed to be what makes this films so ""great"" - it just made my stomach hurt.<br/><br/>This one is about a group of kids who venture into the woods of Frederick County, Maryland (where I just so happen to reside...) in search of some mythical witch. There's also some side-story about a crazy old guy that abducts kids, but honestly, it's been so long since I've seen this one that I don't even remember what that whole thing was about. In fact, I've lived here for quite a while and have never heard anything about any Blair Witch in the first place, but that's another story. The kids go into the woods and they disappear, and the premise of the film is that what the audience sees is the ""found footage"" (much like the basic storyline of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST)...<br/><br/>The same reason that I give this film credit is the very same reason that I hate it - MARKETING. This film had the most ingenious marketing techniques and ""hyping"" that I've ever personally witnessed for a theatrical release. The endless bombardment of commercials, the ""true"" documentaries - everything about how this film was marketed was absolutely brilliant. Which brings me to my major gripe with the film...It didn't live up to the hype. The first two-thirds of the film is boring footage of the three adventurers getting ready for their trip, and then walking in circles in the woods - all shot through a hand held camera that looks as though the person holding it has Parkinson's disease. The very end of the film is relatively ""creepy"", but I couldn't figure out how it tied in to the rest, and honestly don't care to bother trying to piece it together.<br/><br/>I give the filmmakers credit for pulling off such a hugely successful film with no budget, and I like the idea of an independent film being shown theatrically - but THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT just wasn't scary, and in my opinion is THE MOST over-hyped film I've ever seen. 3/10"

While some people may the camera shaking, going out of focus and such annoying, it all adds to the 'realness' of the concept that you as a viewer are meant to be buying into. It's not fair to take away ratings points based on 'poor production quality', 'not many special effects', 'no big-name actors', or the way in which the film was marketed.<br/><br/>Instead, the story is intriguing, and while it has its moments of 'less interesting' dialog, generally for much of the 84-minute running time, you are kept on the edge of your seat, or perhaps for some, hiding behind it! The premise of the film is simple, and so not much really happens (""it's about these kids who get lost in a scary forest"" - true), but that's exactly why TBWP works. The film didn't need to be complicated, and it isn't - all it needed was a few 'setbacks' or 'issues' for the kids come across, and the film delivers.<br/><br/>On the downside, I do recall feeling at the time of my first viewing that the film was possibly too short, if anything. There are instances where you might say to yourself (or to others watching with you) ""they can't be that stupid, can they?"" -- but hey, the world is full of stupid people - and hey, not everyone goes to scouts and learns what you can do to help you get your bearings if you get lost in the woods..<br/><br/>I gave the film a 7 out of 10, though I wish IMDb allowed 1/2-pts as I feel a 7.5 is where this film is at. TBWP is not the best film ever, but it is one I would certainly recommend seeing."

","One summer in 1994 three student went on a trip to the Maryland woods to do a documentary about a local witch legend. After interviewing some people in the nearby town they head off into the woods and soon realize they got more than what they bargained for.<br/><br/>The film is shown completely through the character's cameras and you really get the feeling you are watching a documentary. The grainy images and shaky camera really make it seem like this is some amateur student project. Obviously the whole thing was made on a low budget, but hardly ever has a production so effectively exploited its own limitations to deliver a film. The first-person perspective puts you right out into the woods and you are essentially perceiving the horror unfold through a victim's eyes and ears. This is often annoying, as by the time the film is through you'll be craving for some answers to all the spooky goings on, but the cleverness of this film cannot be denied.<br/><br/>Also clever was the ad campaign for this film which made it seem like this was a real documentary or at least a recreation of real events. Many believed it for a time, I know, because I was one of those people. By the time I view the film I knew it was all a fake. A hoax as some would call it, but I believe that ""hoax"" is the wrong word here: ""phenomenon"" is much more suitable. More suitable, because that is what this production created, not just a horror film, but utter Blair Witch craze; from books on the ""legend"" to video games and even a modest budget sequel. I think many people felt cheated when they found out that the Blair Witch was all orchestrated and I did too, but I think it should be viewed as part of the fun and not some let down. Once again, there cleverness of this film is virtually undeniable.<br/><br/>Years back there were some infamous Italian horror films like the terrifying ""Cannibal Holocaust"" which also made use of the documentary look and orchestrated hype about ""this really happened."" Though Cannibal Holocaust was more convincing (the production team was arrested and had to prove in court that horrifying film was just a movie), this is still a very worthy addition the horror genre. Even if all the hype is set aside. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R: profanity"

","I found it pretty boring to be honest. I couldn't quite see why they used a black and white camera as well as a normal colour video camera as all it seemed to do was make it harder to understand what was going on. The plot is pretty basic and they didn't really seem to bother with suspense at all. I can understand that it is good for the budget and number of people involved in the project but I simply don't think its worth buying or renting because its not that good a film. As I said in the summary, Midsommer murders, a British TV crime production, is more scary which isn't saying all that much as it is more scary than a lot of horror. Still maybe I'm being a bit harsh. The acting is good and the characters feel like real people even if they still aren't the brightest of people.

This piece of garbage is filled with weak acting performances all around. As a horror film, it is about as scary as the comedy, See No Evil Hear No Evil. The script is definitely not written by Robert Bolt (Lawrence of Arabia). The cinematography is so unsteady that the cameraman had to be Muhammad Ali or Pope John Paul II.

BWP is a small, mediocre film that is not without it's pleasures (I enjoyed it), but it hardly deserves the praise that has been laden upon it.  It is certainly not the most frightening movie ever, nor is it particularly original, nor a genre breakthrough.  The film makers took an intriguing idea and made a modest, flawed, dull student film.  The general conceit is doubtlessly lifted from the superior Cannibal Holocaust, a film which is not only more frightening, but which manages a thematic layering that is much more deserving of the label ""genre breaking.""  BWP is not terrible.  It is entertaining, largely due to the excellent actors... Heather is especially good, managing sympathy for a truly dislikeable character.  The other plus in this film (here I agree with the seeming majority) is that memorable final sequence.  But even THAT lifts its tension build from the ending of Psycho.  Lifts it very well, mind you.  Had the script been more carefully drawn out, preventing disbelief from being weighed to the ground by a number of motivational inconsitencies, this might have been a troubling and effective film.  Incorporating the documentary's documentary from the Sci-Fi channel advertisement wouldn't have hurt either. Every person I've met off-line has cited the films shortcomings and their disappointment.

","My friend and I saw two of the more anticipated movies of the year (1999)in the same night; Eyes Wide Shut and Blair Witch Project, and I don't think I could have found two better examples of the opposite extremes of filmmaking. Blair Witch, for all its hype is disappointing and even insulting at times. Granted, the core performances are very convincing however much of what they do doesn't make any sense at all. The film's key distinction is essentially that it looks bad with lots of hand-jerky motions which only serve to make one dizzy. There is little real story to the movie and suffice to say the movie feels improvised and off the cuff and subsequently amateurish. The only facinating aspect to this movie is how in the world it could have generated so much hype. The theatre I went to was a packed house while the EWS was only half full (both were good-sized theatres). I honestly don't know how such a badly-filmed inconsequentail film could steal thunder from the genius of Kubrick. Blair Witch commits the worst crime for a horror film; it doesn't scare. It doesn't even tease us with a scare. Its just boring. For all those critics who compared it with the Exorcist I can only imagine they meant Exorcist II.

Once ""certain"" moviegoers get it in their head that a movie is going to be great, and scary, and wonderful, and all of that -- they will almost be hypnotized into thinking the movie is all it is cracked up to be. They will walk out and parrot everything they've heard everyone else say -- because it's the concensus and it is easier than going against the grain. Right now, it is apparently ""hip"" to really dig this movie, and say you've seen it and loved it. Well, believe me -- it is truly underwhelming.

""Oh no!

This could've been 20 minutes long, and it would have been an excellent short film. But they stretched it out, and in between the So so opening and the Ok ending they put in a lot of crapola. Too much screaming, which is obviously the directors' strained attempts at coercing the audience into feeling tense and scared, and too much walking around feigning being lost.<br/><br/>After watching the ""footage"" (which was the scariest thing about the film -- because of how darn shaky and nausiating it was!), all I could ask myself was ""Wouldn't these idiots put down their cameras if they knew they were being hunted?"" DUH! Come on! It was so obvious the filmmakers kept finding ways to make it plausable that they would continue shooting so that the ""being there"" aspect would work. It didn't. Especially the part when the girl is shooting the left side of her face -- with a light on -- even after they had talked about not having any lights on so they wouldn't be found. I mean, it is so silly and utterly unrealistic to be filming yourself if you think you are going to die. Who the F- cares if it turns out cool in your student film project, that is if you make it out of the woods alive!? A thoroughly uninteresting film, and not scary at all! What is scary is that someone would actually call this one of the best horror movies ever. I even read that someone thought it was one of thhe best films ever!? There are far more scary films out there. Don't get me wrong, I think the ""realistic"" horror film is far far scarier, and more respectable then the easy road of blood n' guts -- but this...this is just silly. Rent ""The Silence of the Lambs"" - a truly scary film that doesn't even fall in the horror genre. Or possibly ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" or even ""Peeping Tom"" These are scary films.

","I've read so many positive reviews of this movie since I got back from watching it, and all I can say is, huh? My God, this movie is not terrifying, scary, or even close to it. If anything the movie is a psychological drama that doesn't work due to the sheer stupidity of the characters the actors play. You don't sympathize with them at all, the plight they experience is completely the fault of the Heather and Mike characters. The only people who will find this movie scary are those who think ""Scream"" is the benchmark for horror in films. Heather Donahue's performance doesn't even come close to creating a suspension of disbelief in the audience. She's much too melodramatic for the film. The film primarily consists of arguments at Heather's character (All the characters in the movie have the same names as the actors playing them, probably so that when they break character it doesn't seem like they do), arguments between Mike and Heather, and more arguments. I watched this film at The Nuart in Los Angeles and when the credits started to roll at the end, the audience broke out in boos and hisses. The movie builds up for over an hour to a horribly lame conclusion that is supposed to seem psychologically disturbing but comes off as anti-climactic. The scenes where the actors rush to pull out their DAT recorders and 16 MM cameras to record the supernatural smack more of the filmmakers planting props for the characters to film in higher grade video. The positives: the film is funny, the charactrs seem like real people (ultimately this is a bad thing, once they get into the scenes in the woods they start to break character and 'act'; it's supposed to symbolize psychological breakdown but comes off as unconvincing). The negatives: Blair Witch is only brought up once the arguments start to get old, the movie is way too cyclical; they go to sleep something weird happens, they bitch at each other during the day. The whole situation with the map; I won't spoil it for people who want to see it, but how they forgive Mike for this is beyond stupid, it seems like their reconciliation is more a product of bad writing than a need to band together for survival. Guy to keep an eye on: Josh - this guy has a future in acting, just pick better projects in the future, he has a cool look and seems like a credible actor. Heather, Mike - stick to indies, or better yet stay in school. If you want to see a better movie with the same pseudo documentary gimmick this film uses go rent Rugero Deodato's 1979 film Cannibal Holocaust, much more disturbing. Eerily enough, right next to the Nuart is a video store and in the window right next to the line for Blair Witch they had Cannibal Holocaust hanging in the display case, so obviously someone else noticed the resemblance as well."
"Spleen","1","1","4","19 May 2000"," Dull incompetence wrapped up in false advertising
","It's either a documentary or a work of fiction.  If it's a documentary it's a fraudulent one.  (It's not even a clever fraud.  I wouldn't have thought that such grotesquely inept camera-jiggling could have fooled anyone; but apparently it did.)  If it's a documentary then it's none of MY business to condemn it - I should simply report the scam to the police, the broadcasting tribunal, etc. and hope that someone will have the nerve to prosecute.<br/><br/>Taken as a work of fiction `The Blair Witch Project' is possibly the most wretched that has ever come to my attention.  I'm serious.  I can think of works of fiction that are worse in some positive way - books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, for instance - and I can't be expected to keep every single forgettable old book or television show lodged in my memory - still, I know of no other work so thoroughly lacklustre.  We don't even get the bare minimum of competent camera work we demand as a matter of course in other lame, incompetent endeavours.  The camera wobbles stupidly and does NOTHING else.  It doesn't even give us information.  The characters TELL us everything that's going on, in their long-winded way; they then offer us the camera footage as a kind of proof that they're not lying.  What's true of the images is true of the sound, too.  Heather and crew hear some `scary' noises at night; but do WE get a chance to listen to them properly, to decide for ourselves if they're scary or not?  Nope: instead we get an earfull of everyone panicking and DESCRIBING the sounds that I'm surprised they can still hear over the gabble of their own voices.<br/><br/>How could something so bad as `The Blair Witch Project' turn a profit?  How could it show, not just a profit, but the greatest return on investment of any film in history; how could it, despite all the people who walked out of the cinema or wished that they had, produce a few testimonials from people who said that they were duly scared - even that they LIKED it?  I think I have an answer.  The film disguised itself as a documentary.  The dullest footage of the most banal murder has its attractions, provided it's genuine. Fictional murders have to work, so to speak, to be interesting: real murders automatically are.  A simple lie can transform eighty minutes of utter rubbish into box office gold.<br/><br/>But you wouldn't want to tell an open lie too blatantly or too consistently. The law still has SOME teeth.  A better tactic is to persuade people to pretend - not imagine, but PRETEND - that they're watching a documentary. If we can't really believe that this is a documentary, they'd like us to come as close to really believing as possible.  Fiction is all about `suspending disbelief', right?<br/><br/>Well, no, it isn't.  A good work of fiction can frighten us, thrill us, fill us with aching longing and/or keen interest, etc. without asking us to be so feeble-witted as to suspend disbelief.  `The Blair Witch Project' can't.<br/><br/>P.S.:  Some say we should be merciful because the film only cost $30 000 to make.  But what does this have to do with us?  It's not as if they reduced admission prices in consequence."

","Don't believe the hype. The Blair Witch Project was clever, I have to give it that, but there were just entirely too many cinematic screw-ups for me to give it anything more than a 6.  The filmmakers were so caught up in making this seem like authentic footage they went so far as to disregard the importance of decent sound...I might have been creeped out if I could actually make out some of the dialogue and the actors weren't hyperventilating over each other's lines.<br/><br/>And what was up with that ending?

","I was one of the thousands sucked into the hype about this film.  I read everything I could get my hands on about it, and made sure to check the official website every Friday for updates.  I think the problem with this was that I knew more about the movie than actually was in it.  On July 16th when it opened up in Cambridge, I was practically camped out outside.  As I sat and watched, I found myself checking my watch and looking around the darkened theatre during what seemed like too many uninteresting moments.  I left a little- no a lot- disappointed.  But after the conversations it started with my friends and the nightmare it gave me that night, I decided I'd have to go one more time and make sure I went with a more opened mind.  EUREKA!  It worked, and I love this film!  I guess you would say it took some getting used to.  I only wonder why everyone's giving it rave reviews and not a single one of those cynical critics has given it a bad review (hmmmm...)."

","I saw the film when it opened this past weekend.  I was so excited for several days before I saw it because I had heard that it was the scariest movie ever made.  Well, I went to the film with five others and none of us thought it was scary.  Much of the audience was laughing during many parts of it.  I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read everything about it on the Internet before I saw it. We rented the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" afterwards and thought that it was much scarier than ""Blair Witch"". I thought the movie was good just because of the way it was made but it was not really scary at all.  The last scene was what I had hoped the whole movie would be like but then it ended."
"gldkey","4","1","4","19 July 1999"," An interesting novelty, but hardly the exercise in terror it's purported to be.
","I, like countless others, have waited with bated breath for this film to be released.  At last, a true horror film, one that will follow me home. <br/><br/>Alas, this is not that film.<br/><br/>It is an accomplishment, in that same way that other ultra-low-budget VISA-financed films are an accomplishment.  It is also an accomplishment in the way it was filmed, as the epitamy of cinema verite.  But it is not a good horror film.<br/><br/>Structurally, far too much screen time is spent establishing that the team is lost; how they get lost, how they get more lost, how they stay lost, and how they bemoan the fact that they are lost.  The vast majority of the film's running time is spent establishing this simple fact.  Only the remainder is dedicated to the nocturnal haunting and hunting of the group. This is a serious miscalculation (one likely borne of the filmmaker's methodology - one has to wonder how much night footage was usable, and how willing they expected an audience to be to stare at a blank screen in a too brightly lit theatre), a miscalculation that has the net effect of mutating the film into something more akin to a '70s-era ABC Movie of the Week than the future of horror.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from its failure to establish any of the three main characters as the skeptic, the audience's voice of reason, their proxy on-screen.  The skeptic is vital to the suspension of disbelief in a horror film.  The skeptic argues that it's nothing more than a lesion in the temporal lobe, and not Satan, that makes little Regan act so poorly.  The skeptic says Camp Crystal Lake is NOT haunted, that there's nothing to be found in the empty rooms of the Overlook Hotel, and there's no reason we shouldn't go to sleep tonight.  WE know the skeptic is wrong, because those are the rules, and we expect him or her to either die gloriously or receive their come-uppance in some other spectacular manner.  WE know the skeptic is wrong.  But we need the skeptic nevertheless.  Without the skeptic, we're asked to believe that three adults will be overcome with horror over the sight of a pile of stones in the woods, that they'll lapse into hysteria at the spectacle of some stick-people totems.  This is ludicrous.<br/><br/>Much, too, has been made of this film's ""unseen"" horrors.  True, a great number of the most nerve-jangling scenes in horror film history have been of the unseen:  remember the door to Regan's bedroom, a thin wooden barrier between us and the horrors beyond; remember 90% of Robert Wise's original ""The Haunting"".  These are clear examples of the horror of the unseen.  But they are horrifying not MERELY because they are unseen, but because we KNOW something is there.  Often, we think we've seen bits of it out of the corner of our eye.  There, in the carvings on the walls of Hill House - was that a face?  Or we can hear it - that nerve-shattering banging in the halls.  But there's always some clue we've been given to seed our fear.  And what does the Blair Witch give us?  Seven piles of rocks, then three piles of rocks, one bundle of sticks, and a partridge in a pear tree.  These are hardly harbingers of doom.  <br/><br/>And what do we hear?  Well, every night the deranged understudies of the Broadway musical STOMP will stop by your tent and beat out a rhythm on some rocks they have.  Please...if you want to hear the sounds of horror, play back the aforementioned sequence from The Haunting at high volume some night, or catch the first half of Wm. Peter Blatty's much-underrated ""Exorcist III"" for some real sounds from the devil's boombox.  By comparison, the rock clattering of the Blair Witch isn't even worth a witty analogy.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is an interesting novelty, and is deserving of a footnote in the annals of film history.  However, in the catacombs of horror movie history, it's merely an also-ran."

","This film is not the gripping thriller that it is hyped as.  I appreciate the unique method of filming, but the overall effect is not nearly as scary as the press has made it out to be.  If you want to be scared by a documentary type film, watch the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan.  I usually have the ability to suspend my disbelief, but in Blair Witch I found myself questioning what the three characters did at every step.  Why were they so damn noisy, why were their lights on all the time, etc.??? <br/><br/>
I expect that some people will be very scared by this movie, but it is not as groundbreaking as it is made out to be.  It suffers from the same old horror movie irrationality.<br/><br/>See it on Video to appreciate the different filming method, etc.<br/><br/>Gave it a 4"

","When going to see the Blair Witch Project, I expected to see an extremely good and scary movie.  I was forced to travel forty-five minutes to see the film at the only theater that was showing it in my area.  Furthermore, because the showings were selling out so quickly, we had to purchase tickets online for $9.50 each.  Keeping these aspects in mind, the film was not worth the effort one bit.  All that I kept hearing from the media was how truly scary it was.  It wasn't scary at all.  First, it was filmed on really shaky Hi-8mm video camera, which made nearly everyone in the theater motion-sick, then after nearly an hour into the film, almost nothing had happened.  This movie moved so slowly, and then the ending was abrupt, not scary, and lame.  This film is not worth the effort, and doesn't come close to the hype."
"WillPowerATL","3","1","4","18 July 1999"," An Interesting experiment, but failed in some aspects...
","Perhaps it was the buildup that killed this movie for me. Since I work in the entertainment industry, I have many friends who have already been to see screenings of this film in various cities, and although reviews were mixed, there were actually several who defined it as ""the scariest movie I have ever seen.""  When I went, I tried to keep my expectations low, so I wouldn't be disappointed, but it didn't work.<br/><br/>This film just didn't scare me. I was impressed with the concept, and the improvisation of the three young actors was, at times, more original and heart-felt than most of the acting I have seen lately in big-budget films. But despite this supernova of creativity, BWP never became more than an interesting experiment for me.  The gaping holes and inconsistencies in the story made me think about things too much, and some of the improvisation and events were obviously ""goal-oriented,"" and were too contrived to effectively mesh with the rest of the film's naturalistic methods.  In all, there were many times where I had to say, ""No way, someone in this situation wouldn't do that!"" or even ""What is that supposed to be? I don't get it.""<br/><br/>Although I am glad I saw the movie, apparently I didn't share the same experience most of my fellow moviegoers did. It seemed to me like I had just sat through a two-hour campfire story, but one told by a novice storyteller. I found myself picking at the inconsistencies, and feeling let down.  After several hours of buildup, I left the theater unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Again, I seem to be the only one that thought this.  Most of my friends LOVED the film.  Of course, most of them are idiots, so don't take their advice.  See it on the matinee to really get your money's worth."

Being a HUGE horror fan I couldn't wait to see this due to the huge buzz about how scary and creative it was.<br/><br/>But I've got to say this movie let me down a lot. The few scary scenes are hardly unsettling or truly scary, although there is a *slight* creep out factor in them.<br/><br/>Since most of the movie does not attempt to be scary, there are a few good laughs in it. Actually the comic parts of it are better at being funny than the scary parts are at being scary.<br/><br/>**ALSO** Some people are going to see this movie under the impression that it is real footage that was found ...or that it was a shot by shot remake of real footage that was found...Which is not true! But under this impression I could see how the movie would seem a lot better than it does to those who know it was all made up.<br/><br/>ALL IN ALL  I give it 1  1/2  stars  or 2  out of four.

Yes, there were a few creepy moments and nice build up at the end, but is there anything truly scary about this film?  No.  I honestly cannot fathom why people are calling this the scariest movie in history.  Most of the film was watching these people walk through the woods.  There was a chance for them to build psychological terror of being lost in the woods, but that was put on the back burner in favor showing night time events where nothing materializes.  I was highly disappointed in what I saw as false advertising for this film."
"Headshot","2","1","4","17 July 1999"," Not As Original As It Sounds
","Despite all the hype leading up to this film, I can't help but look forward to it.  Having been a producer of lots of low-budget television fare, and having worked on a LOT of public access shows, it always tickles me when someone manages to make something special on this kind of budget.<br/><br/>Now, I haven't seen the film yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  My biggest gripe about the film so far, hype aside, is all the claims of this film not being like anything ever seen before.  This film was actually beaten to the punch by a remarkably similar, though less frightening film called, ""The Last Broadcast.""<br/><br/>""Broadcast"" was originally shown in theaters nationwide in limited release in October, 1998...nearly a full year before ""Blair Witch"".  ""Broadcast"", too, dealt with amateur filmmakers working on a project in the woods who disappeared under ""mysterious"" circumstances, and was also shot on video as opposed to film.<br/><br/>Where ""Blair Witch"" is a terrifying, horror mock-documentary, ""Broadcast's"" mock-documentary did not focus on mysterious sounds or shadows in the woods - it was more of an intriguing ""whodunnit"".  The fact that they are extremely similar may be due to simple fate and circumstance, but the fact remains that these two very similar films are separated by nearly a year, with ""Broadcast"" getting first blood.<br/><br/>Which film is better?  I've seen ""Broadcast"", but the jury will still be out on ""Blair Witch"" until it comes out in wide release.  See both films for yourself, and you decide.  Until then, I'll keep waiting...and watching the shadows in the woods."
"HBOMB","4","1","4","17 July 1999"," The Emperor's New Movie
","With great anticipation I went this film, having heard so much buzz from critics, Internet postings and such.  My oh my.  Rarely has there been so much ado about nothing.  I'm not going to outline the plot because you know it by now but here's a couple of thoughts: exactly who was the audience for this ""documentary"" that was being shot? It's filmed with all the technique of Uncle Jim's video of Timmy's birthday party.  There's not even the slightest pretense of trying to make it look somewhat professional with interesting compositions, framings.  The footage was UNWATCHABLE.  I couldn't imagine watching their video for ten minutes much less a half hour to an hour.<br/><br/>Why must every banal moment be filmed?  What possible interest could their viewers have in watching the filmmakers shoot the breeze in the motel room or talk in the car?  It was unbelievable to see the amount of video that was used to capture moments that flat out did not belong in a supposedly serious documentary about the Blair Witch.<br/><br/>Here's the situation: You're in the middle of the woods at night in pitch black darkness.  You hear groanings and rumblings in the distance that scare the living hell out of you. The first thing you do is... a) grab a weapon or some means to protect yourself and wait<br/><br/>b} grab a flashlight to investigate or c) turn on your video camera even though it's far too dark to see anything. EXCUSE ME!!???<br/><br/>Ridiculous.  Absolutely ridiculous.  All of the above contributed to my never buying into the nonfiction reality the filmmakers tried to convey and as a result I wasn't scared or thrilled one tiny bit by this film.  It was a gimmick movie and the gimmick didn't work.  Its sole redeeming feature lie in its performers.  They were very effective.  But other than that, you can have this movie.<br/><br/>Most disturbing film since The Exorcist?  Puh-leeze."

My husband and I went (he likes good horror movies), and we were both left wondering what on earth all the hype was about.  Neither of us (nor the folks sitting next to us) were scared for one minute.  I honestly don't get all the buzz around this film -- it's just three college students running around with hand-held cameras, getting scared by piles of rocks and stick figures.  The noises that were supposedly scaring them out of their wits at night couldn't even be heard clearly in our theater.  And Heather really got on my nerves -- during the interviews in the beginning, she kept interrupting the people she was interviewing or otherwise interjecting comments, which was annoying.  And -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I've never read a lost-in-the- woods-survival book in my life -- but can't you follow a stream and usually find civilization?!  To those who are saying that anyone who doesn't like this film has to have huge special effects to enjoy a horror movie, think again -- I did watch a few of Hitchcock's masterpieces and was scared out of my wits, with almost zero special effects.

"paulo20","3","1","4","11 August 1999"," A Tale of Three Idiots or Why TBWP doesn't work...
","...at least for me. [WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br/><br/>First, to be fair, I thought the three actors (Heather, Josh and Mike playing Heather, Josh and Mike) did well with what they had to work with (i.e. next to nothing); I honestly think they did the best they could. Yeah, they were grating with their constant bitching and cussing and whining, but they had to make up this s**t as they went along (and they only got $1000 bucks each), so I can't really find fault there.  I also thought that the film did well in building up suspense... ...unfortunately, that's part of the reason the film doesn't work, because it doesn't pay off.  I kept something really terrifying, but the film just didn't deliver.  But more on that later...<br/><br/>The first and foremost reason why BWP doesn't work is that three students CONTINUED TO FILM TILL THE END.  I mean, this should tip off anyone who might have thought this was real that it was,in fact,not real; at all.  It shatters even the illusion of reality, and the characters' attempts to explain their continued filming don't hold water for me.  No rational person would film running scared in the night or alleged bits of Josh or while fearing they are lost.<br/><br/>Which brings up the next reason why BWP fails: how could they possibly get lost in the first place?  Like they themselves said, the woods aren't that big.  They just walk in a straight line and eventually they'll get out. Yet they manage to walk around in circles.  Does the film explain this?  Not at all.  We can only vaguely infer (and it's a long shot) that the ""witch"" is making them lose directions.  But there's never any strong indication of this, unless those stick figures and rock piles are supposed to mean something.  Plus they had that compass!  Are we supposed to guess that maybe the witch threw their compass off?  That seems, to me, to be a heck of a lot to ask from the viewers.  So, anyway, the trio come round full circle to find that they've come upon the same log they'd already crossed over a creek(and they sure seem to cross a lot of them in this picture) in their southbound quest to get the heck out of the woods, which is in itself odd since you'd think they'd have recrossed it at some point and had some sense that they'd flipped directions.  But the main thing is why not follow that damn creek out of the stupid woods?  When Mike in a fit of semi-demented glee confesses he kicked that useless map (previously thought lost) into the creek, he unknowingly provided the clue to another ticket out of there. But, unfortunately, the three students are too unBELIEVABLY stupid to pick up on this (I have to believe that they are monumentally stupid, else I can't buy this at all).  But I willingly overlook this in the hopes of some big scary payoff at the end.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the third reason why The Blair Witch Project is nothing more than a house of cards.  That payoff never comes.  It just doesn't happen.  What we get is a shot of Mike in the corner taking a leak, or at least it looks that way.  All that expectation I had building up got quickly deflated.  What's that about imagination?  I'm supposed to use my imagination?  Come up with my own vision of the witch?  Pfah, any schmoe can do that.  Let's see, she's supposed to be this hairy ghost woman whose feet never touch the ground and in the middle of the night, she snags Josh in the middle of the night.  Ooohh scary... but... what if it's not a witch.  I most certainly did NOT see a witch.  Not so much as one nose-wart.  Did you see a witch?  Then how the heck do you or I know it's a damned witch? What if it's aliens, who stake out the place, to observe the locals and notice three idiots stumbling about in the woods and decide to kidnap them for study or their own amusement.  Hey!  Maybe it was those aliens who screwed with their compass and made the poor fools lose their way.  Stupid?  Damn straight!  But the filmmakers have left such gaping holes for the audience (the AUDIENCE!) to fill that I or anyone else can come up with some crazy BS to fill in those huge blanks.  And no one can tell me I'm wrong because there is nothing to say that's so.  NOTHING.  If witches, why not aliens? Why not faeries from the magical land of Narnia?  Hey, didn't you say to use my imagination?  And I could go on, but man would it ever get stupid, but as it stands I'm left unsatisfied with the movie's conclusion.<br/><br/>Some good examples of leaving the imagination to the viewer?  How about Jaws.  Steven Spielberg knew the power of not showing the shark.  We hardly see it, but we know it's there, because we've seen the damage it's done. Or take the Excorcist.  Sure we see that a little girl doing all those ghastly things.  But we never see the demon that possesses her, but we can only imagine what it would like if we could see it and it would no doubt scare the p**s out of us.  Because we have something solid, something strongly visual on which to base our fears.  That little packet that Heather found? What the hell was that?  Looked like it could have been teeth and possibly a tongue, but it also could have bits of porcelain and a chicken gizzard (and very well could have been).  It raises tension, but doesn't truly raise any hairs.  It tells me almost nothing.  It doesn't stack up against mangled corpses and little girls with heads that spin 360Â° .  What you can't see has to be balanced with something you can, and BWP simply doesn't provide enough.<br/><br/>One last word on the theory that what you don't see is scarier that what you do.  I'm reminded of a story I read somewhere:  Some guy enters a graveyard to rob a grave or something.  When he tries to leave, however, he finds something has grabbed his coat.  In a superstitious frenzy, thinking the resident of the grave he just robbed has snagged his coat, he struggles to get free, never bothering to turn around.  He ultimately dies of fright. Turns out what's snagged his coat is a sword stuck in the ground.<br/><br/>> Sometimes, that noise you hear in the night is some insect or bird, or maybe the wind flapping the shutters,10 or your cat screwing around in the basement.

Instead of feeling scared with the characters I was laughing (with most everyone else) at them.<br/><br/>And don't look for a satisfying ending.  Without giving it away, all I can say is that it is really the only ending that fits the style and story.

However, the amateur level of theatrics and ad-libbing take a major leap of imagination to overcome.  Michael Williams comes off best in the least showy role, with Heather Donohue and Joshua Leonard coming across as sophomore college drama students left too long to their own devices.  I understand it would be very difficult to develop any sense of plot and script when you leave it to the improvisational skills of untried talent, but perhaps a real script with improv touches would have resulted in a truly interesting horror flick.

","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a found footage movie that documents the missing three student filmmakers for disappearing into the woods near at Burkittsville, Maryland as they were shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch as it appears to be a legend. A year later their footage was found. Everyone hated this movie because its not about how shaky the camera was, but how they were extremely disappointed that the movie was not real; they all thought this was for real when they were stuffs about the three missing students, and most of all the Blair Witch that does exist in our world. I understand this movie is not real, but did it need to be? No. It does not need to be real because if it did, then it might as well ended up as a snuff film and that is not good. No one wants to see a movie that happens to be real, where they get lost into the woods and ended up being killed. That is completely stupid! I have never seen a snuff film, and I am not sure if I want to see one. I might as well not want to. I enjoy this movie for what it is! It may look like real footage, but it is not real. With that said, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the most effective horror movies ever made, and it is not only one of my favorite horror movies but it is my absolute favorite of the found footage genre. I do enjoy other found footage movies such as ""Cloverfield;"" ""Chronicle;"" ""Zero Day;"" and the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. The majority of the movie works so well to not include any music as it makes it very effective. However, it does appear at the film's end credits where it plays that strange creepy soundtrack that plays with all of this creepy sound as you hear something unusual. Tony Cora did that music piece for the film's credits, I thought he did great job for creating something as what I said previously unusual. The three main actors Heather Donahue; Joshua Leonard; and Michael Williams all do a wonderful job for playing themselves in a fictional way as if they were filmmakers. When I watch this movie, I get a sense of feeling that I was actually with those three and did ending up with them for getting lost into the woods; it almost like virtual reality and you feel like that you are actually there. I give credit for both Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for writing a great story, and directing for what they had envision it; as well as editing it. To those that hate this movie, I suggest that you should give this movie another shot, and maybe understand the movie better for what it is; also, to those that may have not seen the movie, I say check it out because it feels like an experience. I highly recommend ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and I give it a 10 out of 10."

That's the only reason why anyone went to see this pile of steaming crap is they convinced us all it was real. This is a good example on how good marketing can make a bad movie a hit even when it doesn't deserve to be. I mean no wonder all those Blair Witch parodies came out so soon after the original, it deserved to be ridiculed, it was that bad. Nothing happens, 90 minutes or whatever the length is of nothing. By the half way point I was almost asleep. By the way, lame twist at the end also. There is no Blair Witch ghost, it's an escaped mental patient who murders them all. That's it.

","The Blair Witch Project starts with the revelation that three student filmmakers disappeared in October 1994 & that the footage they shot has been discovered & is presented here for our viewing pleasure... Two young student filmmakers Heather Donahue & Joshua Leonard pick their friend Mike Williams up & set off for Burkitsville, Maryland to investigate & film a documentary on a local legend known as the 'Blair Witch'. To get their documentary going they interview various residents of Burkitsville who tell the tale of the Blair Witch, with the interview footage in the can the three set off into the nearby woods to carry on their documentary & try to delve a little deeper into the legend. Unfortunately they soon become lost, tensions begin to boil as Heather has the map but doesn't seem able to read it properly & when they try to sleep at night they are awoke & attacked by something from within the woods. Their plight becomes desperate as they run low on food, morale, patience & are continually harassed by someone or something, someone or something evil...<br/><br/>Edited, written & directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez The Blair Witch Project was apparently shot in a mere 8 days, was made for about $22,000 & made back $240,500,000 which is a ratio of $10,931 made for every $1 spent which ain't too bad, is it? Persoanlly I like certain aspects of it but dislike others. The script tries to keep it as real as possible with natural dialogue (I'm not sure who counted but apparently The Blair Witch Project contains 133 'F*cks') & most of the film looks improvised which I think it was. Everything is kept to a minimum & nothing is really explained which gives it a genuine creepiness at times, in this case less is more. We know what the characters know, which is pretty much nothing when I think about it. It can drag a bit, has only three character's & it does go round in circles while the lack of any sort of explanation for anything did annoy me & then there is the bizarre ending which will either please or disappoint you. The main area where The Blair Witch Project stands out is the way it is filmed just like a documentary & the film could indeed be made up of scraps of footage haphazardly spliced together as it alternates between colour & black and white & the cinematography has a real amateur hand held jerkiness about it to add to the supposed authenticity & we get lots of pointless (but psychologically important for the whole documentary effect) shots of people's backs, the ground & the sky, the entire film is shot first-person with a hand held camera usually operated by Heather & frankly this approach can become tedious & annoying at times. For those looking for sleek cinematography, cool camera angles & fancy special effects The Blair Witch Project is not for you, for those looking for something a little bit different & original then you could do a lot worse although it's hard to tell what any one person's reaction will be to a film such as this. There is no blood or gore or sex, just lots of bad language so don't expect anything like that. I must admit there is a certain eerie atmosphere & creepiness about The Blair Witch Project especially the scenes where the three students are attacked in the dead of night & are unable to see anything. The acting is pretty good throughout by a young & unknown (at the time) cast. The Blair Witch Project is certainly different although I'm not quite sure why it turned out to be such the huge commercial success that it was, I can still remember when it came out over here it was everywhere & everyone I knew wanted to see it but most were ultimately disappointed when they did. Definitely worth a watch especially for horror fans & considering it probably turns up on TV all the time it shouldn't be too hard to get the opportunity to see it & you should give it a go if you have a spare 85 odd minutes."

","""The Blair Witch Project"" according to some critics is one of the scariest movies ever made. Obviously we are dealing with a very low scare threshhold here as the only thing scary about this film is the sensationalized hype around it. What we basically have is a pretencious student film that thinks that jiggling the camera around and getting disjointed shots of the ground is scary and original. One can see this sort of thing nightly on reruns of America's Funniest Videos. The so called actors are obvious graduates of the MTV Real World School of Acting who feel that attitude and screaming constitutes acting. One could discuss the script if there was one but all appears to be made up as it goes along. The result is really a monumental bore that proves that the Hollywood Hype Machine is still running smoothly. If you want scary ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" or reruns of ""The Munsters"" fit the bill better than this home movie."

","What happens when you send three student film makers into the woods to shoot a documentry about a witch?

Perhaps, they should have taken some outdoor survival classes, because these clowns would probably get lost in someone's backyard.  And guess what?  We get to watch them complain, moan, and groan almost the entire movie and it is supposed to be scary. During all this they are been stalked by an unseen force or something, which is probably just someone camping who is sick of hearing them yell, scream, and cuss each other out.  This force does scary things like shake the tent and make barely audible noises in the distance.  It also makes arts and crafts and displays them...Oh how scary!  Meanwhile, our ""woodsman"" keep walking around in circles like idiots instead of following the river which would have prevented them from going around in circles.  This movie could have been really good.  The beginning was alright where they interviewed those people and before they yelled at each other constantly, and the end was alright too.  The middle, though, did not have enough in it.  There should have been more hints at what might be out there.  You don't have to show it so everyone knows what it is, but perhaps give peeks at something in the darkness.  Hear noises that are a bit more distinct.  This movie had potential, but wasted to much time showing the three argue."

"MovieAddict2016","6","1","6","30 October 2003"," Interesting, but far from being very scary at all...
","Some of the best horror movies are those that imply rather than explode, hint at rather than expose. Fear is scarier than scariness itself--scary is just scary. Fear is fear. And fear induces all else that follows. Fear gets you on the edge of your seat; fear makes the hairs on your neck stand up. The scare comes afterwards.<br/><br/>The movie is false, but knowing that ruins the surprise of it all. Three amateur filmmakers--two guys and a girl (where's the pizza place?)--go into a Maryland wood, in hopes of uncovering the secret of the infamous Blair Witch, a legendary witch who is rumored to live in the woods. First they interview town folk and get their sworn testimonies. An old, apparently crazy woman insists that the Blair Witch appeared next to her in a lake once and was covered with beastly hair. (That sent chills up my spine.)<br/><br/>Then they embark into the woods, equipped with video cameras and recording everything. But soon they get lost--the map is pointless. They just keep going in circles. They walk around the woods for days, every night hearing strange sounds outside their tents and finding mysterious wooden ornaments hanging in a graveyard.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch"" project is smart enough to know this, but that is about all I can credit the film for. It's that type of fear-inducing, thought-provoking horror movie not made since the likes of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen,"" but when I was done watching it I realized that it hadn't really scared me at all. It had me thinking, yes, and it had me interested throughout, but it didn't scare me. After all the fear had settled there was no scare left. I viewed the film with all the lights in the room turned off, and yet it still didn't scare me. In fact, I found it to be rather ridiculous at times.<br/><br/>But it is an admirable horror film, one that uses ancient techniques as opposed to chainsaw-wielding villains with ski masks chasing groups of very, very stupid, mentally under-developed big-breasted teenage bimbos around a house for hours in the dark, jumping out at the camera whenever we've gone too long without a jolt. No, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is all about insinuations and the unknown. I'll admit that the film is pretty darn creepy, if ineffectively scary. At one point, a group of three teenagers are asleep inside a tent, lost outdoors in a Maryland woods, when loud screams start coming from somewhere out there.<br/><br/>They rush outside with the video cameras jolting about frantically. I was waiting any second for some ghostly pale figure to be seen far off in the woods. <br/><br/>Which is part of my disappointment in the film. To unexpectedly catch a glimpse of something--the witch, the ghost of the murderer, anyone and/or anything--would have been terrific. To expose something ever so briefly so that you think, What was that? and try to play back your videotape again to pause the image. <br/><br/>But the film doesn't ever really approach the Blair Witch. Furthermore, it never really explains anything by the end of the film. And I understand that this is the appeal of the film for most people. BUT...I'm not asking to show the Blair Witch chasing them around. All I would have liked to see was at least an ever-so-brief glimpse of some unintelligible being. That would have been far spookier, because eventually you get to the point while watching the film when you realize it isn't going to show you anything, and you start to lose interest. <br/><br/>This movie sent chills up my spine and made the hairs on my neck stand up at certain points. This is my kind of horror movie--I'm not into the slasher flicks, primarily because I do not find them very scary at all. I'd rather have the images of the attacker lurking in the dark left up to me, not jumping forward at the screen. <br/><br/>Am I contradicting myself? I say I do not want to see the Blair Witch, but yet moments later I say I do. No, what I want to see is some effervescent being illuminated in the dark ever so briefly; it would be the ultimate spine-tingler. Remember in ""Signs"" how M. Night Shyamalan showed the alien walking across the driveway at a birthday party? Remember how you weren't expecting it, how sudden it was? How quick? I would have liked something like that--just something very quick and very, very spooky. Not even as detailed as the alien--some far away being standing in the middle of the woods, who suddenly disappears with a shriek. (So that you never really see it at all, you just see the light and think, What was that?)<br/><br/>The craving of seeing the attacker is part of the fun. In this case, my craving was never fully satisfied.<br/><br/>4/5."

Adolf Hitler was more vague about calling for the murder of all those beside the Anglo-Saxon white Protestant male. Maybe you feel comfortable endorsing a film where the death of all non-Christians is called for, but when a film like this gets a ringing endorsement in a country like America, I feel chills of fear going through my body.<br/><br/>This is to say nothing of the fact that I could have made this film in my back yard for a dollar. Maybe people mistake the grinding, painful feeling associated with extreme boredom for suspense, but I am not fooled. Eighty minutes of waiting for some tangent of a plot that can be reported to a publisher does not equal suspense for me. It equals annoyance, boredom, and anger that such an absolute piece of trash can get such major recommendations. Here I am, struggling to make a career in writing, and the bozos who made this pile of garbage are on a gravy train from strapping a camera to the head of a dying seal. The only reason I haven't sued my previous editor for aggravated assault is because he warned me that this film was nothing but Nazi propaganda, and that he wanted me to report on this film so that a semblance of balance could be injected into the media.<br/><br/>Honestly, I am not bashing this film because of tall-poppy syndrome or any other such phenonemon. I am bashing it because I value my life, my liberty, and my ability to pursue happiness, and the fact that so many people have something vaguely positive to say about this film makes me fear for all three of those things. Since this film hit the shelves, other pieces of normalist propaganda like Wonderland have hit the shelves, too. Has anyone who praises this film as a masterwork actually gone to a real Wiccan and asked their opinion of this film? I thought we all had it bad when pieces of garbage like The Craft hit the shelves. If you really value the religious freedom granted us by the First Amendment of the US Constitution that little, then by all means, keep praising this film as a miracle of independent cinema.<br/><br/>All in all, I am giving this film a score of zero. It is not over my head, it is not something we misunderstand, it is a piece of Nazi propaganda masquerading as an independent production, pure and simple. Those of us who have understood the message in pro-liberterian cinema like the mini-series called V should all express disgust that this load of bollocks even got the green light, leave alone a sequel.

Indeed, during one of the asinine speeches given by Heather, another member of the audience jumped up and screamed ""sieg heil"" in disgust. This comment got more applause and positive reaction than the film ever did. Indeed, by the time this appalling film was over, one patron near me was heard to remark ""you've got to be [expletive deleted] joking!"". This was the most positive comment I have heard about the film from a flesh-and-blood human to date. Indeed, when Heather is bawling her little eyes out for the camera in one of the film's last shots, another patron was heard to yell ""don't tell us your problems, Nazi bitch"".

Unlike this film, however, what I will be showing in my film project actually happened in Medieval Europe, Colonial America, and numerous other Christian blights on history - many times over. Indeed, the only reason why the makers of this film haven't been sued for slander is because the Christian menace still controls the political system of America.<br/><br/>It's a sad state of affairs when slanderous propaganda like this gets financial backing and then hailed as a classic by pond scum who don't know any better."

The whole thing is so obviously staged that you'd have to *really* want to believe it to believe it. The film has no actual scares... just a bunch of sequences that might seem scary if you believe them, which requires you to be very naive. What could have been a decent enough attempt at a semi-scary documentary is ruined by it containing scenes that there is no possible reason that any sane person would film(if it were real), including arguments, fights and various pointless conversations. The worst thing about this film is that there are actually people who believe it. People who think that this film was a true documentary, and that everything on the film happened. I can't believe that there are people who are actually that naive and superstitious, that they'll accept something so blatantly obvious fake as real. I mean, I don't have anything against people who believe in ghosts and witches, not at all, don't believe any of it myself, but I wouldn't entirely write it off as rubbish if someone was trying to convince me it does exist; but to go from believing in it, to grabbing something so obviously fake and try to pass it off as evidence in these phenomenons... I mean, had they actually documented something real, something that actually happened, that can't be scientifically explained, then I would say that the movie actually accomplished something. But it doesn't. It just preys on naive, superstitious people. No one, and I do mean no one, in their right mind could possibly accept any part of this rubbish as real.

Honestly, I think it's because they weren't there. They didn't experience it like those of my age. Like many people I believed this film was real. The way it was marketed gave it a sort of realism that no movie had ever done or has done sense. No one can capture the sort of realism that Blair Witch did. The creators took good care of their story, created an entire lore, bigger than the film itself and gives it a life of its own. There is and probably never will be a film like this. It's disturbing, it's creepy, and it stays with you, especially those of us who were there when it all began."

"david_rudy_lee","9","0","2","9 April 2019"," Terrifying Look at What Could Happen
","This is a film that I still remember the first time that I saw it. My father rented it and as a family we all saw it. At the time of viewing it, I don't even know if I had the internet yet. It was so believable, my sister for years thought this really happened. The synopsis is three film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind.<br/><br/>To get back into what I really liked about this film the first time is the realism. This isn't the first found-footage film, but it definitely helped revitalize the genre. It really does feel like a documentary. It is even better than the three leads all use their real names as their characters. The director and narrator of it is Heather Donahue. She worked with Joshua Leonard previously and he reached out to Michael Williams to do sound for it.<br/><br/>They get to Burkittsville and interview people in the town. One very interesting one is of Mary Brown (Patricia DeCou), an eccentric old woman. She claims to have seen a hairy woman whose feet didn't touch the ground. There is also a couple of the people who talk about a local legend of a child murderer named Rustin Parr.<br/><br/>The trio head into the woods looking first for Coffin Rock and then an old cemetery. Tensions start to run high when Mike doesn't believe that Heather knows where she is taking them and that she has gotten them lost in the woods. Noises at night outside of their tent make it even worse as they descend into frustration and terror.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, I did think this really happened for some time. Now that I know the truth behind the film, I have to say that the filmmakers did a great job at their campaign. They decided that they wanted everyone to believe that this film was real, even though it is fictional. This is genius to me, especially since they had such a low budget. If not for that, I don't believe this film would do as well as it did.<br/><br/>It is a premise though that we can connect with. The scary thing is that even today, with all of the technology we have, something like this could happen. We definitely could get lost in some of the woods in the country and never be found again. This film really is light on the supernatural, which makes those moments even scarier. I have to say, the scenes at night in the pitch black really get my tension going. The real life horror of exhaustion, lack of food and maybe never getting out is there as well.<br/><br/>The pacing and editing of this film is interesting. The realism is there and it does just feel like three college students trying to themselves out of the mess they are in. The basic story is simple and the footage is edited in a way where it feels like they would record for stretches and that is what we get. The longer they are lost, the more the tension builds. It can come from the interactions between characters as tempers flare and also from what happens at night. The film is actually written well as there are callbacks to things from earlier in the film, which I'm a sucker for. The ending is bleak and simple, but very effect.<br/><br/>I'm not sure this film would be as strong if not for the acting of the trio. Donahue, Leonard and Williams are really just playing themselves, but from what I've read, some of what they were doing wasn't really acting. They did stay out in the woods and writers/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez really messed with them to get the most visceral reactions they could. It is kind of messed to hear, but it did make for a much better product. The interviewees were all great as well. There is such an amateur feel which helps with the realism.<br/><br/>There weren't really any effects in the film, but it didn't need them. I have read they wanted to actually have a witch. I'm glad this is something that didn't happen, especially with the budget they had. The little Tiki-men like figures were creepy. The setting is what really makes it and the old house as well.<br/><br/>Last thing to really cover would be the soundtrack. The film doesn't have anything that is not ambient. I'm glad they didn't use music, as that really would have broken the realism. The use of sounds while being in the foods was great. That is what drives quite a bit of the fear, especially at night. Something I noticed this time is that at the end, all of the sound is coming from the non-film camera. I bring this up because it is unnerving watching Heather's footage while she is upstairs. This was definitely used strategically.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film is interesting. In the grand scheme of things, not happens. I can see that being an issue for some people. I think what makes it great is that they stick to the realism and it truly feels like a documentary. The true horror comes from being lost, exhaustion and being hungry. What happens to them at night really makes it even worse and build the tension. The acting seems real and even though there aren't a lot of effects, what we get is solid. The soundtrack of the film was used strategically as well. If you've never seen it, give it a viewing. I think this is a really good film and definitely helped spark the found-footage boom that happened again."

"TheMovieDoctorful","10","0","2","2 March 2019"," ""You gonna write us a happy ending, Heather?""
","I mentioned in my review of Mandy how some films transcend the boundaries of mere entertainment to become a true experience. The Blair Witch Project is one of those films. It never fails to re-capture the distant feeling of being a child growing up on the American East Coast during Halloween, when one could feel the aura of the supernatural in the air. When one had reason to be afraid to venture off into the woods. It's a film that grabs me by the head, looks me in the eye and says ""Yes. There is still some black magic left in this world."" No Horror movie has ever left me feeling more vulnerable or small than The Blair Witch Project has and it never fails to weave its frightening spell to this day. This is still the only film to ever give me nightmares.<br/><br/>The dark allure of The Blair Witch Project begins long before film students Heather, Josh and Mike begin shooting in the demonic Black Hills Woods. Even the casual interviews with friendly town folk have an ominous tone to them. There is an unspoken but widely acknowledged truth to the legend of the Blair Witch and the legacy of Rustin Parr that you can feel from their testimonies; something wicked is afoot in the Black Hills Woods, (""I don't go up there! I believe enough not to go up there!"") but acknowledging that such an evil entity could live in their midst would mean facing their own insignificance and helplessness to its whims. The only one willing to fully accept the terrible truth is the village idiot, Mary Brown. The crew's misunderstanding of town resident's vague responses as being full on denial of the occult evil that haunts Burkittsville will ultimately spell their doom.<br/><br/>It says a lot about the performances of these actors that they deceived an entire country into believing they had watched a snuff film. Heather Donahue perfectly embodies the strength, confidence and absent minded genius of her on-screen counterpart. Her enthusiasm and passion for filmmaking are inspiring, even as we watch her ambition, the shadow of her arrogance, become her ultimate undoing. Her screams of horror and cries of hysteria are some of the most chilling and convincing in film history. Joshua Leonard very easily could have just been the annoying stoner type, but his subtle, heightened aggression and descent into madness over the course of the film really helps to benefit the tension that Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are trying to build with this trio. Mike Williams is deeply sympathetic as perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable member of the team, retaining a sense of innocence and naivety compared to his crew members that constantly had me rooting for him. And Lilith almighty, what a convincing screamer.<br/><br/>For a found footage film, the visual direction in The Blair Witch Project is among the best I've ever witnessed. The woods are shot in a way that we never quite get a feel for just how far they span; they could go on from anywhere between 5 and 500 miles. All we have to shape our judgment are the sky and the endless expanse of dying, decaying trees. The 16mm camera and Hi8 camcorder give the film a disturbingly personal and nostalgic feel. The horrifying events that befall the trio of film students could easily be home video tapes of relatives or friends. Because of this, footage like countless stick figures being hung in the trees miles deep into the woods feels far more real, and the off-putting, unnatural and macabre tone of it hits a lot harder. Forget ""putting yourself in the characters shoes"", The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most interactive Horror movie ever made in terms of generating empathy from its audience through use of visual aesthetic. Shattering of the fourth wall is standard for the found footage genre, but no film has ever done it quite so effectively as this one.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest aspect of the film is its sound design. Much has been made of the film's focus on what you can't see, so a higher quality of sound design was not just important, but critical, for making The Blair Witch Project work. The sound design in The Blair Witch Project is equal parts unforgettable and nightmarish. From the all-encompassing marching of the Witch around camp to Josh's distant screams. Of course, the ""laughing children"" scene is by far the film's most terrifying and memorable use of sound to create terror, the sheer unnatural and almost perverted nature of it leaving me in an absolute frozen, chilled-to-the bone sense of fear with my mouth agape in shock every time I watch it. The slow buildup from a vague, undefined noise to clear, undeniable laughing is done absolutely wonderful, my mind (And the mind of the characters) becoming less and less capable of chalking things up to merely one's imagination. It's a haunting reminder of all the children whom the Witch has claimed, a kick in the teeth to the film's characters (And the audience, to an extent) of the dark and twisted power of legends and the reality of pure, supernatural and deadly evil. A reminder to the film students that their fate is to be nothing more than another footnote in the Blair Witch's legacy, yet another story to be told around campfires to keep the memory of the Blair Witch alive.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a journey, a seductive nightmare that never fails to captivate, enthrall and horrify me. Not only is it possibly one of the scariest films of all time, it is a massive achievement in film-making in general. A Halloween must watch that never fails to bring in emotions and feelings inside me I thought long dead, The Blair Witch Project is a bone chilling fever dream that speaks directly to my inner child and mortifies him to his core."
"GiraffeDoor","8","0","2","24 February 2019"," It doesn't just coast on its gimmick and is worth a try.
","I was born too late to get swept away with the hype and the particular way this movie was marketed. Before seeing this movie I was sure it would be terrible. I'm not against found-footage on principle, but everything I read made this movie sound like it would be trash, especially the positive reviews.<br/><br/>I thought that it would just coast on its gimmick and marketing and do nothing but shake the camera and scream. Saying directly to the camera ""I'm so scared!"" isn't exactly following ""show don't tell"".<br/><br/>Maybe it's because of this that I was pleasantly surprised. I usually hate improvised stuff, it's insulting to the audience. But here they pull it off just right. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and believable but they edit so that it never gets dull.<br/><br/>The pacing is impeccable too. We move smoothly from the amateur documentary to frustrating situation to a bit of a nightmare. And irritating comments like ""this is creepy"" notwithstanding, as a slow burn, it is really effective.<br/><br/>We don't get any of the other things that annoy me in horror. It never gets soapy, there are no cheap scares, there is no filler.<br/><br/>I basically knew how the whole thing ends, not the exact end, just the gist of it, and I was still clutching Teddy when things really kick off.<br/><br/>This is a polarizing movie for understandable reasons.

","Blair Witch Project is about 3 people, Heather, Josh and Mike, documenting on the ""Blair Witch"" a tale well known by the town of Burkittsville. This film was the start of the Found Footage Horror movie genre. They use the found footage technique to try to make the movie more real and in this movie it is used very effectively. Once they first see the weird rock piles I was at the edge of my seat. This in my opinion is horror, it captures the fear of getting lost and knowing that something is watching you at all times. The scariest part of the movie is not knowing what is out there. You never see what is scaring them, you only hear noises and see the characters reactions and it adds more realism to the movie. But the last 5-10 minutes of the movie are terrifying. Once the words ""There's a house"" were said, stuff was gonna go down. Throughout the movie Josh goes missing and Heather and Mike start to go looking for him. They start hearing his voice from an abandoned house and they decide to enter, at night. Mike heads to the bottom floor and finds Josh getting killed by something (off camera) and his camera cuts off. Then it switches to Heather's camera and she heads downstairs. She then sees Mike facing the corner of the room not moving at all. Then Heather's camera is knocked over facing the floor and it ends. The reason Mike was facing the wall was that before they headed into the woods, they were talking to some town locals about the ""Blair Witch"" and one of the people said that the when someone sees the witch killing someone, they get put in a corner facing away and then after they get killed. That's what happened to Mike. He saw Josh getting killed so he got put in a corner. And Heather then saw Mike getting killed and so on. I don't think this movie is one of the best or one or over hyped. The camera quality hasn't dated that well in today's time and the films that came after this kind of make you disrespect this movie a little bit. It's really fun horror movie that is fun to watch with a group of friends."

","I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very suspenseful and I liked that if was filmed so simply. It was first person and you really felt what the characters were feeling. The way he camera moved made you feel more a connection to the film and it almost felt like you were there with them. In my opinion this film was a suspense film. I don't consider it a horror movie because you never see any thing gory or demons or monsters. At the beginning of the movie a man explains how the Blair Witch kills people; she takes two people into the basement. She makes one person face the wall while she kills the other one and then she kills the next one. She didn't like to feel there eyes on her as she killed. When Heather walked into the basement she was knocked down and the camera was focused on Kevin standing in the corner. This suggests that Mike was being killed or had been killed and Mike was next. Presumably Heather would have had to have stood in the corner next and would have been killed after Josh was killed. This movie was one of my explains movies filmed in this style. I liked the way it made you feel connected to the characters and it made it more real and intense. After the filming ends I assume that Heather and Kevin would be killed. I'm very happy I watched this movie and hope to see the second on soon."

","It might surprise some of you to hear that this was my FIRST TIME seeing The Blair Witch Project. I know, I know. I used to have a problem with movies (or TV shows, or books, or anything else) being TOO POPULAR. When something would come out and everyone was freaking out and raving over it, I would tend to roll my eyes and go the other way. I was only 12 when The Blair Witch Project showed up in theaters, but I remember everyone going nuts for it and that meant I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. I have since (mostly) gotten over that problem — honestly, it stopped me from getting into a lot of cool things — but for some reason I just never got around to seeing this movie.<br/><br/>When this movie first came out in 1999, it blew all expectations out of the water. Shot in 8 days on a $60,000 budget, it went on to gross $248 million in theaters, placing it as the 5th highest earning independent film ever made. The director, Eduardo Sánchez, had set up a website prior to the movie's release to convince interested watchers that it was, in fact, genuine found footage. At its Sundance release, flyers were passed out encouraging anyone with information about the missing three to come forward. The star of the movie, Heather Donahue — whose eyes are burned forever in everyone's minds from that iconic scene — still has people telling her that they thought she was dead. Her mother received sympathy cards after the movie was released. That alone — the whole concept of a hugely viral website combined with a very widely believed myth — is fascinating. It's part of the reason I love found footage style movies so much — the ability to skirt that line between fact and fiction.<br/><br/>The basic story is simple: three 20-something film students head into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland, to make a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch, the ghost of Elly Kedward who was supposedly banished from Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1875. Things quickly start to go very wrong and we watch them run for their lives through the woods until the tragic ending.<br/><br/>It has some pretty natural interactions and dialogue, most likely credited to the fact that much of it was ad-libbed throughout the filming process. The three actors didn't know each other before filming but got to spend some pretty intimate days together out in the actual woods of Maryland. Honestly, the bickering between the three of them gets a little old at times, and particularly the two guys' quickness to berate and insult the director, Heather, for what they perceive as her shortcomings (losing the map, not knowing exactly where in the woods they are, etc).<br/><br/>Overall, its strength comes from, as I mentioned, its ability to make you, at times, unsure if what you're watching is real or fake. It really makes me wish I HAD seen it in theaters, because I, of course, now know that is was not a real documentary but a huge number of people believed it when it was released, and it would have added a whole ton of suspense and tension to the watching experience if I truly hadn't been sure.<br/><br/>But it still has that believable quality from the found footage style, and the fact that we never actually see the thing that we most fear. We have the isolation of being not only deep in the woods but lost AND without a means of outside communication. The breaking down of morale in the group. The mounting evidence that SOMEONE — or someTHING — is following closely behind as they move through the forest. The scene where Heather makes her emotional confession into the camera is brilliant in the sense that it drives home this feeling of desperation, of helplessness. You are on edge for much of the movie because you're simply looking into the darkness to see what's out there.<br/><br/>It wasn't the most interesting movie I'd ever seen, and again, not as impressive as I imagine it might have been closer to its release, but credit where credit is due it's a masterfully done movie both in marketing and execution."

The movie is filmed with hand-held cameras operated by three film students purported to have disappeared in the Maryland woods with only this footage to surface sometime later. Even though their fates are sealed viewers may fear the plight of the two young men and a woman who become lost rather fast and then are slowly driven insane by a stalking presence that visits them in the night and leaves horrifying gifts outside their tent.<br/><br/>Heather Donahue plays herself as the lead documentarian. She convinces Josh Leonard and Michael C. Wiliams to venture out into the woods after interviewing the locals and hearing all sorts of terrifying stories. Heather insists for some time that they are not lost though both Michael and Josh know they are. On the second night out in the woods all sorts of terrible sounds can be heard but the team can't capture any of it on film.<br/><br/>The horrors grow and the rough shaky angles of the camera only add to the confusion and terror. The dread increases to dramatic as the characters all grow more frustrated and turn on each other. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez know how to draw out the dread and only give viewers a glimpse of the strange occurrences, but a glimpse is all that is needed to generate the fear to make this movie a smashing success.

I understand that it was supposed to be some type of found footage of some sort and as though they all disappeared and some hikers found this tape and decided to edit it and put it out to the public, but it was trying too hard to focus on them being themselves that there was no type of acting ability within it at all. This movie was only given a 5/10 solely because it was the first of its kind. Yet, everything else about this film, was not as good as everyone had claimed it to be. In my opinion, if you would like to see where all of the present day 'documentary style footage' originated, I would watch this film just to get some history down packed. But, if you're watching this movie just to watch a movie, I wouldn't recommend this one. Unless you're up for a supposed ""scary"" movie with horrible acting."

","Arriving in a small Maryland town, a group of students shooting a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch head out to the woods where a series of events forces them to believe the urban legend is true and try to leave the woods alive.<br/><br/>There wasn't much, but this one here did have a few good moments. One of the better elements here is the fact that the woods themselves look incredibly intimidating and freaky which goes a long way towards making them feel much more mysterious and imposing than normally expected. There's a really well-done attempt to make it seem like there's a real presence just beyond the eye-range, and it makes the terror and suspense of the scenes that much more powerful. Among the better sequences is when they come upon the Wiccan ceremonial site which is creepy, disturbing and a little unnerving, and it stands up as one of the best scenes in the film. There's also the fantastic scene where they come upon a specific site in the forest after leaving it behind earlier and their disbelief at it is really accomplished well. The film's best accomplishment is that it really makes it seem like a supernatural force is behind it all, and this is mostly done with just noises, yells or screams that indicate something is amiss and it just seems all the more realistic that something is causing it even without showing the actual witch here. When the small artifacts turn up or the camping equipment goes missing during the night, it just makes it far more creepy and realistic. While its' slam-bang ending ends the film in the right manner, there's quite a few flaws to it that manage to hold it down. The main one is the seemingly aggravating and annoying camera-work throughout here, as the entire purpose is ruined with the shaking-camera gimmick. Granted, it's supposed to be through their lenses as they're out in the woods and is handled well in that regard, but you still want to be able to see exactly what you're shooting. There's no way it should've featured the scenes of them running through the woods still shooting, since the shaking camera makes it nearly impossible to see what's being attempted, and there's really nothing in there that needed to be seen, making it quite confusing why that was being attempted. It's practically impossible to do so in some of the film's scenes in here, especially the second campground attack as it looks exactly like it's being shot through the wrong lens and is out-of-focus since there's no way it has to look as terrible as it does there, and a later shot of them wandering around in the woods is ruined due to the glare from the Sun in the background, and for a couple seconds it really looks like the entire scene has a tarp thrown over the area, darkening it to an unimaginable degree. The last big flaw is that this one has one of the most boring and dull set-ups ever. The early scenes of them filming their set-up for the shoot itself is just packed with nonsensical scenes that really could've been explored in a prologue introduction where they come upon research giving the same answers rather than the bland interviews here that don't move the film along any faster. The last half of the film is barely any better in that the constant yelling and screaming at each other is just impossible to sit through. It's not character-building, it's just aggravating to the audience to have to sit through them yelling and curse at each other for five minutes about moves that don't even matter at all, and each time it becomes harder to get through. Beyond these issues, there's not a whole lot to like here.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language and Mild Violence."

","I've finally got round to watching this 15+ years since first hearing about it. In that time I've seen the excellent REC 1&2 & Paranormal Activity series, among a few more mediocre found-footage efforts.<br/><br/>Blair Witch had me intrigued during the first 30 minutes, and on-edge for the last 50. I was enjoying the build-up, getting all tensed up expecting a shocking ending but the final scenes were tame...and then the film ended suddenly, somehow not satisfying that craving for shock - that's what watching this film 15 years after the hype will do for you.<br/><br/>You still get solid believable acting accurately conveying the rising fear of being lost in the woods (for those of you also with experience of wild camping). And it offers an interesting mythology, with one memorably-chilling scene involving kids' voices and tent-abuse.<br/><br/>I never felt bored, but my partner did. So if you haven't seen it and enjoy the found-footage films I mentioned earlier then it's still recommended, just prepare yourself for a more subtle, less graphic experience (even less graphic than the minimalist Paranormal Activity 1)."
"AgentOfTerror","9","0","1","16 April 2015"," Exactly what I hoped it would be, and much more than I expected!
","I've known of this movie for the past 16 years, yet only got around to watching it today. Having seen the trailer, known the plot and read the reviews, I admit that the reason I avoided this film for so long was due to my incredibly low expectations of it, both as a horror film, and as a film in general.<br/><br/>Yet I was drawn into the story within the first 30 minutes and couldn't look away until it was over.<br/><br/>While I can understand the generally negative reviews of this movie, I strongly believe that in order to fully appreciate this film, one only need use a bit of imagination. This isn't an artistic film, this isn't philosophical and this isn't about character development. This film is purely mindless entertainment that delivers quite well as a horror film if one is willing to imagine that these events truly occurred.<br/><br/>The film plays on a lot of essential horror elements that give the viewer the unsettling feeling of fear and uneasiness, while delivering these in a realistic manner. You won't get some CGI scares or a guy running around in costume, there is no eerie soundtrack. The feeling of fear that this film provides is entirely based on what is happening to the three film students.<br/><br/>Indeed, a certain sense of dread creeps up on the viewer from the very moment the group leave the car by the road. Perhaps this is because the viewer is told that the students will not survive from the very start of the movie.<br/><br/>To me, the most unnerving and frightening element in this film was the feeling of hopelessness that the group share upon realizing that they are truly lost. This, coupled with the strange occurrences, definitely makes for a terrifying experience as the film goes on. The subtleties in the supernatural elements keep this movie from becoming another overdone horror film in which a certain climax is reached; we never see the witch. The group can never really know that the strange events are anything truly supernatural. We never see anything to indicate that a witch exists (though the careful viewer may notice that all the events do make sense when remembering the stories from the start of the film.)<br/><br/>Although the characters lack a certain feel of realism and depth, and I felt that this film did have room for improvement in certain areas, these were minor drawbacks and they did not for a moment take me out of the experience. As stated earlier, this movie was about one thing: horror.<br/><br/>I feel that this film did an amazing job in entrancing the audience on a low budget. It stayed authentic from beginning to end and left room for speculation as to any possible meanings at the end. Personally, I enjoy a film that requires one to think about its meaning rather than just laying it all out for the viewer.<br/><br/>As a fan of both classic and modern horror made on a budget, I found this film to be exactly what I hoped it would be, and much more than I expected. I already know that this movie will stick with me for a long time."
"CCFilmFan","8","0","5","15 March 2015"," I finally forced myself to watch this, and I'm glad I did.
","Let me first say that I almost always hate the 'found footage' type of horror film because, let's face it, you're fooling no one. It's just a cheap and easy method to add some scare to the audience by attempting to make them believe that what they're watching actually happened and, although unlikely, could potentially happen to them.<br/><br/>But TBWP was different, although it's a clearly fictional plot, I got really into it. The acting that's been criticised as 'amateurish' for me, made the movie. You're meant to believe that this trio are making their own documentary, so their acting is going to be that of amateurs and, for me, Donahue Leonard and Williams all did a fantastic job of portraying this to the audience. With the addition of the hand-held camera style of shooting, it all comes together to really make you feel like you're in the woods with them.<br/><br/>The storyline is a great idea and very original, but I can see why others hate it. If by watching a horror movie you're looking to jump out of your seat or see something gruesome then no, this isn't for you. But the spikes of suspense created in this film makes you really on edge and even though you know from the start what happens to the three characters, you're more and more anxious as to how it all happens as the film goes on.<br/><br/>A definite must-see for any horror movie lover, 8/10."

","No other film made in my lifetime has stirred so much hullabaloo as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Granted, I was only ten years old when the film was released, but I remember its almost immediate absorption into the cultural lexicon; my fifth grade classmates told me stories about it, and how it was real, and how their teenage siblings had let them watch it with them when mom and dad went to bed. <br/><br/>Thanks to an expansive marketing campaign that touted the film as ""real footage,"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" fascinated and tantalized audiences in 1999. Despite the fact that the film is entirely fabricated, and that everybody knows it, it doesn't change the fact that it captures an unusual realism that enables it to get under our skin in spite of all presupposition.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: three college documentarians go into the woods to investigate the legend of a witch who has been said to be the source of various goings-on in a rural Maryland hamlet over the past century. What starts out as a hunky-dory camping trip slowly edges into a downward spiral of dread as the three find themselves helplessly lost and apparently hunted.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, few films made in my lifetime have stirred up such a hullabaloo as ""Blair Witch,"" and I think few films have also been so polarizing. While it is a true ""love it or hate it"" film, and oh, are there haters, there still is no arguing that it's incredibly unique. Looking backwards over fifteen years later, the film has spawned an army of found-footage imitators that are still, for the most part, unimpressively smearing their way across cinema screens well into the twenty-first century. Few, if any, are even remotely as unsettling, and most of them are disastrous. <br/><br/>The greatest thing about the film is that it dodges horror tropes in favor of character dynamic and vague suggestiveness. The filmmakers and actors portraying the characters ease potentialities into our heads from early on, interviewing locals about the folklore, relaying stories about purported murders and personal experiences that have been attributed to the witch; playing up the hype of the urban legend. What we don't realize as an audience, is that we very subtly become immersed in the allure and intrigue ourselves— and thus, by the time the characters find themselves at the mercy of nature and experiencing bumps-outside-the-tent-in-the-night, our psyches are impulsively running wild with the evocative power of the folklore that we have been provided. The possibilities of the nightmare here are endless, and that is the true power this film wields, even years later, and even when we know the truth. 9/10."

","This movie is the perfect model of an independent film and of horror movies in general. According to IMDb, this movie had a budget somewhere around $60,000 and made $140,539,099 over its lifetime according to Box Office Mojo. So, if you judge the success of a movie based on the money it made, The Blair Witch Project is a definite winner, but is it actually a good movie? <br/><br/>Well there must have been something bringing that 140 million dollars to the box office over its lifetime, and I believe that was its creativity and its realism. This movie is the inspiration Cloverfield and Chronicle, and all the other found footage style movies we have today. The acting and camera-work is so believable that, at the time of its release, many people believed it to be a true story! Honestly, the characters were relatable and often times said what I was thinking while watching it. <br/><br/>When you watch this movie, be sure to keep the volume up in order to really get immersed and hear all the creepy and disturbing noises the characters are hearing. This movie does horror right! I personally believe that jump scares are a cheap way to ""scare"" the audience and filling a movie with jump scares does not make it scary. In The Blair Witch Project, there are no jump scares, so be sure to keep the volume up and get wrapped up in the legitimately frightening story that it is."

","What genies horror filmmakers will tell you is that human beings are afraid of the unknown more than anything. A chilling and absolutely terrifying horror film titled ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a film that gets it. Writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez take the fear of the unknown and make one of the lowest budget films of all time and the single scariest film of all time. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is about three film students making a documentary about the legend of an evil witch in a forest near a small Maryland town. The three interview locals about the legend before entering the woods on a scary adventure they will never forget. The entire film is shot by one of the students named Heather. She is accompanied by Mike and Josh. The filming goes smooth until they get lost and are haunted by the witch at night. There are many aspects that make this film terrifying. The main factor is how it is filmed in a way that it looks like actual footage by these three people. Haxan Films did the brilliant job of marketing this film by making fake missing signs for Heather, Josh and Mike. The film looks and feels so real that you'll never go hiking again. The three encounter various noises in the woods, leaving us unclear on what they are. We never see what the three are afraid of. We don't know what we're going to expect. The names of the characters are the names of the actors. Many thought this was a true story, but the truth is it isn't. The actors are now going on to do more acting and even said this was just a story in interviews. That doesn't take away its fear factor. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is full of scares to haunt you forever. The acting by these three is so realistic and stressful. The entire time they are lost and frustrated that it starts to wail on you. The night scenes make you think if you were in their shoes, making it only more terrifying. Not a single blood spill is in this film. It's all horror that tricks with your head and you won't be able to get it out. It will scare you forever."
"kaitlinvalerius","3","0","1","26 May 2014"," Unexpected Expectations
","First off I'd like to say that I understood the film 100% and I don't need people claiming the opposite, because overall, there wasn't much to understand.<br/><br/>All I saw was a bunch of teenagers running around the woods throwing f-bombs at each other a mile a minute. The acting was excellent (not going to lie); though the storyline was mediocre. I was bored half to death during the entire course of the movie. To be honest, the only part which creeped me out was the discovery of all the voodoo figures. What made three helpless teens think it would be a dandy idea to venture off into the middle of the woods to search for a supernatural entity which could have been the cause of many disappearances over the past century is well beyond me. Another annoying aspect of the film was Heather's constant babbling and filming of every little nook and cranny of the woods to capture this so called witch instead of fleeing to safety. First, she gets the group lost - twice - with a map (although Mike ends up idiotically discarding the map later on). Second, the day after Josh mysteriously disappeared from camp, Heather wanders off as usual and finds his bloody remains tied up in his plaid shirt, which is then stuffed into a bundle of sticks and keeps the information to herself. Lastly, she is either really out of shape or she is really stupid. I'm going with the latter. The last scene of the films ends with Mike and Heather entering the house searching for Josh. As the two teens pace across the broken floorboards of the creepy house, we can clearly see little bloody hand prints scattered all over the walls. At this point I would figure out that Josh is dead and leave, but this is a movie so we must venture on! Mike suddenly hears screaming from the basement and sprints down the stairs to rescue his not so alive friend. Instead of chasing after him, Heather decided it'd be in her best interest to instead trot behind him at 2mph and continue to shout at the top of her lungs. The last clip the audience views is Mike seen facing the wall followed by Heather dropping her camera - although we don't see her because it cuts straight to the credits. Boom! The end.<br/><br/>What? That's it? I honestly don't understand why this particular film was hyped up so much. I was excited to watch this because of all the commotion surrounding the movie, however it did not live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>If I rate below a five, it means I personally think the movie/TV series was dreadful, which is the reason 3 stars out of 10 were chosen.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."

The movie builds up so much suspense for an entire hour, only to be shown nothing of the 'entity'. The only thing that relates to horror was the yelling and placement of witchcraft objects around their tents. This is yet another film that builds up an incredible amount of suspense for almost the whole movie but is just utter garbage when the movie come's to it's conclusion. The final scene is of one of the main protagonists staring at the ceiling. Really? You're going to build up so much suspense yet conclude your story with a man being retarded and staring at the wall.

","This is the film that inspired the 'home video' movies like Paranormal Activity and such, but unlike them, this is an original film. It doesn't follow the normal criteria of a horror film of any kind. Some argue that it goes back to older horror movies around the time period of Dracula and Frankenstein because it's not graphic or big on visuals, but it builds suspense throughout the whole film. If you like a typical horror movie, avoid this one. The main premise is consistent throughout as well, but there's no sign of a moving story, so again, it's based on your preference. Most of all, people seem to have strong opinions on how scary this movie is. If suspense and anticipation is what's scary for you, then you will have a great time.

","This is one of the most hyped movies of 1999 (along with Star Wars, which was more anticipated than this movie). One of the things that helped the movie a lot was the impressive webpage (which I will discuss later) and how it actually adds a lot of background to the movie itself.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is what is called a Mockumentary. That is a fake documentary. A number have been done in the past, and the best ones are those that the viewer is left wondering if it is true or not. Man Bites Dog was incredibly disturbing while This is Spinal Tap left a lot of people wondering who this group was and where they could buy their albums. In fact, Spinal Tap was formed as a direct result of this movie.<br/><br/>The plot to the Blair Witch Project is simple. Three film students go into the woods looking for the infamous Blair Witch and become lost. They are then killed by the Blair Witch. There are a couple of subtle things in the movie, such as the guy at the beginning talking about how a murderer lived in the hills and will force one of his victims to stand in the corner while he killed the other, simply because he could not kill when somebody was watching him.<br/><br/>This is said to be a horror movie and pretty scary. I didn't find it scary, but it was very well made. The you never see the antagonist (except when he or she is running away) and strikes is a very intelligent manner. He strikes only at night, and then kidnaps one of them, yet keeps him alive forcing them to not only come after him, but come after him at night. They are lost but he knows the territory exceptionally well. The movie itself is a little sickening because of the motion of the camera. All of it is done using hand held, and people have been made quite sick with it. Some claim that it is because of the horror, but I don't think so. <br/><br/>In regards to the horror, some have said that it is bad because it is not traditional horror. I am not at all concerned about that, especially since I hate traditional horror. I myself prefer thrillers to horror, and find movies like the Haunting and Nightmare on Elm Street to be very bad.<br/><br/>This I saw not because of the horror or witchcraft, but because of the nature of the film. It is, I believe, one of the first mockumentaries to hit it big time. In fact it has made over $25,000,000US, and even though there might be criticisms about it, this figure is hard to ignore.<br/><br/>Now to the webpage. It is designed to add to the background of the movie. I won't go into it much because you can go there yourself. What I will say is that it forms the background to the movie as putting it in the movie itself would add too much to it and destroy the feel to it. In fact, the movie is just as watchable by itself, but reading the background gives much more to it."

However, the authenticity of the project and its strong marketing strategies didn't hurt a bit. But it wasn't just a financial success, it was a critical one as well. How does ""The Blair Witch"" hold up today? It all depends on your fixation of fear. If you are prone to A.D.D. style of filmmaking with quick-cuts, generic jump scares, and gore galore, you'll absolutely hate this film with a passion and tell all your Facebook friends how awful this film is and how no one should see it. On the contrary, if an eerie atmosphere and a slight interest in mythology lures you in, this film should be a highlight in cinema, just as it was for many.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" is a film, dressed up as a documentary, shot with 16mm cameras which revolves around three friends wanting to shoot the doc. but simultaneously unravel the truth.

Just the tone it sets and what lies around in their surroundings is just so gruel and unnerving, I was at the edge of my seat for the entire running time. If you can setup a pitch-perfect mood like these guys can, your movie automatically reaches an accomplishment. But what makes ""Blair Witch"" have layers is its strong character development. Each and every character is easily relatable and their acting chops show. One mistake people make is that good acting should be the equivalent to likable characters. That's not always the case. If you have protagonists, maybe obnoxious ones at that, but can give one hell of a performance and fulfill their job as an actor, that is all that is required. <br/><br/>Now what ""Blair"" does to take that extra mile is that the movie is secondary. What a secondary horror film to me is is when it feels three dimensional, when you feel it is so real it's like you're in the movie. ""Blair"" is such an example and that's where the terror lurks. What makes ""Blair"" so scary? Its authenticity. The character setup, the tone, the direction. It's all there. If you're not one to appreciate such things, again, this movie isn't for you.<br/><br/>Is it scary? real? Doesn't matter, ""Blair Witch"" works.

","As a major fan of the horror genre I heard about The Blair Witch project and simply HAD to go and see it! Thinking of myself as a hardened horror buff I was pretty sure that I'd enjoy every second, and I did, but I was terrified! The fact that I was heavily pregnant and had to return home to an empty house as my husband was working away should have been a deterrent, but I thought I'd be fine!<br/><br/>My sister (who loathes horror movies with a passion) had seen Blair Witch the night before and said she was disappointed in it. She said it was over-hyped and simply not frightening. How wrong she was!<br/><br/>The film starts with 3 student film makers, Heather, Josh and Mike, heading to Burketsville to make a documentary about the legend of The Blair Witch. They visit various sites of interest, speak to local people and hear the story of Rustin Parr. Parr was a local man who kidnapped, tortured and murdered 7 local children in the 40's. During his trial Parr claimed that he was possessed by the spirit of Elly Kedward, a woman burnt as a witch in the town of Blair. Burketsville was formerly known as Blair.<br/><br/>The trio then head out into The Black Woods. They visit Coffin Rock, the site of the murder of 5 men. As the film progresses the students move further into the woods. Inevitably they become lost. <br/><br/>What follows still scares me to this day. As fear takes over the sensibilities of the trio they begin to fight and argue with each other. Then, when night falls, strange happenings occur. Children are heard laughing, strange objects are left outside the tents. The students slowly descend into absolute terror. <br/><br/>To go any further would mean including spoilers, which I always hate in a review. Needless to say the frustration of the students is passed on to the viewer. Shaky camera-work (this film being one of the first 'handheld camera' movies) only adds to the fear as we are unable to see what it is that is terrifying the students.<br/><br/>I watched this film on the edge of my seat. On my return home I was physically afraid to be alone. I actually ended up staying the night at my parent's house!

","The Blair Witch Project is an interesting mockumentary with an intriguing concept, that was the victim of many bad decisions, in the process of making it and especially of promoting it. The ambition, it seems, was to create an experimental art-house film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, and by marketing it as a 'horror' movie, create surprise and buzz. The attempt to bridge the gap between the two viewer groups was quite positive, but what it actually achieved is alienating both: the horror crowd was disappointed and annoyed, especially younger viewers who sneaked into an R rated movie expecting gore and heads-on horror; and the more sophisticated, avant garde crowd, turned off from day one by the film's promotion, didn't even bother to go see it.<br/><br/>A decade later, it's easier to put all that aside, as well as the internet-based hype generated by the producers at the time. The film can now be appraised as what it is, an exercise in experimental filmmaking, and an interesting one at that. It takes a lesson from the true great classics of horror - in that the fear of the unknown, the anxiety and anticipation of violence are much more effective than explicit violence in itself - and indeed, it's scarier than almost any horror movie created in the last twenty years, although the teenagers who usually go for that kind of movie will probably disagree. The Blair Witch Project creates tension and anxiety, and draws the viewer into the characters' world. And it doesn't matter one bit whether or not you think it might be real - in fact it's more impressive when you know that it's not.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it doesn't achieve true greatness in that respect either. In its attempt to bridge between mainstream horror and experimental indie movie-making, the film reaches a sort of middle ground that isn't quite here nor there, not quite satisfying anybody. The Blair Witch Project is not a classic or a great film, nor will it ever be, but it should be watched by fans of independent and experimental cinema and of classic horror, and remembered as a brave and innovative experiment that didn't quite make it."

","Spoilers properly fitted some early drafts of this review due to politics. It is not so relevant now.<br/><br/>I understand that this feature was released in 1999; a recently made story by a USA storyteller; using USA resources and personnel and locations.<br/><br/>I purchased my Blu-ray as I considered that it was likely to be able to be interpreted as a comment about UK politics of around 1999. I was not disappointed though it took me some musing to realise that I could see parallels that felt real.<br/><br/>It helped that I could wait until I found a lower than usual low cost second hand Blu-ray, for this I would not have wanted to pay typical second hand Blu-ray prices. Why pay that much if one is likely to get scared? <br/><br/>So, I was purchasing a Blu-ray of something that was mostly filmed in 8mm. Except that is not as pointless as I would have once thought.<br/><br/>An example of some detail that stood out for me: The team leader being the one with a map and compass, yet showing symptoms of giving outward indicators of using them properly and results that might come from trusting one's heart rather than what technical indicators say? So, very rarely there might be times when even social outcasts might benefit from that, but to quote Full House series: How rude of me to consider feminist warfare in such terms. Not many might agree with my opinion if I clearly say what it is based on.<br/><br/>I expect that this story is more likely to relate to USA politics of circa 1992 to 98 than UK 1999, but why that title for a USA story?"

","This movie scared the heck out of me. What surprises me is that people I know who are scared watching any horror film thought this movie was boring. I believe a wild imagination is necessary to truly get this film. What scared me about this movie is what my imagination was doing every step of the way. What was happening while they were sleeping? What was happening when they heard screaming of their friend when he went missing? What was making those banging noises and why? Because this film does not show anything horrific, it is up to the viewer to fill in the missing spaces and this is what frightened me. I am sure what was going on in my mind could not have been portrayed in a film and still received an ""R"" rating. The unknown and what could be happening is what made this film frightening. And the true horror in the eyes and voices of the filmmakers in this film more than reinforced my worst fears. Overall, this film did something that has not happened to me since I was about 10 years old. It made me afraid of the dark and of the strange noises in nature that we hear every day."
"larma7","9","0","4","10 July 2011"," Perhaps flawed, but still a masterpiece in horror and great filmmaking
","Think of a time where you are sitting alone in the late hours of the night, preferably in an old house. You sit there quietly in the silent darkness before you start to hear unexplained creeks around the house, rustling of the tress in the wind outside, and all of a sudden, without any reason whatsoever, the tension inside you starts to build up, your mind at times causing your imagination to run wild. There is indeed a distinct level of creepiness that can occur being isolated in the quiet hours of night, and this is even amplified when outside, something which the characters of the ground-breaking horror film ""The Blair Witch Project"" have to face. And you face this creepiness, among other forms of terror, with them as you experience the film. <br/><br/>Much has been made about the controversy of how people were literally duped into believing that these tapes were real footage, partially because the filmmakers apparently advertised it as being ""real."" It's also fairly understandable (although obviously unlikely under a critical light) to have possibly believed this because the production, despite the minuscule budget, is quite remarkable in how believable and convincing it is. Sure, the characters can be a bit obnoxious and heavy-handed at times, but the performances are very good. However, the main reason that the film works is that it takes a bit of an unconventional and refreshing approach in its attempt to scare its audience. ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't merely work on just realism to achieve its horror -- it is, in fact, most impressive in how it utilizes its setting to ultimate effect to create a subtly overbearing atmosphere that just continues to creep into the film.<br/><br/>Part of the setting's effectiveness is that I deeply identify with the actual setting. Living in the United States and on the Pennsylvania/Maryland boundary line, I am extremely familiar with the type of woods the characters traverse. In fact, anyone who has lived in rural, forrest areas or who perhaps has experienced camping in the woods can probably relate. Additionally, I love films set in the wilderness, especially ones which heavily emphasize their environment in order to tell the story. This film is a perfect example. The cold and desolate nature of the forests help supplement the feeling of dread within the film. People have criticized this film as boring and that nothing happens. Ironically, a lot of the intrigue I find in the film is when supposedly nothing (visually) is happening. Visually, the film at times reaches the level of being entrancing. The endless shots staring into the woods -- staring into the darkness. What is heard, but what isn't seen. The silences. Yes, according to traditional narrative standards, barring a few encounters and events along the way, little to nothing (on the surface) actually happens. It's a film which works in tremendous restraint in showing very little, and instead allowing the audiences' own imagination to do the scaring. It's not horror that works on gore or masked murderers. It doesn't even work on being afraid of ghosts or monsters or the supernatural. It's the tremendous feeling of isolation and vulnerability in the cold, desolate forest. The feeling of being alone and lost and stalked. <br/><br/>Consequently, because of the pseudo-documentary technique of telling the story (which some dismiss as being merely a gimmick), the film actually invites us to become more involved in the setting and immersed in the characters' immense frustration, panic, and terror in being lost, starving, and hunted. Not only is this despair felt psychologically within the conflict between the characters, but we also can share the characters' experiences just as they are. The film works on an interesting dynamic of putting the viewer as a central observer of the action, due to the filmmaking technique being used. Whenever the camera stares off into the distance, we stare with it. Whenever the characters become silent in order to listen, we listen with them. A brilliant sequence deep into the film has the characters stumble across these bizarre stick figures hanging from trees. On its own the images are quite eerie in the way they are photographed, but what makes the scene most disturbing is the characters' reaction to these stick figures. There isn't anything too inherently scary or disturbing about this scene if witnessed on its own. However, at this point of the film, the characters' and audience has already witnessed some creepy occurrences, and as an audience member you can connect with the feeling that the characters have of being lost and completely disoriented. So, furthermore, when the already growing insane characters' freak out over these relatively harmless stick figures, this allows the opportunity for the audience to become freaked out. After-all, sometimes there is nothing more unsettling then seeing other people freaked out. Here, the characters and audience feed off each other and experience things together. This is the ultimate goal of filmmaking, and it is achieved here so simply but at the same time so brilliantly. The scares are not created artificially, but come with context, and they are slowly built up through the setting, the atmosphere it creates, and the tension and emotions of the characters. The end result is at times intensely disturbing, exhausting, and mostly quite convincing."

","If you have a rich, vivid imagination and a fascination with the subject matter, I think you'll enjoy this. This movie was somewhat of a pre-reality era movie in that I don't remember any other cinema movie of this style being popular before, and certainly not hyped as having real footage. I do not understand how an adult or even a teenager could be naive enough to believe this footage was real, but I guess that added to the thrill for many.<br/><br/>Without question, not actually showing everything built suspense and mystery. The entire film would have collapsed like a house of cards if they had introduced a green skinned woman with a pointy hat at the end (LOL). Instead, we got a very cool ending. Along the way, you'll have to endure some overbearing acting by the female lead, but overall, this is worth watching at least once. You probably won't feel the need to watch it again after that for quite a long time, but it is an enjoyable experience nonetheless. It unfortunately typecast the actors (especially the female lead) forever as ""that guy/girl in Blair Witch"", but the men who made this film undoubtedly had no need to ever work again after this (budget $60,000 for a gross of $248 million, you do the math..). Definitely a one trick, one time pony, but an amusing one."

For the most part, yes. <br/><br/>What makes The Blair Witch Project effective is the great way that atmosphere and fear of the unknown are used, as well as how well the three actors sell their frustration, unease, and finally, terror. As the three amateur filmmakers get more and more lost in the woods, their anger and annoyance at one another and their situation does a great job of raising the tension. Add that to the local legends that they were exposed to before venturing out into the wilderness and the odd, disturbing events that start happening each night, and you've got a pretty creepy little film.<br/><br/>The key to enjoying movies like The Blair Witch Project is how easily you can suspend your sense of disbelief and just go with what you're seeing. If the movie can draw you in, you'll probably have a good time with it. I didn't have a hard time putting myself in the shoes of our trio, and I know that if I had been in their situation, I would have been well and properly freaked out.

"KUAlum26","7","0","2","8 September 2010"," Good movie,GREAT concept and promotional push
","Now somewhat expected in scary movies,around 1998 filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez made the daring and clever move of not only creating a singular camera,FX-free horror film with unknown actors(which may've as much been the end product of being relative first-timers of movie making as it would be credited to being ingenious,to be sure)but also going to work promoting the film as if it were a real occurrence,replete with its own website,its own history,documentation,and plenty(and I mean PLENTY)of interviews and fake newscasts. By the time of it's running,thru a number or film festivals and word-of-mouth promotions thru the early part of 1999,the movie was a virtual dynamo of anticipation when it finally landed in commercial theaters a week or two after the 4th of July that year.<br/><br/>For the most part,it feels like a lot of invention and inspiration for a movie that,while inspired and effective enough,seems to be really challenging the viewer to love it or hate it. When I first saw it eleven years ago,I was much more in the ""love it"" camp. Upon re-watching it in full more recently,I'd more put it in the ""solid like"" category.<br/><br/>Treated,at its broad-frame as a sort of ""Super documentary"",it portends to show the film of an attempted documentary of three film students from Baltimore(Heather Donahue,Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard--all using their real names and not seemingly attempting to show any distinction that would give them away as actors)who go on the trail of the rural legend of the Blair Witch,an 18th century woman who was cast into the woods of post-colonial Maryland,only to disappear and somehow,foist curse on the locals in neighboring towns. After roughly eight days of being lost in the woods somehow,the three understandably lose their cools,rationale and eventually much more as their uncanny knack to be tracked by someone(or something)in the woods has them unable to think clearly and,ultimately,escape.<br/><br/>Plenty of ""cinema verite"" and improvisation(supposedly,the directors made the actors merely react to situations by leaving index cards along the woods telling them of what was happening next)made this simultaneously one of the more organic and unnerving films made.My lessening of enchantment of this movie is mostly from the passage of time,a chance to digest all the elements of the film/story and the re-evaluation of camera and filming tactics,which,while appreciable for their lack of excess and attention to more intangible fear and atmosphere,seem to be challenging the viewer in ways that threaten to break the viewing experience as well as enhance it.<br/><br/>Extras on the DVD are a real plus:getting to see much of the back-story attached to this show is a largely satisfying element(and also gives me some insight into a couple of less-than-flattering reviews)to accompany a film that may seem a bit thin or ""naked"" on its own. An inspiration for ensuing ""shocker"" movies to come(Cloverfield,Quarantine,Paranormal Activity,The Last Exocrcism come to mind),this movie is worth a look,though the cleavage of opinion on it is gonna be quite difficult to overcome. Back then,a near ten;now,a weak seven. A keeper? You be the judge."

","By now I would think most people would know the story of the Blair Witch Project....But here is my take. This film has spawned several so called copies since its release in 1999. Examples would be, ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Paranormal Entity."" These films were in my opinion not as good as The Blair Witch, which was an original idea the time it was released. 3 young filmmakers, Jennifer, Mike and Josh go into the woods in Marlyland to shot a Documentary on the legend of the The Blair Witch. What happens is they come across an old cemetery and by accident knock over one of the grave stones. This lets loose the the Ghost of the witch. The three filmmakers then become lost and are haunted as they try to find their way out of the woods....ghostly sounds of children laughing and the sounds of footsteps around their tent terify them as they desperately try to find their way out. Despite all that is happening someone always seems to find time to film what is going on which leads to a lot of camera shake but this gives it realism and makes it truly scary.<br/><br/>It was said earlier in the film that the place the 3 were going to make the documentary was up in the hills around Burkittsville, Maryland. As the filmmakers got lost you see a river in several shots and you wonder since water flows to its lowest point why not just follow the river down till you are out? This never seems to dawn on the filmmakers. Of course that would have ended the film...in any case this is still very good...."
"Red-Barracuda","8","0","1","2 February 2010"," The first internet event movie
","The Blair Witch Project was an internet phenomenon back in 1999. It was in fact probably the first movie to show that the World Wide Web could be a powerful tool to promote a film. Moreover, the BWP also showed that you could achieve huge financial cinematic success on an absolutely minimal budget. Love it or loathe it, The Blair Witch Project was truly a unique cinematic happening.<br/><br/>The film was marketed on the internet, via cyber-rumours, as a possibly-maybe real life documentary. This not only heightened expectations but also built a myth around the film similar to the fictional Blair Witch legend in the film itself. But this expectation also led many people to be somewhat underwhelmed by the Spartan nature of the final product. Many thought it was a non-movie and were annoyed to have been suckered in. While others conversely appreciated the original feeling of unease that the ultra-low budget documentary-style approach brought. These highly contrasting reactions have made The Blair Witch Project perhaps the ultimate Marmite movie. It's unusual to be truly indifferent about this film.<br/><br/>It has to be said that I am one of the latter group who actually liked the BWP. I think that the gonzo-style film-making approach does actually add to the fright-factor. At times it's easy to put yourself in the position of these people and feel the tension and fear. The night-time scenes especially are frightening affairs, with the weird cackling and children's laughter very disturbing indeed. The fact that we can barely hear these sounds because of the muffled sound on the amateur equipment only adds to the authentic feel and, therefore, the discomfort. All of the terror in the woods in set up quite nicely with some talking head interviews at the outset of the movie where some aspects of the witch and her legacy are discussed. The information is as fragmented, contradictory and ambiguous as old legends tend to be but sometimes, as in the case of the story about the direct encounter with the witch, it's eerie and disturbing; it nicely sets the scene for the journey into the woods.<br/><br/>If I had criticisms of the film I guess one would be that it does seem ridiculous that none of the participants think to follow the river downstream, I mean surely that's gonna be better than randomly trekking through the woods? And secondly, I feel that maybe showing just a little more would not have harmed the film at all. Perhaps the briefest flash of the witch at the end in the house? Also, even though I realize this is seriously low-budget, I would've thought they could have come up with something a little better than small piles of rocks as the portent of an evil presence.<br/><br/>But all in all, I mostly appreciate this flick. Its unique brand of horror was a welcome alternative for the genre. It admittedly was not the first film to use a pseudo-documentary approach but it nevertheless still has the feel of something quite unlike anything that had gone before."
"John_Truby","Null","0","1","7 January 2010"," Using a low budget to your advantage
","The Blair Witch Project is a textbook example of how to write a successful script for the independent market. What appears to be sloppy film-making by amateurs is really just one element of a strategy that turns weaknesses into strengths.<br/><br/>What were the writers faced with as they approached this project? They had very little money and a lot of trees. That meant their script had to have few characters and would have to be shot on video. Most indie screenwriters tell their story and if money problems mean they have to shoot on video, that's too bad. The film looks video cheap and maybe the audience will overlook that and maybe it won't.<br/><br/>In a time-honored tradition, these writers decided to use the horror genre for their first film. But that created another problem. The average horror picture is highly stylized, with a number of precise story beats that are usually presented with gory special effects. But that takes money to do in a believable way.<br/><br/>And even if they had the money, these writers didn't want to do the standard Hollywood horror pic. All they'd end up with is a film that looks like all the others in a genre that doesn't have much respect.<br/><br/>But these two writers had an ace up their sleeve. They took their knowledge of the horror genre and figured out how to turn their production weakness into a story strength. Why not make the use of video part of the story? By making the main characters documentary filmmakers, the video look is not a constant reminder of what is missing, but seems totally appropriate for the characters and the situation.<br/><br/>More importantly, video makes this world very undramatic. The characters talk about the shoot, the equipment, the film-making process. The camera work is misframed. Not because these filmmakers couldn't frame correctly but because the ""wrong"" frame tells the audience these characters are real people in harsh physical and emotional surroundings.<br/><br/>By starting with an undramatic world, the contrast to the super-dramatic at the end of the film is more extreme and more believable. This isn't some obvious contrived Hollywood world. This is real kids getting lost in the woods and becoming desperate to find a way out as someone hunts them down.<br/><br/>This undramatic world, which dominates at least the first half of the film, would be story suicide for an audience used to fast starts and relentless attack were it not for another smart story technique. The writers use a framing device that tells the audience this is all found footage from three people who disappeared a year before. Again the writers make the video part of the story.<br/><br/>The main function of this framing device is to overcome the audience's impatience with the slow, non-dramatic opening. The writers are signaling a worthwhile endpoint, in effect saying to the audience, ""Go with us on the slow opening because we are going to give you the payoff you want later."" This use of anti-drama to increase drama is the same technique Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo use many times in the first Godfather film. For example, Clemenza takes a leak on the side of the road while a traitor is assassinated in the car. When it's over, Clemenza orders the killer to ""Leave the gun, take the cannoli."" Murder is part of this man's everyday world, and he doesn't think twice about it. That is far more horrifying than a hyper-realized mafia world which the audience can keep at a distance because it's nothing like the world they live in.<br/><br/>Similarly, in this world, horror is not something you see in a movie theater. It is part of these woods, part of three inexperienced kids getting lost in an indifferent nature, part of a two hundred year witch lore that may be silly superstition but may not.<br/><br/>Of course, none of these anti-dramatic techniques would work if the writers didn't have the dramatic story beats to play off of. That's where their knowledge of the horror genre pays off. Horror is one of the most precise of all genres, and virtually every beat of the classic horror story is found here. The writers also know the basic story structure elements that go into building conflict.<br/><br/>These horror and story structure beats aren't some formula that good writers avoid. They are the ingredients of a good story, the steps human beings take trying to solve a life problem.<br/><br/>Could there be more of these story elements in this film? Sure. For all the smart thinking that went into The Blair Witch Project, it is still missing a number of story techniques, especially in the area of plot. But a $30,000 budget is a severe limitation, as anyone who has tried to make a low-budget film will attest.<br/><br/>What can writers and directors learn from this film? First and foremost, learn the elements of structure and genre well enough that you can twist them in an original way. Second, if you want to make an independent film, figure out how to turn production weaknesses into story elements. Make the audience think you are shooting the picture this way because the story requires it.<br/><br/>Once again, it all comes down to story.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

","3 filmmakers head into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a legend that haunts the woods and murdered children.<br/><br/>Made almost 10 years ago, Daniel Myrick's picture is an unbelievable revolution into the horror genre. It was one of the first films to shoot completely digitally and showed 3 unknown actors the most terrifying part of their life by entering woods and told to improvise all of their work and create a revolutionary film, and they succeeded. Getting lost in the woods and unable to find your way out may sound conventional in this genre but this is so different from your average flick. <br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project feels real and therefore physiologically frightening. Shot with a shaky hand held camera and juxtaposed with all the method and improvised acting gives the film a highly soaked feeling of spontaneity, as if happening with you right there. You are sucked into the drastic turns of events as the trio encounter numerous difficulties and importantly for a horror film, this is open and appreciative of its target audience in regards to the legend, which will keep you hooked.<br/><br/>The opening shot shows added text stating that the footage of 3 filmmakers was found a year after their disappearance in the woods and therefore we ultimately think it to be true. What follows is the edited footage of their events including the build up before the woods and the heart stopping discoveries and events once inside. Simply stunning combination of real life and a depiction of a legend that will have you questioning everything once the film reaches its stunning climax.<br/><br/>At the time of my first watch I believed the story to be true and didn't even think to check the acting but looking back these are almost Oscar worthy. The feeling of hatred and undeniable concept of fear is there on every face. The rivalry and decisions reach high dramatic turns; none more so than Heather's close up confession to the camera.<br/><br/>Like the Shining this has a lot to offer with stunning direction and realism in context and performances Jack Nicholson would be proud of. Whereas not as sharp as Kubrick's masterpiece, you will certainly not think about anything else for the rest of the evening.<br/><br/>What perhaps is truly amazing that this was released the same year as The Matrix and American Beauty but this doesn't have star actors or special effects.

","Over the years, the horror genre has evolved into brainless, unimaginative movies revolving around the socially active lives of good-looking teenagers who drink, have sex and party all the time. Usually they consist of a female protagonist with a nice body who coincidentally loves to shower and walk around in nothing but their undergarments. The Blair Witch Project, however, is a breath of fresh air. The heroin, Heather, is a self-righteous smart ass who organizes to make a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. She and two guys, Josh and Mark, go hiking in the woods, and as expected, terrible things occur. The first while of the movie is easy-going and relaxing, watching them just being teenagers. Though once the terror really starts, it holds onto the audiences and introduced a sense of unease and desperation. Throughout the film, I felt like I was there with them. This has much to do with the effective documentary-style directing. Though not much is clear in view with the bouncy camera action, it leaves a great amount of mystery, and therefore more frightening to watch. The events and the character interaction is the real tension in the plot, not the blood and guts like a lot of horror movies. The emotion is very real, and through their distress you come to care about the characters and feel exactly what they're going through. And of course, it's freaking scary. When I get scared, I starting shedding tears. The night I watched this, tears were constantly running down my face. In all, I believe this is one of the better horror movies in the last decade."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","0","2","14 February 2009"," Among my favourite horror flicks but not for all tastes
","When ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released in 1999 it was a big hit and a breath of fresh air. It wasn't the first horror movie based on the supposed footage of ill-fated documentarians but mainstream audiences hadn't seen anything like it. The premise here is amply summed up by the film's tagline: 'In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found.'<br/><br/>The story is a good example of 'less is more' storytelling. True, the plot does involve a fair amount of aimless wandering through the woods but those scenes are crucial in the give and take of suspense where each night could be their last. There were a couple of instances when I thought that the script could have benefited from just a little less information (thus ratcheting up the mystery) but the film still shows plenty of restraint and, consequently, skillfully manipulates our fear of the unknown.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the cast of unknowns does a pretty good job of seeming like regular people rather than actors. There may be a few occasions whereby the emotions don't quite ring true but for the most part the actors are sufficiently convincing. They also perform double duty as cameramen, helping to enforce the film's sense of realism with mostly lo-fi visuals.<br/><br/>In the end, though, this is one of those films that most people will either love or hate. I think that it's definitely worthwhile but your mileage may vary. By the way, don't bother with the sequel; it's awful."
"tonymurphylee","Null","0","2","27 January 2009"," One of the most effective no-budget films ever
","The Blair Witch Project consists of footage that was found in the Maryland woods where three college students had disappeared back in 1994. The footage is what they saw. These 80 minutes are the last days of their lives. The footage is horrifying, chilling, disturbing, and haunting. We see these three kids have a lot of fun at first, but then things don't go exactly as planned. They lose their map, they get lost, and they find strange trinkets and symbols around their campsite. As they get more and more lost and the situation gets more and more hopeless, the situations start getting even more disturbing. They are attacked in the middle of the night, they scream, shove, and attack each other, and the sounds they hear in the middle of the night get even more disturbing and horrifying. The last twenty minutes of this film are some of the most hardcore scenes of horror I've seen in a modern horror film. It all leads up to an ending that contains one last creepy image that will likely be ingrained into your mind forever after you have watched the film. The Blair Witch Project is a film that uses atmosphere to create a foreboding sense of dread, suspense, and intensity. The film is scary, not because of what you see, but what you don't see. Most of the horrific scenes in the film are scary because of the power of suggestion and of fear of the unknown. We don't see monsters. We don't see what happens to these kids in the woods with our eyes. We do see what happens in our minds, and that's a lot more terrifying than anything that the film could show us. The fact that there's no logic to the horror adds a level of unease and makes the viewer feel not only completely scared but also helpless. That's how I felt when I watched the film. It is one of the weirdest and most disturbing low(VERY low) budget films I've seen."
"emuhlee15","5","0","1","6 January 2009"," Way too much hype, but, not too terrible.
","I watched The Blair Witch Project twice a couple years back, and hated absolutely every painful, boring second. I thought it was awful, the worst movie ever made. I stumbled across the reviews on here one day, and, as usual, was just amazed at how many people claimed this was ""the scariest movie ever"". But, before putting in my two cents, I decided to give the film one last try. I watched it yet a third time, and my thoughts upon viewing it this one last time made me give it a rating of 5 - much higher than I'd planned.<br/><br/>On some levels, The Blair Witch Project does work. There really are a few genuine moments where you sit back and think what-the-heck-is-going-on? Unfortunately, these moments are very few and far between, and interrupted by long sequences of painful boredom in which the three characters walk around and fight and talk about farting and kick maps into lakes and cause me, the viewer, painful boredom. And there are also a couple of moments of true hilarity, particularly the moment when Micheal tells his companions he kicked their map into the lake. I know that isn't supposed to be a comedic moment, but the acting is so bad that it comes across as just really, really funny.<br/><br/>The film has some strong sequences. One being Heather's apology speech - you know the one I'm talking about. This comes across as very genuine and real. And of course, the ending was kinda nifty.<br/><br/>So, all in all, The Blair Witch Project is worth a look. But it's definitely not the scariest movie ever. It doesn't even belong on a top-ten list or anything. But thanks to a few moments that stand out and are genuinely creepy, this film is saved from being totally a waste."
"diegoavilarodriguez","1","0","1","20 December 2008"," this movie needs a remake... BADLY!!!!
","OK, I have to be honest here, I saw this movie when I was 6 years old and later on watched it again to remember what was so bad about this movie... and now I remember why I hate this movie so much. First the bad things on this movie, this movie is so low budget that the whole documentary-like style of the camera had to obligatory cause they couldn't afford any camera men(though that style did change the world of movie making). Next, the plot, wow lost in the woods how original, that was seen in Friday the 13th so the whole lost in the woods things isn't so original, now the reason why they are lost in the woods was original but worst part of this film is the fact that it builds suspense for nothing(like the scene when they ran out of the tent, screaming and scared, suspenseful but not scary cause you don't even know what they running from.)For all I care it could be Bigfoot attacking them. Now the main thing people say about why this movie was so great was because they claim that the movie activates their ""imagination"", and I think that means that this movie leaves out so many unanswered questions that to them it's fun to fill in the blanks, of course not like the movie disappearance in which they leave out so many blanks it makes the movie awful, well that wasn't the case with the Blair witch project, but still even if it is fun to fill in the blanks with this film that is no excuse for the people who don't like to fill in the blanks, so to me it sounds like people like this movie because it basically wastes their time. And now we come to the center question of this film which is: Why did they not show the witch?! Now if they had shown the witch, I would just recommend you rent this movie but no, this movie is like a nightmare on elm street without Freddy Krueger, you wait around for something to happen, and when they finally come the ending the idiot chick drops the camera which honestly is a disappointment, you expect something creepy and all that, when nothing really happens at all, and really if a 6 year old doesn't get scared watching this film how can an entire nation get scared over some movie which is nothing more than a publicity stunt to gain quick cash. Alright, now though the whole movie was a waste of time there is the upside of the fact that this movie did have an original storyline and did have the potential to be a horror classic, but of course it was not a true horror classic, now this movie is like the Hulk which was a good idea pretty much screwed up so this film needs a remake seriously and it needs it right now."
"Prestige_Never_Pride","7","0","1","10 November 2008"," Very Eerie, But Not Quite a Classic
","This movie is overall very interesting. It would certainly fall into the horror genre, of course, but this is a different kind of horror movie. <br/><br/>The story follows several college kids into Maryland's Black Hills Forest as they try to make a documentary about a Maryland witchcraft legend. However, the students ""go missing"", and their film footage is found a year later. Not a bad story line. <br/><br/>The characters were very believable, considering that playing a movie like a true story isn't the easiest thing to do. The style of filming was, I think, what made the movie the most enjoyable. It was shot in the style of amateur-film-making, in that the quality was quite as sharp as ""real"" movies, and that the camera is bumped and shaken quite a bit. These factors made the story a little more believable, as horror movie plot lines are either believable or fake: there is no inbetween. I also love the absence of music throughout the movie, which added to the thrill. So, good characters, good concept, good style. That's what I can say about the movie that is positive.<br/><br/>Now, what I can say about the movie that isn't so positive is the story in general (not to be confused with the plot line). It was very hard to follow overall. Ideas and characteristics that should have been explained better were very vague, and things that should have been clear were confusing. It wasn't a STRAIGHT ride all the way through the movie (movies rarely are), but it throws you off track instead. Basically, the beginning was good and well-defined, the middle was confusing and vague. <br/><br/>The ending was about the best part of the movie. The instant the camera fell on that old, deserted, run-down house in the middle of the woods was definitely the high point. Then, it was an eerie, chilling roller- coaster ride to the very end, when Heather screams ""Josh!"", the camera falls to the ground, and all is silent. One really interesting thing about the plot is that you know the students died, but you don't know what killed them (yet it is, so people say, understood). It keeps viewers formulating their own ideas about what happened there, but it also leaves many very confused. <br/><br/>Overall, good movie, good characters, good concept, but not too good of a buildup. Nice try, though. I would say that this is a movie for fans of ""traditional"" horror, suspense movies, and the supernatural. Or, if you happen to be bored on Halloween afternoon and are waiting for the ""slaughter"" movies to begin. Overall, not a bad horror film.<br/><br/>7/10 bloody handprints. And if you happen to look at the house closely, there was a lot more than 10."
"KillerLord","8","0","1","10 October 2008"," Intelligently Done Movie That Gives You Decent Goosebumps!
","The movie ""Blair Witch Project"" is a remarkably well done movie. Now, I am slightly confused with my own statement here. Because, there is not much done in this movie. I shall elaborate on what I mean a bit later on. But let me briefly summarize that this movie is indeed a scary movie that does give you the scares and the goosebumps that one expects from a scary movie. But the beautiful part of this movie is that it does not give you typical ghosts, ghouls and monsters as found in this movie. It taps on the fact that you are more afraid of the unknown rather the known. And this is the greatest strength of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is about a collection of tapes. The movie starts out by stating that three kids had gone into a certain forest searching for what is simply known as the Blair Witch. They have never seen her but almost everybody has heard about her. The movie says that the kids were never found but their tapes were found and all we are shown in the movie is the tape recording of the adventure the kids went on. The movie does not have a cameraman. It is all recorded by the three kids who are the only major cast in this movie. Other people appear for only 2 or 3 minutes at the very beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>There is a certain rumor surrounding this movie that it is real. Many people believe that the tapes are authentic. I recommend you read the detailed and elaborate article on www.wikipedia.org which clearly explains the methods adopted by the producers of this movie to advertise this movie. The producers actually placed advertisements reporting the three lead actors as missing. This has led many people to believe and also spread the rumor that Blair Witch project is real. Well, it is not. <br/><br/>The movie's strength is that it shows you fear. The lead characters are scared of their experiences and fear shines on them. But if you have read about the movie in detail, you very well know that the fear on the characters' faces is genuine. They did go to the forest and instead of making them act, the director actually decided to scare them and thus the fear you see on their faces is genuine. So, for the genuine emotions of fear, frustration and tension you see on the characters, I'd prefer giving credit to the director. After all, he made the decision of making half of their experiences seem real to them. I don't know if it is a cruel way of making a movie but it works. The audience is scared and the movie is meant to do that. <br/><br/>The most scary thing about the movie to me was the stick figures they find in the forest. This really heightens the overall tension in the movie. The characters have lost their way in the forest and are doing the balancing act between consoling each other and also taking out their anger on each other. Each blames the other for their state of misery. We get to see genuine anger, frustration, fear and eventual terror in this movie. <br/><br/>A very ""well done"" movie indeed. Highly recommended for watching especially in the dark and preferably alone!"

Night clips of this movie are very horrifying, the strange voices from the woods were very horrifying and you will feel like you are there with them and facing all this. Horror from unknown is very terrifying and realistic kind off and not like other horror movies which has same line and same stories. I like the last scene of this movie which is shooted in a old creepy house.

"zardoz-13","6","0","3","4 September 2008"," Hype surrounds ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but the payoff is a rip-off!
","First, ""Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" qualified as a good sci-fi thriller but a galactic letdown as a prequel to the original ""Star Wars."" First-rate special effects engulfed a predictable, pretentious plot with characters whose charisma rating never scored as highly as the originals. ""Star War: Episode One"" wasn't the only movie with too much hype. The second movie that generated almost as much hype in an even shorter space of time was ""The Blair Witch Project."" Independently produced on a broomstick budget for $22-thousand dollars, ""Blair Witch"" aroused all sorts of curiosity. Was it based on fact or fiction? Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who co-produced, wrote, and directed this phenomenally successful horror melodrama, have changed the way that Hollywood publicizes movies. Moreover, they may have touched off a trend that will revolutionize movies as well as movie-making. In the short time that ""Blair Witch"" has haunted movie houses, this game little thriller has generated over $240 million dollars! ""The Blair Witch Project"" concerns three student filmmakers who vanished into the stick near Burkitsville, Maryland, in October 1994. A year after their mysterious disappearance, their film and video footage was discovered, and ""Blair Witch"" reveals what happened to this ill-fated trio. The concept and the production of ""Blair Witch"" should inspire anybody with a video or film camera that has movie-making ambitions. Myrick and Sanchez didn't let a paltry budget or the lack of major studio support encumber their efforts. Anybody who studies cinema can see the resemblance between this little movie and the Italian Neo-realism movement in the late 1940s after World War II. Like the Neo-realists, Myrick and Sanchez filmed ""Blair Witch"" on authentic locations with no-name performers so that they film boasts more than a shred of authenticity. The lack of a budget transforms ""Blair Witch"" and makes it such a promising premise. If Myrick and Sanchez haven't been compared with famous Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, who helmed the 1965 masterpiece ""The Battle of Algiers,"" they should be. The controversy raging over both movies is the superb way that the filmmakers give their subject matter an added boost by making it look like a documentary.<br/><br/>Sadly, all comparisons between Italian Neo-realism and Pontecorvo end when the lame storyline and the imbecilic characters in ""The Blair Witch Project"" are considered in retrospect. Media theorists will have a heyday writing about the symbolic implications of this movie for years, but dyed-in-the-wool horror fans will find ""Blair Witch"" less than satisfying. First, the storyline is predictable, lame, and improvised. Myrick and Sanchez get off to a bad start. ""Blair Witch"" takes too long, even for an 80-minute movie, to get itself cranked up. Of course, enthusiasts will argue that the filmmakers are setting up the characters and the situations.<br/><br/>Boo! These characters are as half-baked as their project. They plunge into the woods in their search for a spirited demon without any logistical support or back-up plan. Second, the characters themselves spend more time arguing than witch hunting. They aim their cameras at themselves more than at what they are searching for in the backwoods. They get themselves lost in the middle of nowhere and don't have enough sense to figure a way out. I'd have started a fire. These characters are every bit as stupid as the characters in major Hollywood epics, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" franchises.<br/><br/>Sure, ""The Blair Witch Project"" stirs up considerable atmosphere, but the payoff is a rip-off. The witch is only hinted at through symbolic settings and off-camera hysterics. The constantly shaking cameras may induce motion sickness for some, but there is nothing in this movie that would scare anybody over age four. Indeed, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has subtlety working for it, but subtlety will only get a horror movie so far before you want to scream: Show me the Evil! The acting is not an issue, any more than the funky looking, pseudo-16mm format that gives ""Blair Witch"" a novel appearance. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have produced an interesting but deeply flawed movie that will be talked about for years. Hopefully, ""The Blair Witch Project"" will inspire a new generation of low-budget, independent filmmakers. Presumably, next time Myrick and Sanchez will contrive a story that matches their cinematic gifts."

Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams gave it their all.<br/><br/>Neal Fredericks, who shot the movie, deliberately did the shaky-cam thing. Again, for many, it worked.

"deathscythe_42","8","0","1","22 July 2008"," Subtle but Chilling
","This film, in my opinion, was not ""Scary as Hell"" as it said on the box. Instead, it was very subtle with the scares, yet creepy and suspenseful, and has you thinking (along with the characters) ""what the hell is going on?"" The film builds fairly slowly, but it's interesting. They set up the plot-line with some back story/myths about the blair witch, enough that you can figure out what's happening later on in the movie when you think back on it.<br/><br/>The actors, I felt, gave very good and believable performances, as tensions built up throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie culminates in a climax that is not terrifying, but is suspenseful and creepy, and leaves you with an overall movie experience that I would consider to be chilling.<br/><br/>This is not a movie that you will watch and say ""That was so scary!"" It is, rather, a movie that you might say ""that wasn't that scary"" upon finishing it, but you won't want to think about for very long after you turn out the lights and attempt to go to sleep. It is easy to watch but sets a very creepy mood and may make you wonder what's really outside your tent next time you go camping.<br/><br/>Overall I thought it was a pretty good movie. On one hand they could have made it a little scarier but on the other, had they made the scares less subtle it might have come off as cheesy or corny, and I'm pretty satisfied with the way it is. It's a fun movie to watch with your buddies when you're just hanging out and feel like watching a movie in the dark (it helps if you're sleeping in a camper as me and my friend were last night).

The thing is, that stuff doesn't happen 'til about the very end of the film. This kind of bothers me, because the rest of the movie is kind of boring.

","I rated it 4 because the style was original. It wasn't totally commercial (product placement, etc.) and upon it's release, without public knowledge that it was a totally fictional movie, actually scared the hell out of lots of people. I don't care if some say it's based on a true story. The movie is 100% fictional. I made films in college more than 30 years ago and always did well. The potential this movie had to be a knock out success was there. Soon after the trio gets lost, the movie loses it way. Then it gets irritating. Then if falls flat on it's face, or should I say, the camera falls and we are left to speculate. Was it the witch? Was it that psycho killer?... Who cares? I lost any sympathy for the characters when their only main response to the confusion was bitching and moaning and blaming each other and using the ""F..."" word with every breath. Here's some suggestions on what could have helped this movie immensely. 1.) A little more evidence of something out of the norm could be found in the mornings after they hear spooky sounds in the night. 2.) Heather doesn't sound so ridiculously sure of herself when the map just ain't cutting it. 3.) The trio spends some logical time discussing what they are experiencing, then turn on the camera and focus on one or more of them giving a speech in regards to it, referring to notes. I really can see this as a way to build the tension. 4.) A gradual unveiling of the trios growing insanity, that even though they are walking in generally the same direction, they are coming upon nothing; impossible. How could that be? And they would video each other commenting on it. Even in the midst of death, filmmakers in war zones are dedicated to their art! These college kids, the future leaders of society, are making a documentary. At least that's what they're supposed to be doing. Their emotional outbursts in this movie is going overboard. 5.) Why doesn't just one of them try to start a fire? That would get some rangers and more. 6.) A little nudity would have helped. Come on Heather, what else is there to do? 7.) A little more controlled handling of the video recorder would have been nice. The camera work was no better than a bunch of stoned high school kids screwing around. The movie had great potential, but it was as if the scriptwriter and/or filmmakers just ran out of ideas. Well, I know this is a good cheap formula for film-making, so I'll use it in the next film I make with my nephew. He'll be in college soon. I think the quality of this film suffered when most of the money for it's production was used in the avant-garde television advertising."

You only see the tricks being played, and not consistently...but every now and then so it doesn't become repetitive but rather well timed and when you least expect or want it. The viewing through the camera gives it an unnerving realistic edge making you feel as if you are in the forest too or watching a real footage recorded by real people being tested, almost, by a real evil. All these factors collectively make the movie engaging, but not necessarily good. It is not the mark of a great movie at all, with the factors explain before acting almost comes at ease with almost able to play the part...the viewers aren't engaged with the actors necessarily but the whole array of noises, images and the general vibe the forest creates and vibe resulting from the relationship between the actors and the forest and 'witch'. This means sometimes the viewer will imagine noises which aren't even portrayed in the cinema. It is not really a movie in the sense of character and plot development, but rather an experiment to play on the audience. Perhaps that is why it is only just above an hour and nothing much really happens. The ending, itself, is also deliberately vague, giving open interpretation to the audience.

This is the best Horror film ever made, quite simply because, whether you like to admit it or not, it creeps you out.<br/><br/>I remember the night my brother and cousin went to see it in the cinema, and afterwards, my cousin who is in his twenties, didn't want to walk home by himself.<br/><br/>This is a film that takes one of the most obvious horror stereotypes- the big bad witch- removes all the cheesiness of 90% of the horrors we see nowadays- and replaces it with a brilliantly made movie that scared the bejesus outta me.<br/><br/>Its simple really- three film makers- Heather, Josh, and Mike- make their way into the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch.<br/><br/>What begins as an enjoyable film making experience quickly turns into something different as they face a terrifying experience, lost in the woods with SOMETHING after them.<br/><br/>What I liked most about the film is that its shot in a documentary style, every moment of their terrifying experience is seen first hand. The two directors promoted the film by saying it was real footage- and you forget at times that its just a film.<br/><br/>There are some real terrifying moments. The discovery of that now famous Blair Witch symbol hanging from the trees, to the tent shaking, and then the final scene in the house.<br/><br/>I believe that this is how a horror film should be made. No big breasted dumbass running up the stairs instead of the safety of the front door to escape the clutches of a crazed serial killer. What the directors have done here is they have taken a genuine fear for some people- lost in the woods- and played on it in the scariest way possible.<br/><br/>I don't think that this film has the rating it deserves on IMDb. I doubt I'll ever see a horror like it again also."

","These film makers are so annoying they get upset at the littlest things. Yes its clever and spooky but every time something happens their all like OH GOD OH NO WHATS HAPPENING! Some rocks are moved or their's sticks that look like shapes and it has to be the witch not some pranksters or someone in the group. I Did like how the movie was like a real investigation of a legend like Bigfoot the Bell witch or a Chupacabra they interviewed locals some didn't believe It some where sure it existed some thought it was based on a true event but there was no witch. I give it A 6 out of 10 It was intelligent unlike the film crew I just don't know why they thought they where trapped when some step rocks where taken out of the shallow river."
"thebackofmyhouse","9","0","2","17 October 2007"," Only scary if you think it's real.
","I watched it when it first made buzz in 1999. At that time, there wasn't much info about the movie, so I didn't know that it was staged. I seriously thought the movie was a real documentary. The night I watched it, I was at a friend's house a few blocks away, and after watching it, I was too scared to go home.<br/><br/>So, the movie only works if you don't know it's staged. If you're reading this, that means you know it's not real, so most probably you'll find the movie utterly boring. The reason this movie became a classic was because a lot of people didn't know it's not real when they watched it. It's a classic, but not a timeless classic. But for me, this movie will forever remain one the scariest movies I've ever seen."
"tanita-5","8","0","1","2 September 2007"," Absolute garbage but scary garbage.
","Making a fictional tale look like a real journal left by someone, who died in a strange way and knew they will not live long enough to tell there story is tradition in literature (Edgar Allan Poe's ""Found in the bottle"" for example) but we hardly ever see films like that, I've heard about ""The Cannibal Holocaust"" but never had a chance to see it. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a nice attempt to convince the audience that they are watching a document and for that I give the first point. The document is made by three students: Heather, Josh and Mike, who inspired by an urban legend about a mysterious baby killer known as the Blair Witch set off the woods of Maryland with cameras. There plan is simple: film some interviews with the locals, film the forest, get back home before the end of the weekend and remember the whole thing as a great adventure. They only manage to accomplish the first two points, for when they try to get back to the car they get lost in the woods, the map disappears and something - the Blair Witch? - is after them. <br/><br/>The film was promoted as an account of true events. I am sure that people who believed that this really happened, saw one of the most frightening things ever. But what is left for those who know this fiction? Not much really: the film's got the quality of home made movies, the plot reminds me of ghost stories, I wrote in my junior high days, the whole idea that one can get lost in a forest these days is ridicules- just follow a stream until you reach civilization-and the characters aren't particularly complex or interesting. Frankly this film is a peace of junk, which leaves anyone who has seen it with an impression that they can do something as good. I'd love to criticize it all the way but I can't. Why not? Maybe because I found this movie really scary, moving and memorable. The closer the characters were to their horrible end, the more I was dreading that moment. From the beginning we are focused on the three of them, we see everything from their point of view and can witness their change from a bunch of fun loving kids to desperate, angry, frighten people. We see them jumping to each others throats and comforting each other. The film really shows us what must be going on in the mind of someone, who heard some creepy stories, got lost in a strange place and feels that theirs life is endangered. I said the characters aren't complex but I don't have a problem with that, as I began to treat them as real people who don't deserve to die - interesting or not. That makes a huge difference between BWP and gore horrors like ""Hills Have Eyes"" where people are just peaces of meat with ought to be torn by the bad guys and I couldn't care less who dies. As for the amateur cinematography, it makes this film different and unique (although I am glad most movies aren't made like that) and I always believed that black and white are the best color's for horrors. I am not sure whatever this film is so good or modern horrors are so bad and I don't care. If you want to see something scary and don't mind the shaking camera, see this."
"Oceans17","5","0","3","21 August 2007"," Morons willingly run into a scary forest and toss common sense away
","I give this film a pass (just 5) because it managed to scare me (at a purely psychological level) towards the end. But the sheer stupidity of the characters is simply impossible to swallow: one of them throws the map, which in their situation is like a parachutist throwing his parachute. And, worst, when they are walking in circles, they don't think that they could just follow the river, which by the laws of physics flows downward and therefore would lead them somewhere. They could follow the river downwards, until they arrive to the sea or to civilization, or upwards, until they reach a high point from which they could see their surroundings. There's no excuse to walk in circles when there's a river in sight.<br/><br/>I admit that the shot of the upper half of the actress' face is pretty effective, but an inspired shot does not a good film make.<br/><br/>Pair this with ""Mindhunters"" and watch both if you think that the ""play"" button is at the same time the ""turn off"" button for your brain. If not, watch ""The Shining"" instead."

","This is the storied ""classic"" of 90s horror, filmed in the woods by a bunch of kids from UCF, from what I understand. It's about three college students doing a documentary about the ""Blair Witch"", and it goes well until they end up lost in the woods. The movie descends into a spiral of minimalistic fear and uncertainty. Quite a different film from what people in 1996 were used to.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? Not really. Does it work as a horror film, and is it scary? Sure, why not. This is a very minimalistic movie, no special effects or costumes or anything. No makeup. Just a bunch of kids trying to scare people, and it worked. This is some very creepy stuff at times. While it inspired countless lame knock-offs and independent films after it, I can't deny that this is a milestone. Nobody had seen anything like this before. The woods make for a very creepy setting, and the actors do their jobs surprisingly well for an indie film.<br/><br/>It sort of starts somewhere and then just...ends at random. Like a journey that you'd take, a pilgrimage. No climactic ending and no clear-cut introduction. Unique way to do a movie, for sure, but it's not really the pinnacle of film-making. There isn't any 'good triumphs evil' story, and it's all pretty bleak and dark. Not exactly the kind of thing you want when you feel depressed.<br/><br/>I'm sort of at a loss for words at this one. It's just something every horror fan has to see in their lifetime, at least once. No rating, it's too hard to decide for this kind of film."
"scyker","8","0","1","3 June 2007"," Pretty good
","I can't understand why so many people can find this movie bad. There were points that left a little to be desired, but overall the film was actually scary. The main actors actually gave a feeling of tension during the film and the plot was good and well portrayed. Of course we didn't see anything. That was the point, you idiots. People still think that the actors are dead and missing to this day. That isn't just stupid people talking. The film was made right. The acting was good and if you can pull this thing off in eight day and $22,000 then you have talent. There were points that were long, I'll admit that. My main point is that the movie was creepy and well done. It may not have deserved all that it got. But it definitely earned your money theater or renting. Whether you think so or not."

","Many movies are remembered for there endings. The Usual Suspects shocks the hell out of you, Taxi Driver makes you yell ""WHAT THE ****!"" and Rudy makes you stand up and cheer.<br/><br/>But The Blair Witch Project is an entirely different story. Its ending is so suspenseful and horrifying, it can give you nightmares for weeks and stay out of the woods for the rest of your days.<br/><br/>Besides the ending, the movie is not that scary, except for maybe 2 or 3 scenes.<br/><br/>The movie tells the ""True"" story of 3 university filmmakers shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch that haunts the woods of Burkitsville, Maryland for half a century. They decide to camp out for several days in the woods that she supposedly haunts. In the midst of it, they witness weird sights during the day and strange noises that surround them at night. In the midst of it all, the filmmakers are going through hell psychologically. The movie becomes pure horror in the last half hour 45 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Its a very original and creative movie. I give kudos to the actors for improvising all there dialog. Perfect for when on vacation or camping.<br/><br/>9/10"
"fluffyturtles235","8","0","1","15 March 2007"," The Ending...
","This is for all the people who feel the need to complain and whine about how the movie ended. If you were paying attention in the beginning, the ending would have made much more sense. The reason the ending makes sense is because in the beginning they were talking about a guy who lived in that town a long time ago, who would kill little children. He would kill the kids in pairs and make one stand in a corner as he ruthlessly killed the other one. It only makes sense as to why Mike was standing in the corner. He was killing Heather, who had followed Mikes voice to the basement. Mike simply complied with the killer. Josh probably only disappeared first because they were in a group of three, and the killer only killed in pairs of two. The killer only ""killed"" Josh to lead the other two to him, so he could kill them... I don't know about you, but it makes perfect sense if you look at it that way."

They won't be able to do this type of ""thriller"" again because everyone will remember the blair witch project!

"BaldJean","8","0","1","17 February 2007"," Really scary
","This is one of the very few movies that made me keep sitting for a while when it was over, while all around me people moved out of the cinema. I just couldn't follow them. I am very old fashioned when it comes to the way I want my horror served. No thanks, I don't want any splatter orgies; I want the horror to be slow and creeping, and I want it to be in the mind. It is not for nothing that movies like ""Don't Look Now!"" or ""Rosemaries Baby"" are among my very favorite ones of the genrè. I think the plot is constructed very well, and the rising angst and confusion of the three people appears to be genuine. Their situation somehow reminds me of Sartrè's play ""Huis-Clos"" (""No Exit""), which contains the famos line ""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" (""Hell, that's the other people""). Like the three people in Sartrè's play these three characters provide hell for themselves. Some people complain about the ""amateurish shot"" of the movie. They don't seem to have got the idea that the movie is supposed to look like a documentary, so what do you you expect? Why should three people with no more technical equipment than 2 hand held video cameras be able to make anything more than that? Any more ""perfect"" shooting of the movie would have ruined it completely. The movie is not quite up to the classics I mentioned, but I give it solid 8 stars."
"tomcartwright1988","7","0","1","10 January 2007"," Blair Witch Project
","I have watched the Blair Witch Project numerous times and have come to the conclusion that considering the budget it was made on it is a very good film. It is not the scariest horror film of all time but it will make you shiver. The hand held cameras can start to irritate one after a while but if your a film lover then it is definitely worth watching. The film uses loud screams and dark lighting to scare the audience into the back of their seat. When the first came out the viewers believed that it was real until the truth behind it was released. All characters are interesting and are well acted. The story is about three teenagers who are filming a school project, they disappear into the woods looking the Blair witch legend. All three are killed by her and the footage is found a year later. It is not a gory film but by not seeing the violence it makes it scarier because you have to imagine it."
"sweet_mate88","8","0","1","7 January 2007"," The Blair Witch Project Review
","The Blair Witch Project Review - Oliver Sequeira. BWP is a great film shot on a low budget, and this amongst others is why i class it as such a great film. The film is about three young film makers, Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams who set out to find out more about the myth of the Blair Witch and venture to the place in which the supposed being is meant to have once lived. It starts with the trio documenting themselves and preparing for their trip down to Burkettsville in Maryland. As the film progresses the trio begin interviewing locals and ask general questions about the place but as the trio dig deeper and enter the woods to find out the truth for themselves, they find that they are unwelcome and aren't to be taken to too kindly. The intentional Hype surrounding the film brought its fame and i believe its success was largely based upon this, although it must be said that the film is good and is a shining example of how successful independent filmaking can still be."
"Joy_Ride_74","Null","0","1","18 December 2006"," Wow!
","Well, when I first saw this movie, as low budget as it was, it scared the heck out of me! I had to spend the night at a friend's house because I was so scared. After a few days, I started having dreams about it. Mainly because I was convinced that the movie was real. According to the previews, this was supposed to be actual footage from the ""documentary"" these ""students"" were filming. It wasn't until weeks after I saw this film that I found out it was just another scary movie. I think that's why they did it this way. When you know something is fake, you won't scare so easily, but when you're convinced it's true or based on a true event, that's when it becomes terrifying."

","Great for a movie on the cheap. Pretty weak for a ""scary movie"".<br/><br/>I got really tired of each morning when I knew all they were gonna do is yell and shout and cry. I couldn't wait for it to become dark so they could get eaten or whatever. But nooooo they had to keep waking up.<br/><br/>Maybe those little wooden things were offerings or little gifts like a cat brings home! Maybe the witch just wanted to play with the video cameras.<br/><br/>You have to admire the tension created which forced you to watch til the end. But I admit I only watched to see the thing at the end. No such luck.<br/><br/>The freakiest thing they could do was have the dude stand in the corner like a naughty boy. Not bad, but not really freaky. Its not like turning a corner on your big wheel and seeing a couple twins standing in the hall.<br/><br/>I couldn't give it a 5 because it did force me to watch to the end, and that's something. When I think of the ""day shots"" I wanna give it a 2. The stick figures really weren't very scary.<br/><br/>I would think apathy would set in at some point when the thing continually torments you every night when it could just make you go thump. And if the witch wants folks blood, why wasn't there some yummie slurpy sounds when she made one go thump? Anyhow, good job shooting a feature film in 2 days out in the woods. Good job finding that one melodramatic actress who can Snot on Cue! Thats a rare find indeed."
"emasterslake","Null","0","1","19 November 2006"," As if you really were watching a home made video
","Blair Witch Project is a simple well made, thriller/horror flick.<br/><br/>Back in 1994, 3 student filmmakers both make a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interviewed some locals who were superstitious and religious on the subject of the Blair Witch. They say that numerous victims were killed by the witch if you trespass in her woods. So the 3 independent filmmakers go to those woods which is in the middle of no where.<br/><br/>They were enjoying their project during the first few days. But every night they hear the sounds of stones being tapped together. And it's as if it was coming from all directions. And the next morning they'd find something different near their camp site. They figure it was just a prank played by someone, but they didn't tell anyone on where they were going. And eventually they start to freak out and have suspicion that the curse of the Blair Witch is more than a legend.<br/><br/>Unlike the gory, overrated, and badly written flicks you'd see now and days. Blair Witch Project is unique and very well thought up. The cool thing is it's all filmed on student camera and video camera. Contains no visual effects, at all. It's so realistic, it'll make you think it really did happen. I won't give away the ending but it is one of those mysterious movies. And after you watch it, it'll make you think and imagine the whole movie and the student filmmakers experience."
"ficken_58","8","0","1","7 November 2006"," If you go down to the woods today you'll be sure of a big surprise!!
","The Blair Witch Project does not use much blood or gore and there are not any murders to be actually seen the film but is still mortifying and could be somewhat exciting for those who like being put in the victims shoes as it makes you imagine being lost (in the woods) as we have all been at some point in life. The build up to the lost scenes are well done as it gives us a hint of what is to come but it also distorts what is to come by not telling us a single clear insight into what is to come which keeps us wondering what could the horror ahead really be. It makes a simple thing of walking through a lot of trees seem much more scary and makes you feel more vulnerable because of it. Even the scenes of daytime are unnerving and the reasonably wide spaces between the trees gives a sense of universal space from help and the daytime makes it worse because of the fact that they cannot see any signs of humanity. The only flaw to the film is the sense of direct action, the fact that there is not anything very explicit apart from the fingers shown it makes us wonder whether if a bit more money had been spent on the film it could have been a bit better and also if the murderer had had more involvement or made an appearance. However, the film is still a very horrific and also very thrilling film. The way it has been filmed contributes significantly to the horror and realism of the film as it feels like we are one of the victims as it puts us in the driving seat to nowhere."

","At the end of the film in the house, Heather sounds as though she is screaming in the basement, she had been filming on the b/w camera and mike is shown through his colour camera as already being down there. Is the final b/w shot that pans slowly down the stairs and picks up Heathers screaming being shot by something else? Or is it that her and Mike have some how swapped cameras or the sound mix is just a little out? Either way this makes you think how weird and freaky the ending actually is, I've seen this movie a few times and I always pick up on something new, tonight it was this - maybe whatever has been following them is now filming them too on Heather's camera."

","I am confused. I would like to know one way or the other from someone who knows FOR SURE if the Blair Witch Project was real or not. I saw it in the theater when it came out...but I also bought it on video and watched it again last night. It had a short news-like video that came with the movie itself. In it were news clips of the three of them disappearing and a guy talking about how the film reels were found buried in the rubble of that house in the woods. I am having a really hard time figuring out whether or not it is real. I thought that it was real actual footage that they took before they came up missing...and that they are still missing...and that the movie was made by whoever found the film and picked up where the three of them left off...which would explain why there is a crew and a producer and such. Is that incorrect? Even if the whole thing was made up, it is still a scary movie that was well-made...but I just want to know the truth! So did it really go down the way that the film leads you to believe, or was the entire thing just a pretend thing that is entirely fiction?

","This film needed a more climactic ending. When the kids first get to the house, I thought, ""nice touch."" But nothing that happens in the house is freakier or really much worse than what was happening before (except that the characters finally get killed, presumably). Say what you want about horror movies being freakier when you ""don't see"" the horror in question (although I would argue this is a formula invented in old horror movies by very artistic directors that does not work well in every situation)--but SOMETHING more needed to happen here--another person/thing in the house who we never FULLY see, for instance.

","BE WARNED - BIG SPOILERS HERE! <br/><br/>this is one of my favourite films, i saw it in the cinema here in the UK when it first came out, after feeling intrigued by the trailer. at no point did i think it was real (i heard that for a while after the film came out, the actors decided to go into hiding because so many stupid people in America took the bait and believed it was real. oh dear.), however i was able to really put myself in their shoes, probably because it was shot in such an amateurish way. never before had i seen a film that did not show you what was supposed to be scary, and it is better for that.<br/><br/>so many people have said they thought it was rubbish because they were waiting for some big payoff or for something showy to happen. admittedly, the hype surrounding the film did give the impression of something more spectacular, which did nobody any favours. luckily for me i never read reviews of horror films for precisely that reason, just seeing the trailer was enough for me.<br/><br/>blair witch's dialogue is fine by me even with all the f-words. young people that swear will swear a lot when they're scared, and if you look into the making of this film you find out that there was no script, most of the dialogue was improvised. the bad language was not excessive because the directors had no control over it. they had only certain lines and events pre-planned and so the rest was made up. the young actors did a good job with this too.<br/><br/>as for people stating the characters were idiots for not climbing trees to look for civilisation, surely if they did they would only see the tops of more trees? they were in the forest! also someone said they should have just followed the river downstream and they would have found some way out. IF YOU HAD PAID ANY ATTENTION you would have seen they did that, but with the curse or magic of the witch they ended up in the same place they were before. to quote ""that's the tree we crossed, it's the same one"" and ""we walked south all day, i don't know how we ended up back here"" or something to that effect. surely the idiots in films are the ones who know there's someone in the house trying to kill them, so they run upstairs instead of out of the back door or through a window.<br/><br/>the ending was something really special, to find a house in the middle of nowhere like that would be creepy enough, but to hear your friend's cries coming from it is far worse. the things you see inside the house, and the final moments make all the stuff said at the beginning of the film make sense.<br/><br/>i think the guys that did this have made a superb student film, that was exploited far too much, and it was made out to be something it's not. so for anyone who hated it, please take this advice - don't believe the hype about ANY film, ever. try downloading a trailer first and if it appeals to you then go see it. you have a brain, don't let the idiots in the media ruin your cinema experience again, go and make your own decisions about these things. don't forget, the critics thought titanic was awful when they first saw it, but as soon as the public started saying otherwise they changed their tune."

"Revolution698","9","0","2","14 May 2006"," This movie deserved some more recognition
","Personally I thought The Blair Witch Project comes close to being the scariest movie I have ever seen. The publicity and hype about the film originally got me fooled into believing the entire story and footage was real, and that played a big role in making it even more effective as a scary/horror movie. They kind of got into your head a little bit.<br/><br/>What's more is that this is the only movie I have ever seen that seems to be improvised without a script(at least thats what I've read). The acting is so dramatic and real and makes you feel like you are with the characters.<br/><br/>I actually think these actors and actresses involved deserve Oscars.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the horror/scary film genre has never truly been properly recognized and respected in Hollywood or the Academy Awards, so one can only hope that someday a scary film will come along that people will finally see as worthy of recognition by nominating it for an award.<br/><br/>This film truly scared me, and the suspense alone makes it such a unique film because not much is really shown as much as heard, which brings to another point that sound effects are also important and crucial to a movie, so the sound engineers and collectors who go out and record spooky things also deserve some recognition. Its not easy to get some of the sounds they often do.<br/><br/>All in all I give this movie a 9 out of 10. I don't believe I've seen the scariest and most gut-wrenching movie of my life yet, but this one comes close (and so does the movie Saw). Definitely worth a rental, if not purchasing it, because it really is a unique film and there's nothing else like it."

","When a movie goes mainstream, it usually gets criticized heavily; you just can't please everyone. If the haters could just get pass all the hype and whatnot - while having a sense of imagination - this movie is not bad as what they make it out to be. It IS scary. <br/><br/>The documentary style was really clever, and it was definitely a key advantage in making this movie scarier than other horror movies. I thought the acting was pretty natural and made it believable.<br/><br/>This movie isn't one of those horror movies where it flashes a bunch of graphic images or sound effects at you, but it does it calmly and effectively. The ending REALLY left me with chills. People without a wide imagination will probably not find this movie scary; that's too bad. Really, to also get the full effect, it's best to watch it in the dark with no distraction. They did such a good job that some people might confuse this movie to be real.<br/><br/>I would skip Blair Witch 2, though; it was not clever or entertaining as the original. This movie will definitely put fear in people camping at night, or even worse - someone standing in the corner with their back turned (in a dark room); it was that effective."

","I originally slammed this film when I first saw it. Having had a chance to see it again in a more proper setting, I find myself changing my opinion on this film.<br/><br/>You see, the first time I saw it was on the big screen. A matinÃ©e showing, at that. How scary can anything be in a crowded building in the middle of the afternoon? The next time I saw it was at home, at night, after having watched the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' back story mockumentary. It also helped that I live near the woods. This time, I saw how truly scary this film can be. Without the sound distortion of the theater's Surroundsound system, many of the scary sounds came through much more clearly. And seeing the back story helps you to see some of the supernatural aspects (that house at the end isn't even supposed to be there!).<br/><br/>Seen the right way (at night, as close to alone as possible, near or in the woods if you can manage it), this is a horror masterpiece."

","The Blair Witch project is a film that is perfect in its simplicity. It is a tribute to the film makers that they manage to do so much on such a small budget and with so little. the reason for it's success is its masterful playing on two central themes the first of these being isolation. in the cases of the characters who are isolated in a wood it is particularly crushing as they are so close to civilisation but yet so far. The theme of fear of the unknown is exploited by the film makers because we never see the witch that is hunting them and perceive no limit to her power. this is all the more scary because our minds are left to wander over her seemingly limitless power.<br/><br/>The use of a hand-held camera to do the filming, genuine people as actors when possible and a lot of improvisation gives the film a gritty realistic edge. something that magnifys our fear as in our minds we do not see the famous actors and all to familiar Hollywood sets that would usually allow us to disbelieve but the truth.<br/><br/>when this film was released in 1999 clever promoting and rumors that the film were true meant that it arrived with a lot of hype. This may of contributed to its success but its simple story line and good Acton sti9ll make it a cracking horror film."
"lemon_magic","7","0","2","7 January 2006"," If you go out in the woods today, you'll get a BIG SURPRISE...
","""Blair Witch Project"" has come under a lot of heavy criticism for its many shortcomings, for its over-hyped/overcooked viral marketing campaign, and for its length (some critics seem to think it would have been much better as a 30 minute short subject). Many of these criticisms have merit. However, once I saw it (on VHS, long after the hype had died down), I enjoyed it quite a bit. <br/><br/>The fact that I first saw it on VHS, on my living room television, may have had much to do with my positive reaction to it. Even though it is mostly set in the woods of Maryland, BWP's tiny cast and rough, grainy, under-lit feel lend it a curiously intimate quality, as of a ghost story told around a campfire at night...and I think this quality comes across better in a dark, silent living room than a large movie theater with dozens-to-hundreds of people in the place with you. I also think the grainy, cheap, hand-held feel translates better on the small screen. It's better than it deserves to be...you might think of it as one of those 'accidents' of film making like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In fact, I am pretty sure that the editors and the choices they made were what 'saved' this film from obscurity. Many slick film makers have tried to duplicate TCM, including its director, and no one has ever completely succeeded. I think the same is true here...the film makers got lucky and they knew it. <br/><br/>Mostly, I think I enjoy BWP because I have a understand the true impact of the phenomenon that rangers and outdoors-men refer to as 'woods shock' - the devastating impact of being REALLY LOST in the woods. Modern urban dwellers can easily underestimate this impact and dismiss it because we've never been truly 'lost' in our lives. But many fit, experienced hikers and campers actually given up, laid down, and died from the stress of being lost in the North American forests and mountain ranges, often less than a day's hike from civilization and with supplies and rations still in their packs. The original meaning of the term 'bewilder' is to take someone out in the woods and get them lost, and leave them there...and it was first coined hundreds of years ago, by people who were much more comfortable in forests than we are now. <br/><br/>So I think the basic story idea, of three callow film students going for a 'simple', ordinary overnight trip into the woods and stumbling into disaster makes for compelling viewing if it is handled right...and I feel that BWP use of the plot device of hand-held cameras (documenting their growing unease, bewilderment, and finally hopeless terror), is a brilliant stroke that sidesteps the issues of slick production work , professional sound work, 'good' acting, etc.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some contrived elements that don't hold up to serious examination (especially the 'editting' of the film found in the cameras, which is much more 'dramatically apt' than a simple presentation of what happened), but that's true of almost any ghost story or horror story told around a campfire at night (""And there, on the handle...was a HOOK!!!"", etc. ""Like, I am sooooo sure...""). But I found the casts' reactions to their growing predicament credible and enjoyed the way the plot kept turning the screws on them tighter and tighter. And while the payoff may have been annoyingly ambiguous, jumbled, and hard to decipher, it was plain that something Very Bad Indeed had happened to the film students. The glimpses provided of the walls of the house where everything comes to an end are the materials for good old fashioned nightmare fuel. What WERE those markings on the walls??? <br/><br/>While the followup sequel was an unmitigated cinematic disaster, BWP succeeds as a nasty little ghost story and can be enjoyed on those terms."
"cool_abs87","5","0","1","31 December 2005"," too hyped up?
","The Blair Witch Project (BWP) can be seen as a 'love it or hate it' movie. One of the things that made this film quite exciting was the Internet marketing before its release. The information given on Internet websites told viewers about an allegedly 'true' story about the legend that is the Blair Witch. The great marketing provoked anxiety and a craving to know more about this documentary that went terribly wrong. Even to today, there are many people who know about the Blair Witch legend, and still have not seen it. However, I believed this to be one of the film's downfalls. As with many other audiences, I had high expectations of what was suppose to be one of the greatest horror films ever. It in fact was quite uneventful and the ending left me baffled.<br/><br/>Basically, the film is about three students (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams) who go to make a documentary about the Blair Witch. There are interviews with random people who are in fact not actors in which creates a realistic investigation. The students then go out into the woods and eventually get lost and it goes pair shape from then onwards. Weird things start to happen to them which include Josh getting kidnapped and the findings of severed flesh being delivered to them which a pile of twigs- very scary right? No, it was a bit icky but not that scary. Anyway, Heather and Michael find a crumbled house whilst searching for Josh and eventually they get killed while we thoroughly try to get a glimpse of the witch. The film ends with quite a disappointing tone.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it must be said that the use of camcorders in this film does create a personal and interesting experience. Not only do we get to watch the interesting parts, we get to see them doing normal activities which helps the audience to get closer to the characters. The use of only three actors in the whole film reinforces the idea of isolation but it can also become quite boring from time to time. I admire the use of suggested violence and the presence of the witch that certainly segregates this film amongst many other typical horror films.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film has to be the ending; it is disappointing and left me confused. In addition, watching a bunch of students wonder around the woods for ninety minutes did not satisfy my expectations. I appreciate the new ideas produced here to the horror genre but perhaps they should not have used propaganda to such an extent.<br/><br/>Have to applaud the film for doing so well with such a low budget however, I would not recommend this film as you may feel quite annoyed at the end."
"jandaba","5","0","1","21 December 2005"," An excellent concept that doesn't work
","One thing is obvious about this movie, even after several minutes of watching: it lacks special effects, all kinds of em. Which is a good thing, if you ask me, because movies that rely on visuals and/or sound tend do be crap, as demonstrated by the year of 2005. The concept behind BWP, however, is to make the viewer's imagination compensate for the aforementioned lack of effects. And indeed, a well-developed imagination surely is much more effective then the potential of all the animators, composers, choreographers, etc. of Hollywood put together. However, all this is somehow very poorly realized in the movie. Not creepy at all, imho. I personally had a feeling similar to watching the Animal Planet on mantis mating.<br/><br/>So out of 10 possible points, I give 5/5 for an original and very interesting, as well as ambitious concept behind the movie; and 0/5 for the actual rendition, which was dreadful."

Unfortunetely this is not anywhere near enough to have a good film, the majority of it has to be good not just the last five minutes. The way they filmed it was very interesting, they didn't tell the actors what to say or what would happen, the actors also did almost all the camera work making it bouncy and confusing which could and has made some films even scarier but in this case just gets annoying. The performances are horrible especially the girl, she is just horrible, and deserved her Razzie and should get a lifetime acheavment award from them because she has been just as bad in all her other stuff.

In the film, you don't see the witch. All you see is what you hear. You hear leaves rustle, someone screaming to the top of their lungs. It's the ""it"" factor in Blair Witch. But, if your a person that wants action and wants it quick, find another movie. The first 20 minutes is just the three friends asking questions to the towns people about the witch. BORE!!

","The Blair Witch Project, like The Ring, plays on the contemporary fear of technology, namely television. Through use of a clever advertising campaign, presenting it as a documentary, and much improvised acting, a sense of realism is captured and allows the viewer to consider how they would react in a similar position. The Blair Witch Project is very different to its horror film predecessors with its innovative hand held camera-work and 'fly on the wall' style and this works very well to allow the viewer a closer experience and more intimate relationship with the characters. Although being original and an interesting film, it does provoke many questions as to why the leading female Heather does not switch her camera off, however, as when watching most horror films, the viewer must let their cynicism go and in this case will be rewarded with a far from disappointing ending."
"DavidSim240183","8","0","1","8 November 2005"," Flawed but fascinating
","I remember how excited I was when I first heard about the Blair Witch Project. The idea of a horror film seen through the eyes of a video camera was an intriguing prospect to me. Not to mention unique in this day and age of slasher films. And although it has it's failings, the Blair Witch Project provides good, solid entertainment.<br/><br/>The three heroes of the piece Heather, Josh and Mike go off to the woods of Maryland to film a documentary about the Blair Witch. The film makes the wise choice of lulling you into a false sense of security. The opening scenes are light and comical, such as interviews with the townspeople, and witty banter between the trio.<br/><br/>But then things start to turn ominous when Heather & Co lose their way. They can't seem to get out of the woods, and what's worse, they are not alone. Someone or something, is stalking them. When they're camped out in the middle of the night, they are certain they can hear noises from outside. Noises that are gradually getting closer to them. Weird objects are left outside their campsite. The map goes missing. Josh disappears. And so on.<br/><br/>The fact that the BWP is seen through a camera gives a heightened sense of realism to the proceedings. But personally, what I found to be more effective was the way the three of them gradually come apart on each other. Heather's obsession with continuing to record the events is counter-played with Josh blaming her for getting them lost. The camera closes on her face, teary-eyed, frightened and very upset.<br/><br/>Or the scene when Mike throws the map away and confesses. The anger from Heather is so profound it was almost painful to watch. And of course we can never forget the most famous scene when Heather records a final goodbye message. Again the camera is right in her face. She now fully expects to die. Because she so freely admits it, it becomes a very powerful and moving scene.<br/><br/>These are the scenes that makes a lasting impression. BWP is never exactly all out frightening, but it is very unnerving. The psychological impact afflicting our trio is much more effective. The ending is rather unusual, because it comes so quickly. Heather and Mike come across a house. They go in. And don't come back out. We never find out what happened to them. Or what was stalking them. This makes for an anti-climatic, but pulse-pounding ending at the same time.<br/><br/>Clocking in at a lean 79 minutes was a wise choice. It keeps events moving at a fair pace, and doesn't burn itself out with over-exposure. Those jerky camera movements would otherwise get tedious after a while. The Blair Witch Project is not without it's flaws, but it does leave a lasting impression, and will make you think twice before going off on any camping trips in the woods any time soon."
"PhillyBen","7","0","1","4 November 2005"," Great premise & great ending; otherwise flawed
","I liked the Blair Witch Project, but I didn't love it. What I *did* love was the Blair Witch website that accompanied this film's release and also the mock-documentary that aired on the Sci Fi channel. If you read the website thoroughly and see the mock-documentary and THEN you watch the movie, it all adds up to a thoroughly frightening experience. Unfortunately, those extras were necessary because the movie itself left out a lot of crucial information vital to ""getting"" the full import of the story and imagery.<br/><br/>Still, the film did tap into (and probably fed) the growing fascination with ""reality"" TV and films, and it used the trick on which camp ghost stories have always relied. It's really scary to be trapped in a place where something scary was REALLY supposed to have happened. Since most of us go into the woods at some point we can imagine how terrified the movie's kids must have been, and we can feel some of that terror ourselves if we think about the allegedly ""real"" imagery when we're out in the woods.<br/><br/>One final note: the ""reality""-based scare tactic wasn't even all that original. In 1992 the BBC aired a mock documentary called ""Ghostwatch"" that pretended to be real, live-broadcast investigative journalism. Its shocking ending so terrified the television audience that it elicited hundreds of phone calls and was never aired again. THAT was a real landmark moment in mass media, right up there with Orson Welles' radio broadcast of ""War of the Worlds."""

You feel little sympathy towards the characters plight however as they seem to create their own demise. For example Mike throws the map into the river, Heather gets them lost constantly, and they don't even follow basic survival techniques despite the book Heather brought with her which must have included sections on compass readings and possible reasons for it leading them in a circle. It would have said follow the river!! Leads away from the source which is in the Forest! Obvious!! Despite the above let downs, this film has got some serious good points. As a horror fan i like to see a good plot, a decent believable cast and a solid scare. This film delivers an original plot that has intrigue surrounding it from the get go. The cast are very believable as you see their true reactions, partly due to the filming and production techniques of withholding food etc!! And lastly this has the scare is amazing.

","although many slate the Blair witch project, all things considered, it does have some tense moments, as the audience never see 'the Blair witch', its just left up to our imagination which is a technique that is not employed in many other films. for ages people were unsure as to whether or not the film was true footage of students making a documentary that was discovered at a later date, but we now know it to be a fake, however, the amateur hand-held camera did have some people fooled and its clear that the actors were at times terrified as the producers were scaring them during the night. tension is often built by the use of camera work, for example, as the characters run through the woods, and the camera is jumping about the place, the audience is unsure as to what they can see, and in our own minds, we may imaging figures through the trees which is a sinister effect. another aspect of the film which i liked was the turbulent relationships of the characters. we see them under great stress, and this soon begins to erupt into arguments about who got them lost, and if there really is a 'Blair witch'... one criticism would be that, although the ending is left open to interpretation, it was a bit of an anti climax as we really don't see anything, and when the camera goes black, we are left asking the question..""was that it!?"" all in all, due to its originality, i would recommend this film to others if you prefer a more psychological film rather than a typical slasher or teen horror movie."

","By now, everyone and their grandma has heard about this super-cheap project that ended up making millions upon millions in the summer of '99. Now it's out on video and that's where it really belongs: it was mostly shot on HI8 Video, with some 16mm film. Watching it, especially the beginning (before the 3 characters go into the woods), I am reminded of similar video footage I took on a couple of past road trips; you know what I mean? - stuff taken from a moving car; people walkin' around not really doing anything. The difference is, of course, I didn't make $140+ million off of my stuff. Silly me. As a film, it's a mixed bag. The 1st 20 or so minutes, as I mentioned, are nothing more than a boring home movie. But then, the tension starts to mount - and I'm not really sure why: is it the jerky hand-held camera movement? The 'real world' sound effects? After all, one is supposedly watching real stuff, not a make-believe reel movie. That was the whole hook of the project - the thing that drew so many people to it (I believe the technique is called 'cinema verite' - a French term for realism). And, true to form, the film doesn't really 'end' - it just stops. There are no spelled-out answers in the end, forcing audiences to make their own conclusions (I did). But, also in the end, I don't think this will take its place among classics such as Night of the Living Dead[68] or even The Evil Dead[81], because the thing's a triumph of marketing, not cult horror. It's clever, it's creepy, it's unique. But it's a manipulation designed to draw grosses, not gross out people in a new exciting way (the R rating is for foul language). OK, I bought the DVD."

It was more of a psychological fear rather than a visual one. I went out to a local independent theater (The Bridge in San Francisco) to see it on the second night of its release. Months later, it was released into mainstream theaters like AMC and CENTURY theaters. By then, however, its marketing strategy of the ""missing"" students was used up and we all knew it was a big ol' hoax! (although, in my heart of hearts, I knew they couldn't possibly release a film with actual footage of people being killed for our viewing pleasure)<br/><br/>If you read the reviews on this film, there's a huge difference of opinion from its reviews as a fresh new ""indie"" film up 'til now. <br/><br/>I would have to say that this was never meant to be a film to last through the ages. It had its 15 minutes of fame and it's all done with by now. I didn't quite enjoy watching it. It made me dizzy, but the mental horror it gave me was great in the end.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is historical for its ability to bring audiences in through sheer curiosity and great marketing. After I saw it, I looked it up online and they had a whole site dedicated to the hoax with ""evidence"", ""interviews"", photographs, and more. I totally bought it! Marketing to an internet audience was never done like this before in 1999. Keep in mind that, back then, the internet almost seemed like it wouldn't lie to you. I had used it more for information rather than entertainment.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain about the lousy acting, editing, sound, lack of plot, but, come on! It was meant to be a shitty looking film. It allowed a lot of us to just take in what little we knew of the story and create it in our own heads. It was more real than a lot of people give the actors credit for. They really did feel like crap out there without much else to do, but keep improvising and moving along in the woods. If it was meant to have good acting, the movie would have failed. Don't knock a film that was meant to look as crappy as it did.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think the movie itself was great (once I found out it was all fake!), but I think, for its time, its still a cult landmark.<br/><br/>Also, visit http://www.blairwitch.com to see why the internet buzz was so hot back then!"

","Film-making can be quite an interesting business. Some would insist on calling it an art, and they would also be correct. But make no mistake: Making movies is a business. When you think about the mountain of money this little indie project made as opposed to the paltry sub-fifty thousand dollar budget it had, you almost have to laugh. Then consider some of the big budget bombs we've seen recently like Kingdom of Heaven, Alexander, and XXX State of the Union that have been nothing more than an epic waste of money. You'll see why sometimes a little originality can lead to a big payday.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is essentially a bogus documentary about three young filmmakers who journey into the Maryland wilderness to investigate the legend of some gruesome goings-on. The group quickly finds themselves hopelessly lost, and at the mercy of god-knows what just past their line of vision in the surrounding foliage. The film is absolutely scary. You cannot deny that for one minute, but to think that anyone could have believed this is actual footage of three people meeting their demise is laughable. Apparently some people insist on believing it, though. You cannot deny the success of the technique. What we CANNOT see is often more scary than what is right in front of us in plain view.<br/><br/>What we have here is a triumph not of special effects and great casting, but a triumph of ideas and atmosphere. Why is it that almost every mainstream film in the past couple years has been a sequel, a remake, or something based on a comic book? Is it any wonder why the box office numbers have been down for 17 straight weeks??? To all studio execs out there: The public is tired of watching crap! We need more inspiration and more originality! And to the makers of The Blair Witch Project: This Hound solutes you! Great job! 8 of 10 stars."

","Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked <br/><br/>For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, and legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their ""found"" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history.<br/><br/>The film does hold up. Its uniqueness is more important that its quality, but there's not a lot unique out there. This is one of those great Saturday-wanna-scare-the-crap-out-of-you-Night movies, a true ghost story I severely enjoyed this one"
"rafa_lombardino","8","0","1","25 May 2005"," The mean which that turned capitalist!
","""The Blair Witch Project"" may be considered a great revival for the supernatural pranks we have all participated in during our teenage years. Being interested in the unknown is something natural for those who had their imagination stimulated year after year by ""The Twilight Zone"" during the 50's and 60's, by ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" and ""Unsolved Mysteries"" in the 80's, or by ""The X Files"" more recently. Each time had its monsters and presented them as it suited their audiences: scientists experimenting without any conscience, aliens taking over the Earth, mutants resulting from genetic engineering programs or simply the dark side of human beings.<br/><br/>The idea of creating a legend, making a movie, and having fun at the same time may have been ingeniously conceived by directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who probably couldn't anticipate how profitable their project would be. However, the movie was produced with extreme perfectionism, from casting to experimental screenings to test the public's reaction, besides their innovative filming methods.<br/><br/>Using two cameras  a 16mm and another one for ""homemade"" videos  Myrick and Sanchez depicted the escalating fear manifested by Heather, Mike, and Josh, the three characters who are lost in the middle of a forest while trying to collect enough evidence to prove that the witch does exist. In order to obtain total realism from these amateur actors, the directors limited themselves to direct from a distance, handing them a draft for the script with a list of scenes that were going to be filmed during the day along with some food and a map that would give them a clue to where their next meeting would take place. The directors' objective was revolutionize the Hollywoodian way of making scary movies, refusing to give away when those typical scary moments would come and when the audience should scream. That was why the actors, while really exploring their field, were constantly scared by their directors' pranks.<br/><br/>Another differential was not showing the characters on a daily routine. Sex scenes? No way! Who would feel romantic about being lost in the middle of the woods? There's only place for exhaustion, frustration, and total shock  what led audiences to believe that they were watching a real documentary. The only thing that seems to have been surgically analyzed is the psychological pressure the movie would put their audience under.<br/><br/>The great marketing force behind the ""Blair Witch"" must be attributed to the company that was responsible for the distribution. After considering how critics and other entertainment authorities rejected the movie at the Sundance Festival  which was the first time it was presented in its final format after all the experimental screenings  Artisan decided to heavily invest in the box office. The core of their marketing strategy was the movie's website, which was updated on a weekly basis and affirmed that it was all a true story: three young people from Maryland had disappeared indeed. Several ""news articles"" would back up the fact that the witch is the ghost of a woman who had been burned to death during the Inquisition, besides quoting witnesses to a mass murder from the 40's when a man killed seven kids after being told by the witch's ghost to do so. This was such a fool-proof plan that the website even presented statements from the missing kids' families and day by day more tapes were being found by the students' friends in the woods.<br/><br/>Actually, this mockery is not talked about at all. How far can studios lie to get a blockbuster? Well, we should say that lying is out of question, but in these days when everybody has to gamble in order to profit, this may have been one of the most brilliant ideas in a long time. Besides, it's stupid to think a website could have attracted so many followers, right? Or may not"

","Three young film students - Josh, Mike and Heather - pack up their filming equipment and head out to Burkittsville, Maryland on an autumn weekend to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a local legend which continues to haunt the surrounding woods of the small town. The three strike out into the forest with their camping gear and are never seen again. <br/><br/>One year later, their film footage is recovered. <br/><br/>It's a great basis for a horror movie. What could be worse than actually finding a roll of film or two only to discover that, upon development, it contains the dark and horrible story of a missing persons last moments on earth? The hype surrounding this film was so well done that people still believe to this day that what they are seeing is real. And while the hype may have gone a tad overboard (I don't think, for instance, that this is the scariest movie EVER made) The Blair Witch Project is still a very good, well made pseudo-documentary/ horror movie. <br/><br/>Made with hand-held cameras and boasting no special effects whatsoever, Blair Witch takes us out into the middle of the dark and spooky woods and leaves us there with the three unfortunate college kids. It's kind of like being dropped into a particularly vicious retelling of Hansel and Gretel. Strange noises echo through the woods at night, the disturbing laughter of children can be heard and many odd and primitive symbols, made of sticks and resembling crude, miniature scarecrows, are left dangling in the trees for us to find. They are all keys to a mystery which only gets larger and more sinister as the film progresses. The threesome are soon lost and find themselves wandering around in circles, unable to escape from the cursed woods, and this, for me, is where the real horror of the film lies. It can happen and, witch or no, your imagination can conjure up any number of monsters out there in the darkness, heard but never seen, but all of them waiting to eat you. Josh, Heather and Mike begin to fall apart, turning on each other and just as quickly holding on to one another as the woods loom up and consume them. <br/><br/>Nothing is ever seen, no answers are given and the mystery surrounding the Blair Witch and the exact fate of the threesome is never solved. We are left to decide for ourselves if the stories are true and the evil rumored to be within the woods is real. The premise here is simple and the film itself very realistic. It's easy to see why it frightened so many people upon its release - at times, it's like watching a snuff film without the sex.<br/><br/>Gritty, well-acted and genuinely disturbing. People who suffer from motion sickness should probably avoid it, since the constantly jouncing camera IS rather nauseating. People tired of car chases, obligatory sex scenes and CGI monsters should check this out - it's a very cool throwback to the ghost stories told around campfires. Very well done."

","Concept for ""Blair Witch Project"" sounded very interesting, when I first heard about it: a ""documentary"" about kids lost in woods, chased by a scary scary witch. There was lots of talk about this being actual thing that had really happened. Yeah. Right. But funny thing was, that some people really did buy that.<br/><br/>So, concept was in order and I even saw this in a theatre with a friend. It wasn't half as good as it was claimed to be. Acting was poor, writing was even worse and direction was non existing. It all was just stuff, that anyone, and I really mean anyone could film with their own home video cameras, as it actually was done with this. The basic difference here is, that someone succeeded in marketing this outside ""Americas Funniest Home Videos"".<br/><br/>So in summary, silly kids running around in ""woods"" while the scariness factor of the flick runs somewhere between ""Sesame Street"" and ""Winnie the Pooh"""

But the reason i gave it a 9 was because of the only flaw, they just keep the camera rolling, if i were lost in the woods i wouldn't keep the camera rolling.

"boomcar61","Null","0","1","28 February 2005"," Finally
","Having just viewed 'The Blair Witch Project' for the fourth time, I am very pleased to announce that I have finally decided on a rating score, which I will mention later. This was a hard one to do a review on because I noticed different things each time that I watched it. I know that using the word ""things"" can be pretty vague, but just watch this and you'll get an idea of what I mean it to pertain to. Ultimately, I considered that as far as originality goes it probably deserves a ten, and as for its psychological horror approach, in my opinion, it should get a five. Then there is Heather Donahue's acting, and, well, I just decided not to go there. So I will end up rating 'BWP' somewhere between five and ten.<br/><br/>The film has some scary moments(mostly at nighttime), granted you should probably keep the volume at full blast since I failed to hear these scares on my first two viewings. The ending was pretty intense, and a little shocking, to say the least. The acting, collectively, was believable and the bumpy camera movements definitely add a touch of realism. 'Blair Witch Project' turned out to be, in some ways, a very genuine horror movie, and it was definitely ambitious and creative, not to mention extremely profitable. I'm also fairly certain that it's considered a cult classic among critics and viewers alike. As for myself, I'm not too fond of it. In this kind of genre it's really not my cup of tea. Still, I will definitely recommend it to the hardcore movie-goer because it really is a rarity in the horror genre. Whether or not it's a worthy one is up to the viewer.<br/><br/>6/10 is my final vote. Followed by the Hollywood-ized sequel 'Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2'."
"sketch_09","8","0","1","19 February 2005"," More Documentary than Film.
","One of the reasons that people hated this movie i think was that they viewed it on the cinema screen, which considering that this was more of a documentary like experience than a piece of well thought out cinematography would hurt the movie in that it's true impact was sorely missed. If you want to see this film the right way, see it on a television screen, the way documentaries are supposed to be viewed, as a late night non-fictional documentary. I say non-fiction as this is the frame of mind the film wants you to think in, and this is it's main strength and why it must be seen as a documentary, not a piece of cinema. Knowing this then, you can throw away anguishes of bad acting, since most of the script was improvised and spontaneous, so it borders on the definitions of acting and a document of people's emotional journeys through frightful times. And by God, are they frightful. This is not a happy movie.<br/><br/>This film grips you into the myth of the Blair witch right from the start, with interviews with numerous towns folk sewing the tapestry that is the story by making creepy descriptions of sightings made and rumours of what really might be in the woods, that creates the foreboding aura that follows the three teens as they make their way into the feared woods. A line from a woman answering a question of whether she visits the woods at all after describing almost the entire myth as preposterous, ""Oh I don't go up there ... no ..... I know enough not to go up there."" really just sets the scene as to what these kids might be sticking their fingers into.<br/><br/>From there on in, it's an engaging, atmospheric, visceral and down right unnerving experience that never tells you everything but leaves enough on the screen to tell the tale of paranoia, terror and the overall deterioration of the human psyche under forces not known and never revealed to the eyes of the onlooker. You'll never look at the purpose of film the same way again."

","I had heard some mixed comments about this movie, so when i rented it I really had no expectations. I'm glad i didn't, because this is one of THE WORST films i've ever seen. Not only is the plot weak (although the idea of this story being real was very well marketed), it was not at all scary! Let me just say, I scare fairly easily, and yet by halfway through this film, I was falling asleep with boredom. The movie follows three teenagers on a film making adventure into the woods to create a documentary on a local legend - the Blair Witch. Then while they are in the woods, (suposedly) creepy things start to happen... Thats pretty much all there is to this film. Not even the descent into helplessness by the main characters as the journey unfolds could hold my interest (and I sat through Gosford Park...twice). Nothing scary ever happens, just a few weird noises and abnormal rock formations, and thats basically it. I suppose the scares in this movie are meant to come from fear for the main characters in their somewhat unfortunate situation. Sadly, because nothing seriously dramatic (or even attention grabbing) ever happens, as a viewer I couldn't see what the big deal was. I know its supposed to be realistic, and we're meant to see ourselves in that situation, but by that stage I was disenchanted with the whole painful ordeal. Of course, there is the question of the mysterious Blair Witch herself. She is supposed to command fear because we never see her, leaving her as an invisible force of danger. Sorry, still not good enough. Because we are never shown the witch in the act of moving rocks or stalking the teenagers, we are meant to assume it was her, I quite honestly didn't feel threaten at all. Even the (exciting?)climatic sequence left much to be desired, such as an actual conclusion, and I found myself relieved that I could then find a more riveting was to waste my time (such as watching paint dry). If you are one of those people who thought that The Blair Witch Project was the scariest film of all time, I suggest you watch Bambi. It'll scare you senseless."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>The wild hysteria surrounding this movie proves that the majority of the cinema going audience can still be fooled into believing anything they see or hear, or think they do, but that doesn't change the fact that it is an extremely convincing and effective horror flick. A certain number of people on these boards, and who have reviewed B. Witch Project HATE the film for varying, understandable reasons. When i first watched this, i watched intently, knowing exactly what the directors were playing at, and i found great enjoyment in watching the reactions of those who thought it was real. Did it unsettle me? No. Did it make me jump like the horror movies that rely on loud noises to scare (the Ring Remake) ? No. But it was the first horror movie in a very long time to put a smile on my face, and make me shiver. If you can remember back to when you played hide and seek as a kid- the feeling you had when the person looking for you was 10 feet away and coming closer- that is what this film gives, in a much greater quantity.<br/><br/>It is slow moving, and if you do not enjoy the pace, then you may not enjoy the film, but it compensates this by being short and concise, juxtaposed against how the 3 campers must have felt as the hours dragged by- the point i take from this is that in life we only remember a series of memories, images pasted together to make little sense, and life seems much shorter than it actually was.<br/><br/>The camera use and grainy feel again may be fuel for hatred or love, but it works perfectly- they don't know what is going on, and neither do we, but that doesn't matter because in an uncertain and threatening situation, the natural human reaction is to run or fight. Drained, exhausted, paranoid, they run. Ever had a nightmare about running away from something, but not knowing exactly what it was, or why you are running?<br/><br/>The best part of the movie (apart from the hilarious 'i kicked the map into the river' scene) is the last few minutes when Michael and Heather enter the house following Josh's screams. I get the 'shivering' feeling throughout this (probably 'spine tingling' or 'chilling' is the 'correct term'), especially when Heather screams, and the ending is excellent as our feelings and fear somehow builds and climaxes (apologies for the sexual connotations) in perfect harmony with what is happening on screen. The actors are clearly convincing, again look at the hysteria for proof, and although they are not called upon to do much, they do it well. Oh yeah, the only scene i do not like is the 'Heather snot' scene- it is too long and breaks up the momentum. Few great horror films come along these days, this is one- embrace it, let yourself be sucked in to feel the full effect, don't be critical, and realize how good it is. 9 out of 10"

","I saw this movie long after it was released. I rented the video from the local library. I knew the bare outline of the movie, which is what you learn in the first 5 minutes. I thought this is a great idea, using a supposed documentary made by the actors as the basis for a movie. It occurred to me that there were all kinds of possibilities of using the camera to reflect the relationships between the actors - what was filmed, what was left out, who was doing the filming, etc. None of this was done. The 3 college students in the film had a collective vocabulary of about 100 words, every other one of which was an expletive. They had no historical or philosophic interest in their project. They apparently did no prior research and seemed to take the whole thing as some sort of a joke. It was apparent from the start of the movie that they were all going to die and I found myself not particularly caring. If I had been camping with this trio I would have been tempted to strangle them right from the beginning. God they were shallow and boring. Needless to say I did not find the film frightening, which was the whole point."
"crittercat","8","0","1","29 September 2004"," A good film that might have been better...
","Before anything else, let me say that I liked Blair Witch: Nice concept. Well executed. In particular, I appreciate the film makers allowing the central enigma of the movie to remain intact. Peter Weir's in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" makes a similar choice. It takes strength of character and confidence to make this kind of choice. It speaks reams about their potential.<br/><br/>Already a thing of talk among independent filmfolk long before it hit theaters, BWP had poked itself into my consciousness a year or so ago. The buzz. The buzz! A website before it was a film. The website, itself, less a billboard than a computer game. The lore: Really cheaply made -- 60 grand, 25 grand, 10 grand! for crineoutloud -- the whole thing improved in the woods in eight wet and stinky days; they gave a trio of actors a couple of cameras and a DAT, led them on a scavenger hunt for clues, left sketchy notes and mind-screwed the cast into near-real fear and panic and late night woodland snipe-hunts. It was all so hip, so coolly generated, so clever. Forget that it had been done before. Forget ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and others...this one had integrity and a kind of kick-ass honesty about it. Just following all the material about the film before it opened, you just knew that -- if successful -- it was going to be one of those demiurge filmevents that redefined the business and would spawn a thousand mini-urges flailing for a ride.<br/><br/>The buzz and hype! And it's all true. There it is: kind of lovely and clever. It HAS integrity. You like those three people. You buy their weaknesses and still you like them because they're weak like you are weak. They're jerks, but still you like them because they're jerks like all of us.<br/><br/>The actors are good, the self-revelatory stuff is honest -- forget how they did it. (John Ford gave Victor McLaglen the next day off and got him drunk as a skunk the night before the big trial scene in ""The Informer."" Crack of day the next day, Ford dragged McLaglen out of bed and shoved him in front of the camera. Sleep-stupid and whisky-blubbering, fuzz-gargling his lines, shaking all outside and in, McLaglen acted his way through the day and earned an OscarÂ™ for his hangover.)<br/><br/>So there! Who cares how they got there, they got there!<br/><br/>And there it was. The personal hype machine worked well for these guys, the short booking worked for them boosting their per screen opening to stratospheric levels. Great.<br/><br/>I still went in thinking the movie was going to be just okay. It was better. It was very good. They might have done a little more with the sound. They might have built the tension a little more. They might have paced it better. They might have... They could have-should have...<br/><br/>Well. It worked.<br/><br/>I will say: I came out of the theater not frightened but moved. I left the theater more impressed with the film makers than their film. Ah, phooey! It was a good night out.<br/><br/>It is, finally, a very good film that could have been better."

","I finally saw this (on television, even) day before yesterday, and it still lingers in my mind. I find it amazing that there is such a large number of viciously negative comments for this film.<br/><br/>I'm even more amazed at the reasons for these negative reviews:<br/><br/>1) Once you knew that it was a ""hoax"", some or all of the interest value of the film was lost.<br/><br/>Yeah, right. Ever heard of ""suspension of disbelief""? Or are some of us under the impression that if we went to New York and hung around long enough, we would eventually see Spiderman swinging around? Trust me, I was born and raised in New York City. He ain't there. The whole point of a movie is to pretend that the circumstances under which the movie is occurring are true. I admit that having real-world confusion on that point (of whether this is true or not) enhances the experience, but it is not necessary.<br/><br/>2) Boring and irritating characters/lag in storyline.<br/><br/>Goes back to the first point... these are not ""characters"", they are people who happen to have filmed themselves. If any one of us made a film of ""My hike in the woods"", or ""My party"", we would likely be seen as boring or irritating by a fair number of people (especially if we really were), and the ""story"" of our experience would undoubtedly ""lag"" in the eyes of the viewing audience. Life is mostly boring. People are mostly boring, too. But (again, going back to the first point) this is the only record left of the end of these small lives. If I was the company responsible for releasing it as found footage, I wouldn't have the heart to cut it for ""time"" or ""interest value"", either.<br/><br/>As to the ""whining and cursing""-- well, they were all quite young. Young adults tend to obsess about things, whine, blow things out of proportion, and try to micromanage things that they don't fully understand (often because they don't fully understand them). They also tend to have foul mouths, since they are finally old enough to say ""forbidden words"" without having those mouths washed out.<br/><br/>I don't know how the complaining viewers expect people suffering from age-induced self-absorption, multiplied by participating a naturally egotistical endeavor in a career field that encourages self-absorption and obsessive behavior, to behave when discovering that they are in mortal danger that they didn't even believe in (in addition to being delirious from hunger and sleep-deprived), but I thought the film nailed it pretty well.<br/><br/>3) Irrational, survival-negative behavior.<br/><br/>As far as the ""just drop the camera and get the heck out"" contingent-- well, clearly you don't know filmmakers and camera people. But even those of you who don't might remember the outcry over the cameraman who filmed a protester (against what, I don't remember) as the protester proceeded to light himself on fire, and did not drop the camera to stop him, or to put him out. Documentary makers, camera people/photographers, news collectors-- they tend to obsess over documenting what they see, rather than participating in it. And directors-- most notably ""auteurs""-- tend to obsess and micromanage the film that they are making. Many (think Hitchcock) feel it is their duty to do so. They may be right to think so; obsessive micromanagement is often a valuable job skill for a movie director.<br/><br/>Heather, Mike, and Josh even discuss/argue about the use (or overuse) of the hand-held camera in two separate places. That's how obvious an issue it is (so those commentators who mention it aren't even telling the people in the film something they don't know). But when people feel powerless (as they often do when in mortal danger), they tend to cling to something familiar, which gives them some sense of control over the situation. And for these people, continuing to record, to document every detail, served that purpose.<br/><br/>As far as the map and compass-- everyone who has complained about this assumes that these items still worked properly. They clearly did not, otherwise how could one (very carefully) go south all day and wind up walking in a circle? There are several indications that the hunter had some ability to bend perceived reality-- and a compass and map are no use if you see them as saying something they do not.<br/><br/>The sequel picked up on this implicit ability and made a big deal about it (the sequel was shown right after, so I saw them both in a single viewing), so it seems clear that the students were being herded the whole time, and their technological tools were useless. Walking in the creek might have helped, but I wouldn't have bet on it. The hunter ruled her domain for a couple of hundred years. I don't so much think that there was an escape option that would not have been blocked.<br/><br/>4) ""Nothing scary"".<br/><br/>Everything is scary when you are *not safe*. And the meaning of the stick men, the rock piles, the noises was simply to say, ""This is my place. I know you are here. And you are not safe.""<br/><br/>Even the most minimal sign is pretty alarming when you can't escape an unsafe place, you know that you are being hunted by something that wants to kill you just for being there-- and the sign it left is clear evidence that it knows you are there (when lack of such knowledge was about your only hope of survival).<br/><br/>5) No visible enemy/answers<br/><br/>What I liked best about this movie (other than the ending, which was fab), is that it's much more like real life than most horror movies are. TV shows like CSI and movies like Se7en lead you to believe that there will be some thread to tie everything together, but even the victims in those films/shows didn't have that thread. Much of the time, bad things ""just happen"" and you have no idea why. And you never find out, either. Things happen on somebody else's agenda, and due to your ignorance of that agenda and your designed powerlessness, you get whacked, and that's just it. Someone else might find a coherent thread at some point, or might not, but that doesn't answer the essential ""Why"" (me? is this happening? was this not prevented before it came to pass?) that everyone has when something bad happens. Such a thread of understanding wouldn't likely help the victims anyway. And in this movie, that is who we are identified with-- not the hero cop or detective who solved the mystery ""before she could kill again"". There are none such present.<br/><br/>Who was the Witch? Was there even a Witch? Why was Mike in the corner? What killed Heather, and how? What happened to Josh? Was that even him we heard crying out? What is the point of all this bloodletting anyway?<br/><br/>Why would we ever know the answer to these questions? The Witch (if there is a Witch) obviously kills most everyone who wants to put the story together. Clearly the Witch (if there is a Witch) is not interested in fame or her story being understood-- she's got an agenda of her own, and she follows it. If it's some psycho pretending to be the Blair Witch, they wouldn't want to be caught, or destroy the myth, as that confusion works for them.<br/><br/>So no, the 'evidence' found doesn't answer anything. Even the (pretty awful) sequel didn't fall into that trap. In that way, not only does the film retains consistency with its own internal logic, but that internal logic is much closer to common logic than what you normally see.<br/><br/>For that reason alone, this is quite a good film, especially if you are interested in film. It is also quite creepy if you take it as what it's claiming to be-- a last message from the unsung dead.<br/><br/>Which is spooky enough right there, imo."

","it just bores me to see some cgi monster scare the crap out of some idiotic teenagers or piles of bloody guts being thrown throughout the screen. bit this is something different. and what makes this peculiar film different from the others is that its creators understood the essence of fear: that it is a reaction of the brain to external factors; everything is going on in your head, and it doesn't necessarily happen only if you see some dead guy trying to kill you. being lost in the woods during several days can be enough to install a state of terror; add to that fatigue, hunger, tension between the three filmmakers and, of course, the noises and the piles of rocks etc. he'd it been filmed in a different way, the film couldn't even be called thriller or drama... it is the apparent verosimility given by the amateur-like shooting that does the thing. you can always escape the atmosphere of an average horror film by telling yourself it's just make-believe, but it's not the case here. basically, the script is almost non-existent (it could be abridged to <<walking through the forest... ""we're lost..."" ""we're f**king lost..."" ""no we're not lost, i know exactly where we are!""...walking through the forest... ""we're lost!"" ""we're f**king lost!"" ""no, we're not lost... umm... yup, yes we are... where's that f**king map?"" walking through the forest... ""sh*t, we've seen this log before..."" walking through the forest... ""hey, where's josh? josh!"" ""jooosh!!!""... walking through the forest...""hey that was josh... josh!"" ... walking into a house... ""josh!"" ""mike!"" the end>>). and yet the tension increases from the beginning to the very end, the ""witch""'s presence is just suggested, creating psychological terror, which appeals to the viewer's imagination instead of his senses. the action isn't complex at all, the characters neither, and yet all that pointless walking around of some stupid kids who got lost, their arguments, their crossing over from carelessness to panic and even insanity keep you tied to your seat. some have said that the film lacks really ""scary shit"". frankly, i prefer this kind of horror to a guy wearing a cheap death mask stabbing people."

","To condemn a film purely because it was hyped beyond all proportion is narrow-minded and dismissive. The Blair With Project was shot with a budget of only $30,000 and made millions at the bow office. This, however, does not change the fact that despite such a low budget, the film still delivered everything it promised.<br/><br/>Many find the absence of an actual 'monster' or visible focus for the fear created during the film as a disadvantage. In fact, it is the invisibility of this presence that makes this film truly terrifying. Only those with a shallow imagination and an even shallower outlook need an actual bodily focus for the fear that was so subtly and artfully composed in the film.<br/><br/>The acting was supposedly disappointing but the was no need to have actual actors. The rawness of using 'real-life' teenagers to animate the story was a stroke of genius. Having said this, however, the story was faked anyway so the sincerity of the screenplay was slightly undermined. It is refreshing to see less than perfect faces on screen and hear exactly what real teenagers would have said in the situation, which was mostly f**k.<br/><br/>The fear did, admittedly, take time to build up but the tension created was worked beautifully into the storyline and made the ending all the more terrifying. The ending scene, which shows one of the teenagers against the wall, was a masterpiece of filming yet came across as so raw and involving.<br/><br/>One of the most criticised films of the past decade-should not be subject to prejudice.<br/><br/>A*"

I'd heard the truth about the film before seeing it, so I knew it was a fake...<br/><br/>However, the backstory given by interviews in the first part of the film, and then watching those interviews unfold were what MADE this film so unsettling. The final scene had me a bit haunted for days (probably because I had paid attention to what was said at the beginning).<br/><br/>It didn't help that I walked home in pitch dark New England fog, either.<br/><br/>BWP is an intentional mind-screw (since we're not allowed profanity).

Yes. Do you want to throttle them for being morons? Heck yeah. But their descent from somewhat annoying, but intelligent, inquisitive people into complete paranoia within a matter of days is what is so chilling.<br/><br/>The impact has lessened on subsequent viewings- but the lack of gore is brilliant, in my mind.

","""The Blair Witch Project"" was original on it's time, that is the late 90's. It's not the first time that a concept like this was used as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1978) has the exact same premise. The 19780's movie was too graphic (extreme gore) unlike the 1999 movie that attacks the audience with psychological terror (everything's in the imagination).<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" shines because it exercises the audience's capacity to create terror and feel it on their own way.<br/><br/>*** If you feel frightened or scared it's because you have a HIGH capacity to create terror in your mind. Depending on how much you get scared, the more pleasant the experience of the movie will be. If you get very scared then you've seen too many horror movies and you have a big capacity to create horror. That means you can feel horror. This is the best thing about ""Blair Witch"". ***<br/><br/>I can't say if it's whether or not a good movie, I see it more as an experiment to rate your capacity to be scared. Psychological terror is the most effective way to experience a horror movie. Texas Chainsaw Massacre succeeded in that field but it got aid from the graphical violence and the frightening characters. ""Blair Witch"" talks about a witch and spirits. How do you imagine witches and evil spirits? That depends on you. Now when the movie attacks you with the lead characters' P.O.V. you feel the uncertainty of not knowing what's going on and that's when your mind plays it's part by creating a whole different story in your mind. Also, the producers created a brilliant publicity campaign by saying that these are real life events. Before watching the movie that raises the scare factor and it's up to you if you believe or not the premise. The producers tried so hard in making a truly frightening movie and it worked for a big auditory. The movie has also many detractors and it's completely normal because ""Blair Witch"" can't awake everybody's capacity to create terror. I liked this movie very much mainly because I'm a die hard fan of horror movies and supernatural things. <br/><br/>The movie is OVERRATED because the critics and members of the ""Scream"" generation made it commercial. It's an independent film with minimal expectations that was viewed as an MTV type of movie and that's what affected the movie. Watch it as a part of horror movies history, it totally deserves the watch. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is as effective as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in the aspect that you have the chance to create horror in your mind. <br/><br/>Good effort!

What I saw was a short movie with a great premise and a few really good suspenseful/scary scenes that had been stretched out to feature length by seemingly endless footage of the hapless principals wandering about lost in the woods and - even worse - continually whining about it. I was not a happy camper.<br/><br/>Later, a few other members of my family saw the movie and they literally ranted and raved about how creepy it was and how a woman they saw at a local carnival was the spitting image of Mary Brown. This incident triggered a large number of conversations among their friends and family. The capper came when my wife watched it on Cable and it gave her the major ""willies"".<br/><br/>I began to think that maybe I had been too harsh in my judgment and that this movie deserved another viewing.<br/><br/>Well, I have watched this movie about a half dozen times and I have good news and bad news. The good news is that it can be spooky fun for a while. The bad news is that the total quality time in this movie amounts to only about 1/3 of the running length.<br/><br/>I am still impressed with the concept and with the genuinely creepy look of some of the scenes but the best score I can muster is 5 points out of 10.<br/><br/>I would really like the originators of this movie (or someone else who sees the potential for a really GOOD horror movie here) to re-imagine the project and , perhaps, include more of the back story (Rustin Parr and the Blair Witch herself).

","There is a certain amount of ""evolutionary baggage"" inherent in human nature. We as humans all have ""buttons"", that when pushed just right can evoke a strong emotional response. Stephen King has referred to these as ""psychic pressure points"". Examples: fear of the dark. Fear of being lost in the wilderness while being stalked by unseen enemies. Fear of the supernatural. Fear of old abandoned dwellings. This film deftly presses on these pressure points, and the result is a fairly frightening movie. The amateurish cast adds a bit of realism to the story, and is the reason for the big box office draw. The cadence of the story lacks consistency, but the last 5-10 minutes will have any but the most jaded horror fans on the end of their seats.

Without a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The writer could have written this screenplay in a few minutes without much thought at all but the PR work is what I find impressive.<br/><br/>The writer did not follow the rules of plot construction.  No one ever saw what was killing the students.  I've always been one to bend the rules but never to throw them away completely.  The audience should have some idea who the antagonist is somewhere in the first 15-20 min of the movie.  So they talk about the evil witch but no one ever sees her through the entire movie. Another general rule is the evil should be vanquished.  The worse the crime the worse the punishment otherwise there is no viewer satisfaction at the end of the movie.  The only people who were punished in this movie were the viewers who paid to see it.  A good movie should leave the viewer with some sense of satisfaction but this movie leaves the viewer with unresolved emotions. Like seeing the food but not being able to eat it.<br/><br/>Sometimes the writer instructor will ask students to write a bad movie screenplay so they can see why it doesn't work.  But the Blair Witch group wrote a bad movie script and through their PR proved it did work, at least once.  At some point in a student's life they like to prove their instructor wrong at least once.<br/><br/>I do admire the fact that a movie can be made for around $8,000 and bring in more than $140,000,000.  But it sends the wrong signal to producers all over the world telling them to buy bad movie scripts.  Believe me that's 90+% of what Hollywood is doing these days.<br/><br/>I could turn my kids and some of their friends loose in the woods with a video camera or two and I'm sure they could do at least as well if not better, without a script, than the Blair Witch cast and crew did with one. And I'll bet they could do it for around $1,000.  You might think this is all pretty amazing but have you checked to see there were a few attempts to get on the Blair Witch band wagon, producers trying to make look alikes and they failed big time.  Evidently the magic only worked once.  The people wised up and won't fall for Blair Witch type PR tricks again.  This tells you the majority of the people who saw it didn't like it and wouldn't do that again.<br/><br/>I'm glad the cast and crew of the Blair Witch project did well in their effort to fool the public.  I'm glad they made a great deal of money for a very little investment.  But to me the movie was a comedy not a horror movie. And it was poorly done. It takes a master PR person or someone with the gift to turn a looser like this into a winner but they did it with style.  If someone asks I will tell them ""Sure watch it.

The message then goes on to say that the group of filmakers dissapeared and have never been found.<br/><br/>What follows is a viewing of the ""footage"" they captured  before their dissapearance.<br/><br/>The result is a haunting tale filmed with a hanheld camera, disoriented motions, and the grim knowledge that these young adults are marching towards their doom.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project consists of very realistic acting and  a chilling first person naration through the eyes of the handheld camera. Now, I have seen many horror films that I can only describe as horrible and completly lacking in creativity. Many of them relie on violence and gore to make the audience overlook the terrible acting and very mediocre plot. I literally HATE these films and their filmmakers. However, in Blair Witch, there is no gore or sex, the language in understandable for people in this situation, and the film uses tension and a kind of claustrophobic feeling to frighten its audience.<br/><br/>However, this film can be very slow in some parts and I could pick out almost 15 minutes of superfluous screentime.

The teenagers make an interesting and compelling portrayal of their characters. I have always admired Heather Donahue and this serves to keep that high opinion in tact. Technically, the direction, filming and editing are well done, but not outstanding in any way.I love a good scare, when it's not accompanied by gratuitous gore. This fit the bill nicely. I look at it as fiction, despite the notice that it's based on true events, and it was an enjoyable fictional movie. Very, very creepy.A nice idea, and good execution of that idea make this a foreign film to see. The film does have a few cliche moments, but don't let that distract you from the film itself. It's very clever, very scary in bits, and the final twist is worth waiting for.<br/><br/>It just goes to show that a decent horror film can be made without all the blood and guts. I don't think it was better than Ring, but you can see some similarities. It's worth a look, and you never know, you might be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>And if you really can't be bothered to watch it, watch out for the Hollywood remake which will either be a total load of rubbish, or a good adaptation - probably the former!!<br/><br/>Some friends were ranting about how damn good The Blair Witch Project and its sequel were, so I rented the first one last night to see whether all the fuss was justified.<br/><br/>It was.<br/><br/>Bloody hell.

I can appreciate creepy moments and often feel mildly uneasy after watching a film, but never this level of fear. Oh, no. I had to sleep with the light on. What sort of fool am I? I guess because it's way more realistic than your average teen horror fare. This movie was pretty good, but the way it was filmed, it looked like someone just used a video camera, so the shakiness and zooms sort of distracted you from the film itself, which is indeed brilliance. This movie really captures that disturbing feel, and it doesn't skip showing the raw things. The actors are good. Good horror film. <br/><br/>The idea of a sort of going into the woods with a thing stalking you while taping it is rather American High School Horror Film, but The Blair Witch Project is so much more than that. It begins with a couple of teenagers in the uncomfortable (but brilliant) opening scene, then begins to concentrate on them.<br/><br/>The tension builds slowly -- helped along by the magnificent soundtrack and the sound effects of the video -- and things that happen often have no build-up. For example, if it was a Hollywood film then THAT spectacular bloody hand print scene would have been chock-full of intense music, building up to a crescendo. But was it? No, there was no sign that anything was going to happen. I mean, I had my suspicions but there was no build up. So, when it happened I jumped a good five feet into the air.<br/><br/>I thought that was it, but there was yet ANOTHER climax in which they see the bloody hand prints and hear the children laughing. That scene should go down in history as THE second (or third) creepiest film scene of all time. The bloodied hand prints, the children laughing, the witch stalking them and the cliche bad-always-moves-slowly-and-good-always-moves-quickly-yet-bad-always-gets-good thing to create a scene that I fear will never leave me alone. I feel stupid now in the bright morning sunshine, having to explain it to my sister. We've turned it back around, but don't think for one second that it'll stay that way when I go to bed.<br/><br/>I've turned off my phone. And I've forced my boyfriend to watch the film, and told him to show it to his mates.<br/><br/>Just in case.<br/><br/>

"Vafthrudnir","8","0","1","4 March 2004"," Buffs vs. Afficionados: A Blair Witch Defense
","A horror movie with less than an ounce of visible blood, where we never see or even learn beyond doubt what the ""killer"" is, and no teenage sex-kitten gets naked. That this movie has suffered vociferous opposition hardly surprises me. The simple fact is, it's extremely good, and the horror-movie industry will hardly suffer quality without a fight. Friends, the whole problem is that there are two species of us who watch horror movies. There are horror ""buffs"", who seek all the wrong things in movies. Gore, nudity, and triteness are the hallmark of the horror buff's tastes. They feel that ""horror"" comes from making an audience jump, as if the movie-maker's art were as simple as a well-timed M-80 in a quiet classroom, and prize ""fun"" over shivers. Then there are those other, rarer fans, the true horror ""afficionados"". We are the audience who, for whatever reason, enjoy being scared. Of a higher stripe than your rank-and-file ""buff"", we look for a movie to be creepy, disturbing, unsettling. We seek a smarter approach. Not that it must always be subtle; I have little doubt that The Exorcist approaches the top of most ""afficionado's"" lists. But, friends, there is true horror here, as opposed to your common slasher, which is targeted to audiences possessing the human sensitivity of a tombstone. The Blair Witch is the afficionado's dream. It achieves a level of absolute verisimilitude that makes suspension of disbelief almost *too* easy. By presenting itself as an ""artifact"", it takes itself out of the Land of Make Believe and intrudes itself (delightfully) into the viewer's world. The much-bemoaned dialogue is unsettling because it's *not* movie-dialogue at all; it's actually the way people in the really-for-real world speak. The piles of stone and strange twists in the trees are never really explained, nor should they be; we don't know what they are, but they appear tantalizingly realistic, mysterious and yet perfectly plausible; you could easily imagine that the whatever-is-out-there might leave signs exactly like that. And those wierd things in the branches do very much seem like they have a kind of wierd internal logic, like they *should* mean something. If it's never revealed, well, that's the magic of tease and misdirection, two of the most powerful weapons in the *real* horror-movie's arsenal. I'll concede, the movie was a fluke, and its gimmick can probably never be reproduced well without lapsing into imitation. But, to my mind, this what seperates ""us"" from ""them"". If the Blair Witch scared the livin' bejesus out of you, you have the imaginative engagement necessary for appreciation of the world's finest horror-movies. If not... go rent Freddy vs. Jason, little horror ""buff""."

","I have seen the movie 3 times, although i must admit that the original scare that exist after watching it the first time was subdued. Nevertheless this is truly a good movie for all its worth. Hollywood has spoilt a lot of people in scare tactic movies with special effects and gore. Being fearful of the unknown is what makes this movie shines. Viewers who were disappointed are usually people who are skeptic about the unknown and fear....but let me put you in a senereo suppose you were in the woods of the blair witch and you know she exist because you have heard stories about her and you are trying to get to a certain destination in the woods but somehow just cannot get there  (something like a twilight zone phenomena)you then become scared because you know after walking so long you end up at the same spot you began ....that would definately freak the hell out of me. Nightfall is approuching and you start to hear weird sounds and some weird tree designs and your imagination start running like crazy. This is what fear is all about.Those people who know about the great Alfred Hitchcock movies can relate to such suspense and fear. I would not even classify it as a horror movie its more of a suspense scary thriller very unique in its own way. Watch this movie by yourself in a dark room at night and i guarantee you will be thinking twice to turn the lights on. Forget about hollywood and the so called slasher movies that serves up everything on a platter the blair witch project is an artistic movie done in a creative way as a true documentary to smartly instill fear for those who wish to close their eyes and imaging."

Some of the noises in the film were very reminiscent of those I had heard. So, that got me going right there. I was a captive audience and was having flashbacks throughout the film.<br/><br/>The acting seemed very convincing to me. Like, HEY! I know people like this! Very real portrayals. You can, if you let yourself, become one of the gang - a quiet partner on the trip, so to speak.<br/><br/>The camera work should require Dramamine. If you are prone to motion sickness - this film will do it. It isn't so bad on the small screen though. Nonetheless, for what the intent is in this film - the camera work is very appropriate. Once again you can feel like one of the gang running your a** off.<br/><br/>Naturally there is no music. Nor should there be.<br/><br/>I believe the lighting is all it should have been as well.<br/><br/>Now for the chill factor....I was fascinated and began to freak a bit the first time I saw this...I admit. I thought the story was very plausible. Who knows what's really out in those woods. You're never really sure even when it reveals itself.  <br/><br/>Oddly enough, as much as I liked it the first time, it lost ground the second time through. In fact, I may not feel like watching it again for a while. I must admit - some of what people complain about in this film was more apparent the second time through. But I wasn't 'caught up' in my imagination the second time through. But that's the key here, folks. If you can put yourself there - it can be rather effective.<br/><br/>The story and the whole PR idea itself is really quite good though.

The film has a simple premise of a group of 20 somethings investigating a legendary witch's hangout,  but it is executed divinely.  Viewers who think the film is boring probably like lots of special effects and camera wizardly -- if so, then that is their source of disappointment.  The film could have existed 75 years ago and relies more on scaring viewers with our own imaginations.

"chconnol","Null","0","1","14 November 2003"," Flawed Masterpiece
","A flawed masterpiece of psychological suspense, ""The Blair Witch Project"" nevertheless is fascinating and truly frightening in several sequences.  It works thanks to it's simplicity.  Contrast this movie with ""Poltergeist"" in which Spielberg loaded on so many overt special effects that anything truly frightening was subverted. (Don't write back saying the Steven Spielberg didn't direct ""Poltergeist"" that it was Tobe Hooper.  The story is that Hooper lost his mind making it and Spielberg stepped in and directed the bulk of the movie.) In ""The Blair Witch Project"" virtually nothing is seen. It's all inferred like the feeling one gets walking into a dark room (or basement).  Yes, some of it doesn't really make sense.  For example, why would the three of them keep filming when they felt or knew they were doomed?  Obviously, without that, there'd be no film.  If you've ever camped out in a rural area or the deep woods, the feeling the film gives you is 100% correct.  A great BOO movie.  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: How and where you see this movie is important.  I saw it in a movie theater and the effect was amazing.  People were screaming and the darkness definately helped the effects.  Other people I know saw this movie at home with the lights fully on.  They didn't ""get it"" at all.  It's like the first time I saw ""Carnival of Souls"".  I watched on a sunny, Saturday afternoon.  No effect.  Two or three years later, I catch it late on a Sunday night (around 11:30 PM). Scared the Hell outta me.  Gave me the creeps.  Atmosphere is important for horror-thrillers like these."

Any other way of constructing the story and the individual sequences would have, at the very least, watered down the fright factor a bit.<br/><br/>I must say I was surprised by how genuinely creeped out I was at times when viewing this film - mostly due to the glaring lack of clichéd musical cues and ambient noise. I felt that was the absolute strongest aspect of ""The Blair Witch Project"", a raw, unpleasant journey into the woods captured on film by three young ""filmmakers"" who somehow ""disappeared"" as their ""documentary"" was being shot. Losing the map, fighting amongst companions, the discovery of random odd signs in the woods - most notably the film's trademark stick symbols - and more all serve to heighten the unbelievable realism of this infamous voyeuristic drama. I feel it deserves its cult status as one of the greatest and most original horror films ever made. It's obvious why many people saw such potential for imitation and mockery (mostly just for that signature ""I'm so scared"" teary-eyed Heather close-up). ""The Blair Witch Project"", however, cannot be called such a disaster. It's certainly a unique viewing experience, and for that I must commend it for its approach, and its lasting legacy."

But you have to give it credit where it's due.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie when it first came out was brilliantly executed. The way they cast unknown actors, how they tied it in to a documentary on the Discovery Channel (without ever saying it was just a movie), the way they tied it in to urban legends and websites before the movie was even released, made it seem so ""real"". People really wondered for a while what was real and what wasn't.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie doesn't have a monster like Leatherface or Freddy, it's mostly about three losers freaking out while lost in the forest. But it was an astoundingly unique bit of movie-making, almost entirely improvized, the actors were given their own cameras and sent away to film themselves. There was no set, and already any crew! Do we really need chainsaws sawing off pretty girls' heads to make a movie creepy?<br/><br/>The film is best from Josh's disapperance to the end, and especially the last 5 minutes are spooky enough to make up for the more boring bits in the middle. I mean who has watched it and not truly wondered what happened in that last 1 minute?<br/><br/>Shame on those who gave this film a ""0"", not to recognize what a unique, creepy, innovative film this was.

The early night shots, when they are hearing weird sounds in the dark, made me think, 'well, there's lots of animals that move around in the night; roll over and get some sleep.'  I think the horror really set in, for me, after Josh disappears and we hear his screams in the distance . . . I couldn't help wondering what was happening to him to make him scream.  I wanted to know, but I didn't want to know.  The next morning, we discover his bloody tooth.  Now we know we're in 'indian territory,' and these people aren't anywhere close to being equipped to deal with it, mentally or physically.

Everyone I had talked to who had seen it said that is had scared them sh**-less.  I consider myself a true horror buff who has seen almost everything, even the stuff in the enormous 80s video cassette holders at the local rinky-dink video stores.  So you can imagine my anticipation.  If I wasn't going to wet myself from fright, I was sure to wet myself from excitement.  Finally, I was able to see the movie that everyone was spitting cuds into my face about.  For the most part, it started off original.  Hey, a first person/handheld shot of what is going on in the movie.  Okay, this is unique.  Then the Legend of the Blair Witch seemed really cool.  But as the movie dragged on (and I felt as if I might upchuck from motion sickness) it just really seemed like the Real World Goes Camping.  There was arguing and confusion as our three students lost their way in the woods. Then they would get spooked at night by the sounds of children laughing and some left over sticks in the morning.  Oooooo, I'm shaking already!  Nothing scarier than children and bundled sticks.  Then one of the students disappears from the others. The other two run out of their tent and scream ""What the hell is that!  What the hell is that!""  Well, as the viewer, if I could even get a glimpse of ""that"" I might be able to tell you what is was.  Perhaps it was an owl, or a tree frog.  I don't know.  What am I supposed to be scared of here?  Finally, to my stomach's pleasing we come to the climax of the film, where our film students enter what appears to be The Blair Witch's shack. Finally, I'm thinking I'm going to see something, right?  WRONG!  Nothing. No shadow, nor glimpse of who the ""Blair Witch"" may be.  We are left wondering, if there really was a Blair Witch, or if the missing student, Josh, was the ""Blair Witch.""  Perhaps a clever little whodunnit, but not even close to scary.  Not to mention, I prefer a score to my horror movies. It adds so much atmosphere (take Halloween for instance).  I also prefer to see at least a glimpse of the killer or the evil or whatever it is that makes this a ""horror"" movie.  Perhaps the two clowns who did this film couldn't afford to have a monster.  Well, now they can after taking all of us suckers to the cleaners.  And for all those nincompoops who thought that this movie was for real, the short bus will be around shortly to pick you up.  Well, I hope this review shows you that this movie is a total waste of time, money, and anticipation for horror fans.  What seemed like an original idea turned into a total sham?  When I finish watching a horror movie, I want the fright to stay with me, such as when I go into the woods, I think Jason Vorhees, or if I go to a cemetery, I think Tall Man.  When I think of Blair Witch, I think of...hmmm...what was I supposed to be scared of?  The wind?"

","I just revisited Blair Witch and it remains among the top 2 or 3 scariest films I've ever seen, possibly number one. It works on a psychological level that can't be compared to ""traditional"" horror attempts. If you find yourself ""trying"" to get into it, you're probably wasting your time.<br/><br/>I think this movie is best watched alone on TV at night, or with a small crowd that won't interrupt with banal comments. In fact, I don't think you should talk at all during this film because so much of it relies on ""being there"" and staying there until the end.<br/><br/>I think many people are too shallow or short on patience to get drawn into it, and that accounts for most of the negative reviews. They are simply not describing the same experience had by those who got into it. For me, that happened shortly after the interviews with the townspeople, especially the one with the strange lady at the trailer park. When this film works on someone, it becomes reality, and reality can be overwhelming if you're lost in the woods and the sun is sinking. <br/><br/>Negative reviewers try to dissect it with criticisms of the plot and pacing that have no bearing on how it works for a receptive mind. It doesn't need a traditional plot or special effects because it wasn't meant to work on an in-yo-face level. Notice how short some of the bad reviews are? It's as if they were told to hate it and just want to join the fray. Many probably saw it in a big, sarcastic crowd that prevented them from reaching the trance-state that creates so much of the tension.<br/><br/>It's too bad I'm defending this film by attacking the personalities of its detractors, but I'm afraid that's necessary! To sum it up, if your main musical fare is Hip Hop or Britney Spears you'll probably find Blair Witch dull. But if you can sit still and enjoy slow classical or ambient soundscapes you may find yourself mesmerized. Flaky viewers (or those who'd never understand their own flakiness) need not apply."

What really blew me away was the IDEA of The Blair Witch Project.  <br/><br/>
The idea for this movie was fresh and interesting.  1st person video/film, with a simple cast and spontaneous dialogue.  They get into some trouble, and as their situation worsens, they cope with it as humans would.  Suspense is high, as is empathy for the characters.  The emotions they produce for the camera are as real as they need to be.<br/><br/>
For movie-goers suffering under the yoke of such intellectual midgets/hollywood heavyweights as Jerry Bruckheimer/James Cameron, I think this just what was needed; a bunch of rookies who go out and spend about $20,000 and make one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>
Warning:  for people who are big fans of the above-mentioned dough-heads, your attention span is probably way too short already.  Don't both with Blair Witch.  This is a movie for those who still wish to be challenged by the cinematic medium.  It's no insult to the film for me to say it was a difficult movie to watch.  But it was worth it."

","I was genuinely looking forward to this one. The buzz had been circulating for months  ever since patrons had run out of screenings for it at the Sundance Festival that year.<br/><br/>By the time it was finally released in the UK I guess there was such a wave of hyper following it, that it was almost certain to be a disappointment and unfortunately it was  very much so.<br/><br/>I love psychological horror as much as anyone and whilst enjoying my fair share of gore and effects driven films, can certainly appreciate that often the most scariest of things happen in the mind, not in what you see on the screen. <br/><br/>The trouble with this film is that it didn't really show anything  it wasn't creepy or frightening, just monotonous. It had a few brief moments which created shivers, but not many. It's a great shame because the whole concept is excellent and the myth of the Blair Witch' is quite frightening. This film just never delivered. It needed something more than what it had.<br/><br/>
A missed opportunity and certainly NOT the new Exorcist', despite such claims at the time of release."

","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>This movie was pretty awful.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, I was wondering exactly what the filmmakers were expecting me to be feeling.  Should I have been feeling empathetic, anxious, fearful, horrified?  None of those were part of the experience.  First I was bored, then annoyed, then really annoyed, then angry.<br/><br/>This movie sets out to do what only a real genius can accomplish in a horror movie:  causing fear without ever presenting the source of that fear on-screen.  These filmmakers weren't geniuses.<br/><br/>The characters spent most of their time on-screen screaming at each other. This, in addition to the awful camera work and the black and white (mostly black) scenery made it a very unpleasant movie to watch, even for a horror flick.  Also, the scenes are set in Maryland.  I like the way Dave Barry put it when he said, ""You get the impression that if they'd just shut up and WALK, in 20 minutes they'd come to a Wal-Mart.""<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is the last couple of seconds before the credits roll -- there is no screaming, and the camera is still.  During the few minutes before this point, you're getting ready to either (1) see something cool, or (2) leave the theater.<br/><br/>I imagine that if you really really wanted to be afraid, this movie could probably help you out.  But mostly it will just scare young grammar-school-age kids that still have the ""monster under my bed at night"" kind of phobias.<br/><br/>This movie could have had lots of potential.

Too many horror movies today rely on tired conventions; it's nice to see a movie that dares to be different.<br/><br/>You can't compare that movie to, or place it in the same catagory as, ones like The Exorist or Psycho. Those movies were made in a very conventional style, using tools like music and camera movement to create fear and terror. Blair Witch had no background music and no camera technique to do its work. And it didn't have a pay-off at the end. For most people, it was just too experimental. For me, that was precisely why I liked it."

","Now it is my turn to roll up the sleeves.  THIS SUCKED!!! A perfect example of the current trend in moviemaking:  THE LOST OPPORTUNITY.  What really bugged me (besides Lady Heather, the latest has been) about this pretentious mess was that it initially had a strong, promising IDEA, then gallently set out to destroy it.  (Does anyone recall REIGN OF FIRE?).<br/><br/>Sure, the IDEA of the unseen menace can be compelling and even inevitably scary, BUT this class room assignment was in the wanna be mitts of the clueless.  I won t hark on all the structural flaws, for I prefer not to bore you with common knowledge.  If I was in their predicament (which was all their own stupid doing:  BAD WRITING!), I might have uttered a few F words, but I would have bored myself after a number of seconds, and then would have followed that stream and pay note to the position of the sun and when & where it sets.  Ever been a scout?  (I would have also brained that jerk who lost the map, but that's another story).  I'll even overlook the no-cell phone motif.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, this non-entity is so ""subtle"" that the most incredible thing happens:  NOTHING!  I do like subtlety in suspense and horror, but the tension has to keep consistently mounting in order for it to create the shocks and scares.  Obviously, the makers never saw a Hitchcock film.  Two true classic horror films, CURSE OF THE DEMON and THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN effectively achieved these crucial means by keeping the monsters off screen, but you could always sense their lurking presense slowly closing in and entrapping you, AND they did finally reveal something and delivered brilliant stories that really shocked and left you wondering later.  Both horror gems are highly recommended.<br/><br/>Too bad that THE BORING WITCH didn't know how to run with the big ball. Ideas are like notes, if they are not effectively strung together, then the song will not rock.  Back to FILM 101 boys and annoying girls.<br/><br/>Both admirers and detractors should read the short story, ""The Wendigo"" (and I don't mean that disappointingly insulting film ""adaptation"") by Algernon Blackwood, for that was actually the scary story that these clowns beautifully ruined.  (Now, THAT is a true horror tale).  It was about two hunters in the northern Canadian woods who are plagued by an unseen legendary forest demon.  Does it really exist or are they flipping out from their isolation and fear?  That was the film that should have been made, BUT NOT BY THESE DISPOSABLE JERKS!<br/><br/>MORAL  Never get too uptight over a bundle of sticks."
"Mr Parker","Null","0","1","11 July 2003"," The ShakyCam Project
","I'll tell you what I find sad: when something gets hyped to the point where there's just no way that it can ever live up to people's expectations. I remember reading a quote somewhere saying that this movie was scarier than the Exorcist. If I hadn't already seen the movie at that point, I would've been pretty disappointed had I gone to see it with this quote in mind. I personally believe that I will not see a film scarier than the Exorcist during my lifetime. At the time of this writing, I am twenty-eight years old. The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time in my opinion and this film, chilling as it can be at points, comes nowhere near first place. I feel the need to express this because so many people that I know have watched this thinking they were about to get the very life scared out of them, only to walk away shaking their heads in disgust. I happen to think that while it's not the greatest horror movie in the world, nor is it a great movie, period, as a whole I have to give it a good write-up because let's face it, the filmmakers took a good idea and ran with it. The way that this film was done and marketed is the kind of thing that makes one ask themselves, ""Now, why didn't I come up with that idea?"". You're probably familiar with the story behind it already but if you're not, here it is: three young filmmakers head out to the woods as part of their research project on an old legend revolving around the Blair Witch and mysteriously disappear. The movie you watch is supposed to be the actual footage they filmed while stuck in the forest, found a year later. It's shot entirely with a camcorder and a black and white 16mm camera held by any of the three main characters. Those who get motion sickness easily may want to avoid this entirely because there are scenes in the film where the shots go all over the place in that sickening way that camcorders tend to produce more than regular film does. The whole idea is to give it a pseudo-documentary feel and I think it works well for the most part. There was this whole marketing craze where they didn't tell anyone that the whole thing was a fake and they actually pulled it off to some extent, even going so far as to have a website dedicated to the mystery of the Blair Witch and the strange revelations that emerged from the search team's findings. When I saw this in the theaters, a girl outside was crying about how sad it was that they never found the three kids. She bought the whole thing obviously. I read up on movies a lot so I didn't fall for it because I knew about the whole myth thing beforehand. At any rate, I found the movie to be generally unsettling. The acting is acceptable but seems forced on occasion. It's my understanding that they were given a rough approximation of what kind of performance they were to give in note form so maybe it stems from that. There are some pretty creepy moments in this film and if you've ever been camping in the middle of a dark forest, you know exactly how scary this movie can be at times. If you have to see this movie, watch it for the end sequence which in my opinion is one of the most frightening scenes in any movie I have ever seen. Watch it under the right conditions: dark lights, night time, quiet setting. I guarantee that if you watch this with no huge expectations, you will be satisfied. <br/><br/>RATING:***1/2 out of *****, a half a star thrown in for a genuine attempt at giving us something we haven't seen before and doing it with a bare amount of materials at their disposal."

","After intending to see this one for years, I finally did. What had put me off before were all the horror stories-not of witches, but of people running out of the theatre to puke, due to the jerky camera movements. As it turns out, I probably wouldn't have noticed this at all, had I not been looking for it. (Note: I now see, on an IMDb link that this same factor apparently didn't carry over very badly onto video.)<br/><br/>What I did find was an intriguingly simple tale of horror. I assume most earthlings know the basic plot-as I have for years before seeing it: Three college (I assume) students making a class documentary on a supposedly haunted woods near a small Maryland town disappear, their video footage being found a year later. I have heard people berate this as being as simply and cheaply made as the type of school documentary it portrays. Some have called it a total waste of time. I fail to grasp their viewpoint.<br/><br/>Actually there was a fair amount I did NOT know about the movie-even after watching it. (Thank goodness for the IMDb!) I admit I was a tad freaked out when I saw that the actors all played characters with their own names. Also surprising was that virtually the entire dialogue was adlibbed and that the three cast members knew very little of what was going to be happening to them. It was more a case of improvising and reacting than true acting. Yet it worked marvelously. (I enjoyed the note that Heather Donahue supposedly carried a knife with her out of concern for sharing a tent with two strange guys.) I had always laughed at the `stupid kids' who spread rumors that this was a REAL documentary. Now I see that the producers actually claimed it WAS real when it was first promoted! (Hence, I suppose, the reason for using the actors' real names.)<br/><br/>Certainly the movie awoke Hollywood to a realization that big budget, CGI and multi-million dollar directors are not always the answer when seeking a crowd-pleaser. Eeriness, tension, pathos and a good story are all put together for basically the equivalent of a year's salary for many of us. Less was definitely more for Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez and Gregg Hale and his castaways."

","Sometimes I can't help but believe that people who claim that this film is ""not scary at all"" are really just resentful of how boldly the makers of the film broke the rules. Not ever seeing the evil in a film is much more shocking than any visible form that evil could take. I believe that an attempt to show us the Blair Witch, regardless of how inventive and disturbing this portrayal would have been, would have hurt the film. The makers of The Blair Witch Project rely on the imagination of the viewer to contribute to the true horror of the film. Is it presumptuous of me to suggest that those who don't find this movie frightening lack the insides that make real fear possible?<br/><br/>Another complaint I don't understand is that the acting is bad; I thought the performances were excellent. The Heather Donahue monologue that imbeciles have been so eager to parody is astounding.

"ES-III","Null","0","1","5 June 2003"," A letdown of major proportions in amateur film-making!
","I was so damned excited to see this film when I first heard about its premise - three film-students go out in the middle of nowhere in search of a local myth, and never return, though their film footage resurfaces a year or so later.  And while I'll probably be crucified or burned at the stake for saying it, I certainly don't see what all the hubbub is about! I come from a pretty decent film background, and have viewed plenty of student-work that's both similar and superior!  So, first, I have to ask -- what's the attraction?  Three people get lost in the woods while making a documentary on a local legend and eventually die, making this what some people are calling `the scariest film ever.'  I don't think so. `The Blair Witch Project' (great title, by the way) is filmed in the documentary style, yet it divulges the whole scam prior (that the film is staged), making me wonder how viewers can insert themselves into the characters' dilemma or feel any of their pain and anguish.  I agree that the fear of the unknown is oftentimes the spookiest, but if you're in on the joke, then it's known (and therefore invalid).  I wish that the truth of the filming would have been kept a secret; that the directors and company would have kept their mouths shut and let the media-ball continue to roll - then, and only then, would `The Blair Witch Project' have been scary.  Sure, you could fire right back, saying a documentary that encompasses fiction is every bit as justifiable as `Halloween' or `The Shining,' but then again, those two films had genuine stories and backgrounds - nothing ever happens in this film that justifies fear. I understand the directors' intent to reveal real fear, rather than produce digitally-effected monsters that spew blood and goo from their eyes and noses -- and I think it's true that the human imagination conjures up plenty of s**t scarier than any three Stephen King books -- but put a real ski-mask-clad chainsaw-wielding half-breed in the woods with these three characters (in actuality), and watch how quickly their lost-in-the-woods scenario and mysterious pagan stick-figures become secondary.  Hey, Marlon Perkins' Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom specials are real and rousing, but they're not really scaring the pants off of anyone, y'know? Secondly, though to a lesser degree, the movie is pretty poorly made (a fact acknowledged by the film-makers), due to a lack of budget.  And while I celebrate the crew's resourcefulness, the hokum is nonetheless still present (does the fact that you're shooting in a documentary style vindicate amateur film-making?  Only future directing jaunts from Myrick and Sánchez can answer that one).  Still, there are a lot of good scenes: Heather's self-filmed confession (completed when she runs out of faith) is unsettling, and some of the locals' stories are just great.  Plus, the creepy ending is pure art no matter where or how it was shot.  And not to be overlooked, the crude bundles of twigs and unsettling stick figures actually look like they were created by a Wicca-starved witch or hermit. Sure, there was a mini `Blair Witch' craze that swept through the American underground, but I'll still take `The Sentinel,' `The Shining' and `The Exorcist' any day!"

","When I first saw the previews for this movie, I didn't really know what to think, but I saw the website address flashed and decided to check it out. The website alone intrigued me and I really wanted to see this movie.  I still tried to go in without a lot of expectations...I hate spoiling a movie based on what I THINK it should be.  I'm glad I was able to do that since I ended up really enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>Sure, there are some drawbacks to it:  the annoying Heather who can't stop screaming at everyone, the overuse of cuss words (but hey, they're college kids..I know I heard a LOT of that in college, so it really only added to the overall ""realness"" of it), and the unsteady camera work.  However, the unsteady camera movements I was able to deal with through its integration in the believability of the story of AMATEUR film makers out to explore the legend of the blair witch.  Anyone who makes home movies knows it can be difficult to keep a steady cam...especially when walking/running through the woods.  So, like I said, this really didn't detract too much from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Now, all that negativity aside, I absolutely loved this movie.  The way it was done was so entirely different from the typical horror/slasher/thriller/etc movies.  Blair Witch was filmed as actual footage with little to no script whatsoever.  The storyline is slowly built up through interviews and conversations, allowing the viewer to get an idea of what is going on and what the young film makers are out to accomplish.  Once we are armed with this knowledge, creepy little inferences are made here and there building a nervousness that culminates in the final scenes.  It is incredible. <br/><br/>
I remember camping out in the woods of my backyard and fearing every little twig snap or the slightest sound.  Blair Witch brought me right back into those days.  Also, it was able to create a fear in me without having to hold my hand through the entire movie, and instead, letting my imagination run wild.  The best part being that fears were built withought ever having to really be shown anything.  All too often in movies the fear is lost once a film maker tries to show us what the ""monster"" or ""thing"" looks like...it just can't compare to what our mind's eye can depict.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Blair Witch an 8 out of 10 stars.  If you can get past the sometimes nausea inducing camera work, you may find this is quite an interesting movie."

","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is one of those films that made history by shooting to the top of the box office while being made on a very paltry budget of just $40,000.  It also benefitted from all the hype surrounding its story of a group of teens who venture into the desolate Maryland woods to find out if the legend of the Blair Witch is fact or fiction.  As a result, this film went on to gross $130 million during the late summer of 1999.<br/><br/>But while the premise of the story and the inventive ""Shaky-Cam"" work of the filmmakers suggest a very chilling and suspenseful film, I am only able to give this film a '6' rating out of 10.<br/><br/>The reason?  Even for $40,000, you think it would be easier for filmmakers Eduardo Myrick and Daniel Sanchez to come up with a better use of dialogue than you'd get in an average teen-slasher pic.  The pacing of the film is unquestionably inventive, and the atmosphere, the further the teens venture into the woods, begins to resemble John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE. The stick figures used as the signs of the Blair Witch's presence (the witch herself, in a thoroughly brilliant move, is never, ever seen) are also good; and the lack of explicit gore is quite refreshing.  But the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it gets tired after a while.  It is worse than any of the screaming done by the film's lead heroine (Heather Donahue) or her ""I'm-so-scared""-by flashlight scene.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of people, I wouldn't call THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT an overhyped low-budget disaster; in terms of premise, it more than lives up to the hype. Even the acting of this amateur group is worth sitting through.  But unlike others, because of the dialogue (the one and ONLY reason this film has its 'R' rating at all), I can't quite call it a masterpiece.  Still, it is a worthy film, if frustratingly uneven."

Hiring three no-name actors to play the parts was a brilliant way to dupe people into thinking this was a true event, and their acting was phenomenal. Not a bit of faked angst or anger. It was all real. Except for the fact that Heather the main character holds onto her camera while trying to kick the crap out of Mike for getting them further lost in the woods. I think she would have put the camera down or something. Oh well.<br/><br/>The movie's scariest point is its Hitchcockian style of not showing you what's out there. Too often in scary movies they try to TELL you what's scary by having a guy in a black cloak with a skewed mask chase after people with a knife. That doesn't do anything for me, he just looks stupid. The real fear is the fear of the unknown. When you cannot SEE what is out there, your imagination runs wild and you imagine the worst. That coupled with the confusing and disturbing final footage of the film crew examining an old abandoned cottage with disturbing findings all over the walls, ending with the cameras falling violently to the ground and uncertainty as to what happened to the film crew, and who it was that was doing all that screaming around them, made this a truly terrifying experience.<br/><br/>To add to the terror I felt, after watching this, I walked upstairs to find all the lights off and the front door open, and nobody there, and I armed myself with a kendo stick for the rest of the night."

","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is all about effect. It's the kind of movie best enjoyed on the first viewing, like THE RING or MEMENTO; analyze it to heavily and you ruin some of the thrills. The concept of a completely staged documentary is, of course, not new. The best example, and the one that BLAIR WITCH most resembles, is an excellent French film called MAN BITES DOG; the latter is a much better film, but BLAIR WITCH pulls off its premise more realistically than any other ""mockumentary"" I've ever seen. Talented but completely unknown actors man the cameras and much of the sound effects throughout the film, while simultaneously remaining in character enough to improvise as each new terror is presented to them. Of course, they knew it was all staged, but the verisimilitude achieved in the film cannot be denied. Shooting in ""real time"" and actually depriving the actors of food and rest, as well as scripted lines and any cognizance of plot direction, it is easy to see how writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez managed to perpetrate this ingenious hoax to the point where audiences were actually terrified. This is a very realistic, ominous and visceral film."

But in my way home, chatting about it with my boyfriend, I finally understood the end of the movie, and I came out in goose flesh. So I think is a good horror film, in the line of Ringu.

","""The Blair Witch Project"" was an interesting idea, and it's easy to admire the ingenuity of the filmmakers and their little experiment.<br/><br/>
Sadly, the film is ALMOST as scary as a particularly good segment on ""The Simpson's Treehouse of Horror"", and offers practically no entertainment value. The improvised dialogue is witless and unimaginative, and the shaky hand-held camera work would give Michael Bay motion sickness. The performances are inconsistent, thought Heather Donahue's believable work is the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot stress clearly enough that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is just not scary. At all. In any way, shape or form. It is, unfortunately, an excercise in sheer boredom."

I live upstairs of a condo with only two floors, hadn't heard any voices from downstairs and had the feeling the wall neighbours had gone out too, so I felt rather lonely. Before startin to watch the film I said to myself that I can manage without seeing it, I had anyway all kinds of things to do, a harmonious home-evening. But once I had started to watch it I couldn't stop. There I was again, in a same situation as years ago with Michael Mann's ""Psychopath"" (can't remember the correct name). The film's atmosphere thickened and thickened and I had to see it till the end (or so I thought). BUT...the last 5 or 7 minutes came in that terrible, evil house and at the point when the girl was screaming: MIKE, MIKE... I turned the TV off. I just didn't want to see some awful mutilated body or some loose head hangin from the ceiling. The other night I had seen nightmares and felt ill  so the timing of this film was a bit wrong. Next day the first thing I did was to call my sister to tell how it ended.<br/><br/>I think the film is exceptionally well made considering many details. Personally I knew in the beginning it was not a document and in the very beginning of the film I was a bit irritated by the way the video camera was ""handled"" by a ""clumsy"" filmstudent, I thought it too obvious, like a fake to MAKE people believe it's a document which, I thought, possibly would have made me suspicious if I had watched it not knowing it was not one.

","There is an ""IQ floor"" below which viewers are simply not intellectually equipped to appreciate this movie.  Required for enjoyment of The Blair Witch Project is what ee cummings called ""the suspension of disbelief"": i.e. you must disregard the fact that you know this movie is a product of the motion picture industry and view it as if you really believe that it is actually the recovered footage of missing film students.  But, as I said, some lack the intellectual agility to accomplish such a feat, and, consequently, can not enjoy this movie as it was designed to be.<br/><br/>Another factor that contributes to the negative reviews is that modern American movie viewers have been spoiled by the non-stop razzle-dazzle of what are now all-too-common special effects.

","Here at last is a film that can with all justification wear the mantle horror, in its richest sense.  Gone are the axe murderers and green vomit spitting demon possessed, gone are all the bug eyed monsters and even the more sympathetic ones. At the same time, we recognize in Heather's character Victor Frankenstien's obsession, i.e., the hubris that leads us all into the woods when we're not absolutely sure where we're going.  That's the dilemma of the human experience, and that's why Blair Witch works for so many of us, I think.  We all make Heather's error a hundred times or more in our lives, and we drag people along who either don't know how to fend for themselves or actually can't.  And that's when the heartache begins, as the old song goes, because the way out isn't clearly marked.  And while the woods may not be as filled with tigers as they seem and the world may not hate us, the tigers are still chewing bones, and the world does not exactly love us, either. As for the controversial camera work, it's pretty clever to create a plot wherein whatever the camera does is basically going to be correct.  These are student film makers, right?  At the same time, to those who believe the actual film makers got sloppy, please check out the more recent editions of the film with the outtakes, a couple of which are genuinely wretched. No, a lot of serious thought beyond just marketing went into this piece. My favorite scene in the film is when Heather, exasperated, insists that people don't get lost in America.  Right behind this, Michael and Josh begin singing ""the Star Spangled Banner"" and ""America the Beautiful"".  Whether it was intended or not, the film makers comment that people do get lost in America, and they don't have to be in the woods either.<br/><br/>All in all, the film is a fine piece of psychological horror and a decent outing for the actual film makers, Sanchez and Myrick.  Clearly there's always room for improvment, but I don't know if it's in any of the areas (""Genuinely scary films like the Exorcist or the Shining"") some people are suggesting.  I'm of the opinion that this one stands up all by itself, in a way that most films people call ""scary"" seldom can.  It displays a little confidence in the imagination, not only in the imagination  of the audience, but in the imagination of its cast. That's a rare achievement in these days when most American film makers use special effects as a crutch.  I think the Blair Witch Project is one of those films that lends the horror genre some much needed credibility, and all kudoes go to Sanchez and Myrick."

","The Blair Witch Project can be considered a text-book example of 'forward-deployment' marketing, rather than a great film, which it is not. I may be blasted for saying this - but this movie wasn't scary. Not even a little, it wasn't even suspenceful. Proponents praise such things as 'creepiness', but I can think of numerous other films with better examples of this, notably 'Jacob's Ladder'. It was however a brilliant sell to the public, the genius in the marketing was in alluding that the story might be true. I'll admit that was what originally intrigued me. In this sense, we have all been 'had'. Perhaps those fans of the movie know this deep inside and are in denial, trying to validate their praise by looking for something deeper."

","I thought that this film worked extremely well on the first viewing (though in subsequent screenings the impact tends to diminish.)  To fully appreciate this movie you have to suspend a little of your disbelief, though not much, and put yourself in their shoes as you watch it.  One of the other comments mentioned how each night gets just a tiny bit worse, with the dread increasing as the sun got lower in the trees, and that was one of my strongest impressions as well.  All you need to let BWP creep you out is a modicum of imagination.  Most modern horror films rely more on gore and special effects than on genuine suspense, and it was really refreshing to see a movie where you NEVER see the evil.<br/><br/>The odd thing, though, is that the film takes about 12 hours to sink in. I went to see it with my brother and his girlfriend, and we all three walked out of the theater somewhat underwhelmed.  We hadn't considered it to be white-knuckle scary at any time.  (My brother's girlfriend did make her cat get out of the corner of the living room when she got home, though!) But by midmorning of the next day I couldn't get the movie out of my head - it had corkscrewed its way up my spine and wrapped around my brainstem overnight.  It was MUCH scarier that following morning.  The scene where the voodoo-type setup was found struck me the next day as particularly creepy and disturbing (I think that scene was more effective because it used the simple material that could be found anywhere in the forest.  The transferrence of horror and dread onto simple sticks and rocks was one of the things I really liked about the movie.)  BWP stayed with me for a good week.  They should never have made a sequel, though, especially one that relied on elements of stock Hollywood horror films.  But I guess it's hard to catch lightning in a bottle twice..."

Come on now, whatever happened to indulging your sense of horror and fright with lots of suspense, creepy atmosphere, weird and unsettling goings on - in other words, just plain using your imagination?<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good blood-and-gore splatter-flick with the best of 'em, but I'm not one of those people who necessarily has to have his horror handed to him on a blood-spattered silver platter. Often times it's more effective to have a spooky story told to you using little more than basic story-telling techniques. And that's what I like about this film, it is virtually devoid of splashy effects - it makes you work for your dinner instead of just handing it to you for free.<br/><br/>The one scene where they woke up to find weird rock piles neatly stacked near their tent was truly unsettling, it reminded me of a scene from the TV miniseries ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" (1976) where Falconetti broke into Rudy Jordache's house and moved some of his most personal belongings Â– just enough to let him know that, yes, he had been ""visited"".... No great special effects involved, nosiree, but nonetheless very creepy.<br/><br/>So, this movie, while maybe not truly a ""horror"" movie, is still nevertheless a very unsettling picture, and if you've ever been lost in the woods, or have even the slightest trepidation about wandering too far into the deep woods, especially at night, well, then this picture is for you.

A good case of insomnia where everything looked like an inky black shroud with two unblinking white eyes. Holy macrap I was scared after watching this thing. And it still manages to send shivers down my spine.

Some complain about the shaky camera, but I loved it. It seemed much more natural than any stolid Hollywood camera. And I understand how some might not like this movie, since in the end you never get a good look at the horror that is the Blair Witch and there are no special effects or fancy CGI to speak of. But as for me, I didn't need those things to have a good time. The little things that replaced the whizz-pow effects did the job: the tiny hands on the campers' tent, the hundreds of stick figures wafting in the breeze, and a bushel of teeth and a tongue. That's all the movie had to give me to sufficiently screw up my head. Maybe that is why I didn't like the sequel so much, as it actually was a Hollywood flick that resorted to graphic violence and stupid images of people eating owls (spooky, really) to shock its audience.

The brats in the film look too amateurish to care about in the slightest and it would have been nice to have a more complicated display of emotions that just the perpetual use of swear words, or perhaps, being in my 20's, I'm just too old for this kind of movie. The bigest problem for me was that I just didn't get the feeling that the film makers had really constructed much of a story outside of what's on the screen and concequently instead of having my imagination going into overdrive from all the subtlties that were absent I instead just couldn't make the leap to taking the film seriously. The sequel is supposed to be awful so that should say something about the film makers."

","This movie is very well done and the simple idea of making something like this is worth everything it earned,all the fame,reviews and fanatism is the art of good publicity,In those days when internet rumors made this film a masterpiece for a lot of people before even watching it,Im one of those people. What made me become a real fan of this movie was the obscure references that they showed on the internet,how people shared what they felt when they saw the movie and how terrified they were after watching it,as a true horror genere fan i was in the need of a good scare and a rollercoaster of a ride into the unknown existence of the Blair Witch. The Blair Witch Proyect is what it pretends to be,A well planned proyect that became a huge success and a profit making scheme of a Documentary or `Mockumentary'/Snuff film about 3 college students that went to the woods in the making of a school proyect and got lost. They involve a lot of psichological horror and the chemistry between the actors is not so good and the performance of each of them on the side (See `Cubbyhouse' and you´ll pray for evil spirits to teach Joshua Leonard How to act) is a horrible experiment gone awry,Im sure in a few months we´re going to see this guys in a `Where are they now' Tv show,anyway,they deserve credit for being pioneers on this kind of movies in the 90´s,Thanks to the Blair Witch proyect we got a lot of people interested on making good horror movies and invest in them so that´s a good thing and on the down side we got a sequel that sucks but some people say it´s actually better than the original,You decide,This movie is worth being on a good movie collection,I´ll give it a nice 10 out of 10 on horror at the woods movie.I was such a fan of the blair witch that i actually made some stick men for halloween that year and im the proud owner of a Blair Witch movie maniac figure by todd Mcfarlane,it´s cool. There´s a scene when the lead actress played by Heather Donahue say´s goodbye to all her family and that she´s sorry for all that has happened,and she is crying and sobbing,I found this scene pretty disturbing until i saw it a thousand times later in `Scary Movie' and the `Bogus Witch Proyect' of Pauly Shore (who is funny sometimes)."

","People either are very scared by this film, or they don't find it scary at all. The key to being affected by this film is to allow your imagination to work overtime. You have to want to be scared. You have to imagine that it is you out there in the woods, and forget that it is only a film.<br/><br/>People who are familiar with Freud's theory of the uncanny will understand how the unknown can be more disturbing that what you know or see.<br/><br/>
SOME SPOILERS<br/><br/>For example, many people say ""what's so scary about a stupid pile of rocks or sticks""? Well this is where the theory of the uncanny comes in.  If you had spent the night in a tent in the middle of a forest, only to get out in the morning and find an intricate pile of rocks only inches from your tent, you would be very disturbed. It is clearly not normal. Who in their right mind would be out in a forest like that? You would think that this psycho had been only inches from you, while you were asleep and vulnerable.<br/><br/>Add to this the noises in the middle of the night, which seem to come from all directions, terrifying in the dark, where you can only see with the camera light a few metres in front of you. So to enjoy this film, forget the normal hollywood conventions of horror, deal with the jerky camera movements, and imagine that it is you out there."

","*Possible spoilers*. Now, I like this movie. A lot of people say, ""its not scary"" or ""the camera work was awful"" etc etc. I personally couldn't disagree more.<br/><br/>I like the fact that you are like another character in this film, you see everything they see, you hear what they hear, and it DOES scare you.<br/><br/>
You never see the witch, so it feeds your imagination. The suspense is terrifying, because anyone can make the witch scary. You can build up images in your head, and there are no limits. As for gore, that's not scary, its just disgusting. There are too many films where all that happens is a bunch of teenagers get sliced up - not exactly scary. Suspense, tension, imagination - these are the ingredients that make a horror film.<br/><br/>The scariest films in history have these ingredients, and maybe the Blair Witch Project isn't one of them, but its better than so many other Hollywood rejects. It is chilling, but you can't just sit there expecting to be scared. You have to get involved, you have to make it scary - imagine, see it from the characters point of view, then be chilled."

And if you are in a college film class, I think you would be deserving of all of the praise and accolades possible.  However, when you release that student film as a movie, then you are ripping off people to present it as a real movie.  There is about enough material for a good 20 - 30 minute film, maybe.  But, stretching this one act play into a movie made it tedious and redundant.  And while the idea is clever, it wears thin  when stretched out.  Everyone has their own tastes, but I was surprised by the number of people who actually found the movie scary.  There are some things going bump in the night... but... nothing to really suggest you couldn't have defended yourself with a nice pointy stick.

","When my brother was coming home from visiting relatives on an airplane, he overheard a college student who saw this movie. She said that afterwards, they were so scared nobody wanted to go out for gas. Well, the movie wasn't that scary.<br/><br/>Something that I liked is that they didn't need Conrad Baker or anyone to do the camera work, the three principal actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams) did almost all of it themselves. Heather, Josh, and Michael (the actors's names are the same in the movie) team up for a documentary about a ""blair witch"", who supposadely haunts the woods in Burkettsville, Maryland. After intervewing townspeople, they get off to the woods.<br/><br/>It seems that what TBWP is more about is the three amateur directors and their relationships towards each other. They have ""cabin fever"", so to speak, from being around each other for so long. But, they do find mysterious things outside of their tent after each morning- piles of rocks, for instance. They hear things that go bump in the night and try chase whatever's making the noise.<br/><br/>Soon, the map is lost, in an obvious turn of events. They walk for 15 hours to end up in the same location. There was fear all throughout the movie; mild amount during the day (especially when they see the famous symbols), and moderate during the night. I was truly creeped at the end. I did see this before, on FX, and I was scared at the end. Although the ending is obvious, I do like that style of ending.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a horor film where bloody ghosts pop out and cut your head off, take another one. Nothing is seen here; a couple times, the screen is completly blank except for a couple camera lines at the bottom. The editing was very poor, but I guess they're excuse for that is because it's a ""home movie"". The actors were OK, but I understand why they haven't done anything else. So, if you want to be creeped out for most of the time, rent The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language."

","""The Blair Witch Project"" can best be summed up as ""The Breakfast Club"" moved into the woods for a week-end. Incidents throughout the movie not only ignore practical logic, they throw it out the window. If one of the campers had taken along a cell phone, they could have called out for help. But, if they had, there wouldn't have been a movie.<br/><br/> Most of the terror happens at night. Instead of sleeping during the day and moving away from the danger after dark, these poor helpless souls keep walking right into it. Piles of rocks mysteriously appear at the campsite, suggesting that all three of them slept soundly while the rocks were being piled up within inches of their tent. The map gets kicked into the creek for no apparent reason other then a practical joke. Instead of gathering rocks or tree limbs to use as weapons, they spend the majority of their time screaming at each other about how hungry and lost they are.<br/><br/> Yet, the one true joy about TBWP is that it resembles one of those spooky ghost stories you hear around the campfire. You know it's hoky, yet it's still fun, and that is the genuine quality of this film. I enjoyed it thoroughly."

It's better than those pathetic ""Scream"" movies put out there by Wes Craven (whose films have been getting poorer and poorer ever since ""Deadly Friend""). I admire how the filmmakers came up with a new, fresh idea, casted some young, fresh faces, and filmed this little gem on a very low budget and then went on to make millions as it raked in the cash at the box office. Face it, this movie is scary and it will make you wonder about what is really going on in those woods, what they are really hearing, if there is something authentically supernatural occurring just out of eyesight. Yes, we know that the whole thing is fictional, of course, but you will still be fascinated and not to mention very frightened as three young people venture into the deep, dark woods of Maryland to film a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. From there, everything goes downhill as they find themselves lost, arguing nonstop, and on the verge of hysteria as they realize something sinister and evil is in the woods with them. This presence is merely hinted at but it is so strong you can practically feel it. This inventive trick is another great part of the movie, and it's just great how ritualistic stick figures, piles of stones, and spooky noises in the distance can scare the living hell out of you and get your imagination going. You will actually feel like you're in the woods with these characters and you're wishing for them to get out alive. Bear with this. It starts out slow to develop the characters of Heather, Josh and Mike (who were, all in all, very interesting characters and their constant fighting helped to make the mood even more intense), as it takes us deeper and deeper into the woods, the mood slowly builds from slight unease to full-blown terror. Some may hate the ending and call it abrupt, but I think it is quietly and eerily effective. I don't want to give away much more, so go experience this film for yourself. The leads are very talented and I especially enjoyed Heather Donahue, she was especially great in this film (if I were her, I would have definitely had a three way with those two guys, it's just like they said in Blair Witch 2, it would have been a great stress reliever!).

The biggest complaint coming from the haters of the movie is that it looked cheap and was shot through a video cam. HELLO! Where does it say that every movie ever released needs to be on film, with gorgeous, razor-sharp photography, a rich, professional-sounding musical track, acted by big-name movie stars, in other words, like most of the movies you pay to see at a theatre. I love the fact that so many viewers were waiting for the big wide screen image to come up, AND IT NEVER DID! The creators of the movie had a fabulous idea and they pulled it off completely. Yes, the movie is a kind of trick, or stunt. But aren't all movies, to some degree? Don't we all have to suspend our sense of credibility a bit when we see, for example, Star Wars, or Halloween, or The Green Mile, or ET? These movies do have the look of big-time Hollywood, with the photography and the special effects and the costumes and actors and music. The creators of Blair Witch DELIBERATELY AVOIDED all of that, because it would have been a distraction, and would have gone against everything they were trying to do. If anyone WAS NOT frightened by the last few minutes of Blair Witch, it was because they were having a childish tantrum, thinking (correctly) that this movie wasn't like other movies, and that fact made them uncomfortable and therefore, frustrated. As if to say, ""this movie is bad"".....""I could make a better movie blindfolded"".......""I'm p***ed that I spent my money and time on this crap"", etc.. I have watched movies for 50+ years, and the last five minutes of this movie were right up there with any of the scariest things I've ever seen. I take my hat off to the makers of this film.

","""The Blair Witch Project"" plays like an experimental film and thereby transcends the horror/suspense genre by being so different.  Alas it was ruined by the extreme hype it received.  Not all reviews were very favorable in the first place, but the overhype was generated from the belief early on in the film's limited release that what we were watching was real footage shot by three people who were actually missing.<br/><br/>It's too bad.  Think about all you have heard after its major release.  ""It wasn't THAT scary"" and ""I got motion-sickness"" were the two most common remarks I heard, next to ""It was the stupidest movie I have ever seen."" Why?  The first remark is in response to the people who saw it early on and believed it to be the scariest film they had ever seen, causing higher expectations.  The second comes from people who sat too close, and the third from people who expected a LOT more than psychological trauma as the true subject of a horror film.  <br/><br/>Did they want gut-spilling?  Explosions?  The supernatural depicted through cheesy special effects, as seen in a movie like ""The Haunting?"" Please. ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an exercise in realism, using psychological terror (not what you see, but what you don't see) as its weapon, and it IS one of the scariest films ever made.  I saw it in the theatre, still believing that what was onscreen was possibly real.  Throughout the film, I was afraid and emotionally horrified, and by the end I was curled up on my seat into a ball, shivering and teary-eyed.  That's how powerful it was.<br/><br/>Ignore the hype.  Of course, by now it has died down, so folks may not even remember what a big deal the movie was at the time of its release.  I only wish the sequel was handled differently.  While it was spooky at certain points, its lack of realism (and real acting) had nowhere near the impact of the first.  Speaking of the acting...the performances of the three stars of this film truly added to us believing it was real, and therefore are worth the price of a rental alone."

Things may not happen on screen, there may be no jump out of your seat moments or no moments featuring blood and guts, which are normally associated with the modern-day horror film but Blair Witch did, in my opinion, fill the viewer with a sense of discomfort and dread in much the same ways as the equally chilling Japanese films Ring and Audition did. It may have taken many of its stylistic inventions from such films like The Last Broadcast and Cannibal Holocaust (both great films in their own right) but it doesn't distract from the fact that the film engulfs the viewer with a sense of horror and dread and a uncontrollable fear for the viewer is not in control when watching the film for they have no idea what is going to happen next. In our times when the silver screen is filled with teen-slasher movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend it is good to see that independent films can make a load of money and be critically successful at the same time. The Blair Witch Project is still one of the most talked about films in recent years and one of the most innovative as can be seen when you compare it to its glamourised and Hollywoodised very poor follow-up Blair Witch 2."

Sure, if you think people act badly in real life.<br/><br/>I will say this though, in reality ""plots"" don't exist, life is just a bunch of events. That's where this film shines, the plot is realistically incoherent and flow less. Is it a good idea to base a film on the things about life that don't work in film? No.<br/><br/>I hope this film goes down in history as something that was hyped up beyond reproach and then turned out to be one of the worst films in recent history.

","I wanted so much to love this movie.  After all the hype, the good press, and the other reviews available, I really wanted for this film to somehow profoundly affect me, either by scaring the living crud out of me, or to give something to me that no other film has been able to do in the past.<br/><br/>This film, sadly, does not deliver.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing that distinguishes this film from any other horror genre fare.  There's some tension, that's well produced as you hope to discover what it is that's going on, but in the end that's all there is--tension.<br/><br/>This could have been so much better.  For all the hype, this SHOULD have been so much better.  <br/><br/>As an avid moviegoer perhaps I'm jaded, but I just do not see what the big deal is with The Blair Witch Project.  <br/><br/>When reviewing a movie for the IMDB, I have the duty to make an accurate assessment, sometimes I have to take a bit longer to come to my senses and resist the urge to issue forth praise that is unwarranted (in my opinion). Most of the positive feedback this film has garnered is just that: unwarranted priase.<br/><br/>Anyone truly scared by this film has either a weak constitution or has never seen some of the truly great films of the horror genre.  To those people, I suggest (strongly) that you hit the local video store more often.  And in your renting you will find films that will make the Blair Witch Project pale in comparison.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project will not withstand the test of time."

I really wanted to see it, could it be a movie that finally kept me up at night? The Exorcist couldn't do it but maybe this ""Scary as Hell"" movie could. I THINK NOT!!!! It started off so good with the interviews but it got messier ( camera wise) and all that happened was people running around saying ""Oh my god what the F*ck was that"". When all you heard was water dripping and sometimes someone laughing. Oh its such a good idea but its wasted! I really would love to make a movie like this but not screw it up! The ending when Heather and Michael were in the house was confusing. I dont wantt to give the ending away but was it the witch or that guy that killed 7 kids???

","First of all, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is NOT a horror movie in  the way all these teen slasher movies are these days.  It's way worse than that. After watching these 3 ""actors"" in the woods for nearly an hour and a half, me and many like me in the theater kinda went, ""So?""  It was different and kind of neat with the first person perspective.  And that's pretty much all it had going for it.<br/><br/>The most disturbing thing about the movie is that people think that it's real.  Why would a true story shot with real footage have directors?  Can you imagine the legal implications of releasing this movie if it were real? I heard a comment leaving the theater from a girl who said, ""If it wasn't real, they did a very good job making it look real!""  Of course it looked real! It was shot with a 16mm camera by people running through the woods. But it's not a true story, and the Blair Witch doesn't exist, not even as a legend. It was made up by the directors and fueled by internet sites that the staff of the movie created.<br/><br/>As a suspensful artsy flick it was great.  The only problem is not too many people like artsy movies that look this bad.  As ""the scariest movie ever"" it sucked and fell way, way short of expectations.  If not for all the profanity (of which there is quite a bit) this movie could have been rated PG, with no gore, no sex, no drug use, no violence to boost it any higher.<br/><br/>In August of 1999, I dissapeared into a theater near Escanaba, Michigan while going to see a ""documentary.""

","I was disappointed in this movie after seeing it.  It is a very unique film, and its ability to actively involve the audience through ""real"" film footage is brilliant, but it lacks momentum and thrills.  The chilling aspect of the movie just isn't that strong.  The ending of the movie is very disturbing, but not all that shocking.  In fact, it is rather predictable.  The amateur nature of this film, while it does give the audience a strong sense of reality, is also the film's weakness because between the so-called frightening scenes is a large lull that consists of little more than constant arguing among the characters.  While the arguments are sometimes humorous, they also get tiresome very quickly.  This film is far above most horror films in terms of style, plot, and acting, but could and should have been more chilling than it was.  An audience's imagination can only go so far.  I would still recommend this movie, though, because it is a unique film experience."

","People are saying that this film did not live up to the hype, but I don't think that word is specific enough.  This wasn't hyped like ""Godzilla"" was or ""The Phantom Menace"" was.  The hype behind this movie was mainly well received analyses from the nation's top critics.  In this way, ""hype"" should not be used as the slur it usually is.  <br/><br/>As far as my review of the movie itself, I think this is truly one of the greatest horror movies of all-time.  I've seen many horror flicks and some have made me scream, squirm, and become silent a little.  This is the only film I have ever seen that had my heart beating rapidly and left me with images I couldn't shake for days.  <br/><br/>I think the reason why some people have not liked this movie as much as I have is because many people need a singular object in a movie to scare them (i.e. Jason with a chain saw or Michael Myers with a butcher knife).  This movie combines many eerie elements with remarkable character development into the story.  You must pay attention to the littlest detail (especially at the beginning) to understand the true terror this film conveys.  <br/><br/>My message to everyone is: Allow yourself to become wrapped up in the intricacies and the character's plight in ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and maybe you'll have one of the greatest film experiences of your life.

","The Blair Witch Project is the most unique approach to horror that I have ever seen.  This is the first time I have actually felt the real emotion in a horror flick.  And though the film itself is creepy beyond creepy, the most unsettling thing about it is that I found myself incapable of turning my bedroom light off that night.  And I DO mean incapable.  The film plants unpleasant seeds in your imagination.  And therefore the audience brings the horror home with them. The shaky camera handling and home video feel of the film convinces us that we are seeing something real, something that perhaps we are not supposed to see.  Such an effect can only result in tension and suspense, making for an interesting reaction when things finally go bump in the night. An incredibly imaginative and clever film, The Blair Witch Project is a definite must-see for anyone immune to motion-sickness."

","Okay.<br/><br/>I've seen the hype.  I've seen the documentary on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I've seen the movie.  I've seen the movies that ""Blair Witch"" is either based on or similar to.  I've seen the reviews.  I've bitched about how similar it was to ""The Last Broadcast"".<br/><br/>Now, the good things and a few more bitches.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" was a creepy flick.  Heather Donahue did an EXCELLENT job. The lack of music score keeps you from becoming detached, and the fact it's on video leads you to fool yourself into thinking it's real (i.e. - film is fake, television is real).<br/><br/>It was NOT an original movie, at least, not for an indie film or a public access project.  I've seen similar shows done on public access.  The producers of ""Blair Witch"" just used what they had to make a movie that would have required a MUCH larger budget otherwise.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Blair Witch"" is adequate.  The only thing in this movie that made people queasy was motion sickness.  The movie starts off promisingly, moves along ploddingly, then lurches to a halt just when it's getting interesting. The ending, which is supposed to show us a hint of the terror that awaits our intrepid filmmakers, instead betrays the buildup the producers worked so hard to craft. I understand that it relates to something said earlier in the film, and that the ending is SUPPOSED to leave the fates of the characters to our imagination, but there's TOO much left to our imagination.  This film has no real conclusion, no real closure or satisfaction at the end.  Creepy? Maybe, maybe not.  I guess it depends on how easily frightened you are.  I found it to be obvious and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>For those of you who say that the similarity between ""Blair Witch"" and ""The Last Broadcast"", a film nearly identical in it's story and motivation, is irrelevant and pointless...think again.  Most of what the critics who love this film have to say about ""Blair Witch"" is with regards to it's originality.  ""Last Broadcast"", whose tone is less eerie and more of a documentary, is superior in that it doesn't treat the viewer like a child. Small wonder that ""Blair Witch"" is so popular with the teen crowd.  Take away the claim that ""Blair Witch"" is an original idea, and you have a moderately scary supernatural suspense film.<br/><br/>Check out ""Cannibal Holocaust"", ""The Last Broadcast"", and ""Man Bites Dog"" to see just how ""original"" this movie is.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong;  my last post notwithstanding, I thought that ""Blair Witch"" was just fine...but it was NOT original, it was NOT scary, and it was NOT worth the hour-and-a-half of my time, and the eight bucks I spent to see it.  If not for the hype on the Sci-Fi Channel, it would have gone straight to video."

Basically the one sentence that was used over and over again was ""No, you shut up"". The sad part of this movie was that it had the potential to be a great character movie.

","Ok, here's my two cents. I've probably seen thousands of horror movies and made a couple of my own so I feel a little qualified to comment on this one. I loved it. Original and scary. The tension builds in a smooth crescendo until the final five or ten minutes when it becomes so high that the theater is permeated with it. Everyone on the edge of their seats. As usual, ignore the hype and just see it. I think this would have been way cooler had I just discovered it on the shelf at a video store with a layer of dust on it. But then these folks who made it wouldn't be getting paid what the certainly deserve for kicking Big Hollywood in the ass. This is a wake-up call. CGI is not scary!!!!! Try some originality!!! Alot of people who like this movie have said it's a refreshing break from the resurgence of splatter films we are experiencing. What resurgence? Along with all the campy splatter/slasher movies of the seventies and eighties there were some real gems. Argento, Soavi, Romero, and even John Carpenter defined horror in those days. The Blair Witch Project should not be compared to those kinds of films. That's just not what it is. It's a little closer to Polanski's ""Repulsion"" or something. A thriller not a splatter. I heard people walking out of the theater after the show I saw lamenting that no one ""got their arm ripped off"". That's a shame. I'm just waiting for Warner Bros. and the rest of them to try to make $50 million look like $5,000. That will be hilarious! Jan Du Bont with a palmcorder! Ha, ha, ha!!!"

Contrary to the hype, there are NO thrills in this movie.  The quality of the filming is bad, maybe purposefully, but it does not add to the authenticity of the movie, it only gives the unfortunate viewer a headache.  The story starts out okay, but then it goes to a virtual standstill, with nothing happening for 60 minutes.  When things eventually start happening the viewer gets excited, only to be let down.  This happens time and time again, you get excited, wait for it, wait for it...bummer, nothing.  I told the story to my mother in four sentences, that is all there is to this movie.  No character depth, no real plot, no satisfactory scary scenes.  This movie is one big let down.  I was looking forward to the ending...unfortunately it turned out to be the worst part of the movie.  I was left feeling frustrated, uncertain about what exactly had happened at the end, completely and utterly UNSATISFIED.  I would usually say: ""try harder"", but this time my advice to the creators of this film would be: ""Quit now.  Please?"""

","I was so ready to be scared watching this film.  I had just seen Deep Blue Sea the day before (a far ""scary"" film in terms of shocks & thrills) and was thoroughly disappointed.  As an indy film maker, I could relate to the kids quest, and felt the acting (yes it is acting, the situation is *not* real) was wonderful.  This movie succeeds based on the audience identifying with them - that is, identifying with the feeling of being alone in the woods and have some very strange things going on.  <br/><br/>However, while all if this is very effective in setting up a very creepy situation that gets eerier and wierder as the film progresses, there is no pay off at the end.  None of what happens amounts to anything.  We are told at the beginning that the kids are missing (and presumably dead) and really have no more information than that at the end.  The film would have been better served with some framing sequences that include the information included on the web site, which put the film in context and offers far more information on the Blair Witch and the mythology than the film has on its own.  The film alone is a serious let-down.  As part of a multi-media event (movie, web site, Sc-Fi channel documentary) it is an interesting, if ultimately pointless, exercise in creative film making."

","I was looking forward to seeing this film, the reputation that preceded it reminded me of the Lovecraft style of horror. However, the innovation of the faux-documentary is watered down with numerous errors and flaws, not the least of which being *product*placement* in the beginning of a documentary! The scare are genuine, although one of the night sounds, once introduced, is over-used. The premise of the three hikers becoming lost also becomes increasingly implausible, with or without a witch chasing them. This *is* probably the scariest film this year, but the competition so far is lightweight at best. Some viewers will walk out of the film simply confused, since it requires concentration from the audience to achieve the full effects intended. However, if you pay attention too closely, the flaws in the film became too abvious. If you want to see a scary film, go ahead and see Blair witch.

I liked the movie a lot and I understand what is was trying to do and it was a valid attempt but it didn't work for me.

It was clever in its approach and again, I give it credit for what it attempted to do.  <br/><br/>My major problem was the quality of the sound in the movie (After re-mixing was done by Artisan) which is pretty amazing for three ""students"" with basic equipment.  Plus, the lighting within the house was pretty darn good for one cam-corder to provide.

","The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie that easily kept my attention, but I'm afraid the atmosphere in the theater wasn't exactly conducive to the eerie mood the movie attempted to create.<br/><br/>I saw it at the Lakewood 15 last weekend, in the company of what felt like about 50,000 shouting, giggling, popcorn-throwing, guffawing, snorting pseudo-teens.  It seemed that they were there, not to consider the movie on its own merits, but because they thought it would be a hip, raw, scarefest blockbuster.  It wasn't and isn't, so don't go if that's what you're looking for.  If the audience hadn't been expecting Freddie Kruger to mysteriously materialize with a gore-dripping chain saw, they might have been able to identify with the characters and realize what an unnerving experience it would be to be lost, frustrated, and hearing weird sounds in the night.  And they might have been drawn into the movie enough to flinch and squirm when the REALLY scary part finally happened, like I did, even under such poor movie-viewing conditions.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a quietly entertaining movie with supernatural overtones as well as subtle commentary on changing group dynamics in the current age, go see it; then maybe the theater will be quiet enough that the movie can weave its spooky web around you.  I can't guarantee it will happen, but I suspect that the absence of popcorn and Milk Dud missiles makes any non-""Police Academy""-type movie better."

","What a disappointment!  Perhaps if I had thought, as apparently some friends of mine did, that this was real as opposed to a movie, I might have been genuinely frightened.  Instead I was bored.  A group of people screaming at each other and telling us that they are scared is not, in itself, frightening.  At some point, something has to happen.<br/><br/>The 'innovative' approach of this film, while certainly a good idea, is very frustrating in execution.  On a large screen the jerkiness of the film is at times almost nauseating.  The camera frequently focuses on the ground as whichever character that is holding it lets their arm drop, and at times it isn't actually focused at all.  The result - a static and blurred image accompanied by off-camera arguing - is less than appealing.<br/><br/>The central characters do a good job of improving their way through the scenes (they are decent actors), but the lack of structure leads to some fairly aimless, pointless scenes.<br/><br/>Finally, it's not scary.  The idea that what we can't see is more frightening than what we can see has been used to great effect in the past (witness Robert Wise's 'The Haunting') but only in very carefully made films.  Edge-of-your-seat tension must be painstakingly built, and cannot happen by accident."

","Yes, this movie is amazing. Amazing how incompetence can turn a fairly decent premise into an almost complete disaster.  I went into the Blair Witch Project expecting not to be scared, but entertained, naively assuming that this was a well made and clever movie. Instead I got an hour and a half (but felt about twice as long) of three individuals alternating between petty bickering,  disabled  monologues directed to the camera and swearing at nothing in particular.  The set up to this film is non existent, no outside information regarding the Blair Witch is given beyond what you need to understand the unsatisfying ending.  That I think is the biggest flaw of the movie.  The viewer is supposed to believe this is real, but there is no sense that the witch is larger than the myopic scope of the movie.  Her presence is almost secondary, and is most assuredly not the driving force of the movie.  Secondly, the characterization in this movie left a lot to be desired. In a movie with  such a narrow focus you need to see the depth of characters, but you learn nothing of Heather and Mike, and they come off as totally unsympathetic.  That's two thirds of the cast. Finally, the unsteady, continual bouncing and out of focus shots from the camera are distracting and keep drawing you out of the movie.  It's hard enough to tell what's going on in the dark and the limited view from a video camera jerking around simply detracts from the film's effectiveness.  While the person I sat next to the theater seemed to be taken in, most of the rest of the audience wasn't, and there was much heckling and cackling and many (including myself) laughed out loud at the ending.  One man stood up and in a rather booming voice announced, ""That was lame"".  I couldn't have said it better myself.  <br/><br/>2/10"

","Notice i said CHILLER, 'cause this movie or docu-horror pic, leaves chills down your spine long after the movie is done. It is well done and original. You actually FEEL what the characters are feeling, and also it helps that at the fact the actors in here are obviously not well known. That even helps the audience identify with the characters. I also think that most of the dialogue leading up to 2nd day in the woods, was actually good. Some others didn't think so, or at least focused more on thre profanity, which was used quite frequently LATER on in the film.<br/><br/>However I must say, it scares you more in the mind, but any visual scares acre more chilling than terorizing, especially for the ""main-stream"" audience. Actually the ""main-stream"" audience would probably be dissapointed at not only the fact it operates at a low budget, but also that it is filmed in documentary style, and has alot running and screaming at things that you can't even see. <br/><br/>Besides that I think it was a well made movie, which u could feel the terror the characters went through as they search for the Blair Witch. Its scares might even fall short for one or two scenes(which i won't explain)cause i and my sister who i took with me, found ourselves laughing. But it quickly got creepy toward the end, and the end will leave u either disapointed, wanting more, or it will stay with u for days. Good Filmaking I'll give it *** stars out of ****"

","Having been as curious as anybody else over the buzz this film has been generating ever since Sundance, I went to see it on opening day to see what the fuss is all about.  Some critics said that it's the scariest movie they've ever seen, even scarier than THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE EXORCIST.  Well, I wouldn't go THAT far.  This movie is extremely well-made and well-acted, and the filmmakers certainly deserve credit by stretching their shoestring budget extremely well.  The film is shot entirely with a video camera and a 16mm black and white film camera.  The woods where the three ambitious young filmmakers go to explore the Blair Witch legend are claustrophic and creepy.  The film borrows inspiration from many horror films such as THE EVIL DEAD, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DELIVERANCE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The difference here is that there is virtually no blood or gore on display, which will no doubt disappoint some viewers.  The emphasis is on the characters' psychological and mental deterioration as they get lost deeper and deeper in the woods.  The only complaint I have about the film is that it doesn't really pay off by the conclusion.  It builds a reasonable amount of tension, especially during the nighttime scenes, and we keep waiting for some big revelation, and we don't really get it.  Time and again scenes keep building and toying with us, and we expect to jump out of seats by something scary, but it never happens.  It's like watching a porno movie without any sex scenes."

So, there we were sitting in the theater waiting to be scared and it never happened. I guess I'm just jaded or something.  Now, I admire the film as innovative and different.

I told this to a young friend of mine, and then he went to see it and was scared out of his wits!  I have heard some people say that the reason they were so scared, was because it was true and the footage was the actual footage!  How funny is that?  People really think this is real!  Hey folks, it's a movie --  written by writers and those are actors.  I guess if it were real, it would truly be scary, but then we wouldn't be seeing it in a movie theater.

They just ain't too scary. Suspense and good-timing make the film, in my eyes.  So I can definitely agree with the critics on this one; it was great.  Wait, scratch that, it was UNFORGETTABLE.  I researched this movie for 2 months before it came out, so I pretty much know everything about the production.  But I avoided spoilers, of course (a GREAT idea).  I was spellbound by this film, just as I had hoped I would be.  But my showing was FILLED with teenage-idiots.  I anxiously awaited the ending, after which, I had heard, the audience goes dead quiet and you are just CHILLED.  Well, as soon as the credits started to roll, some jerk sitting behind me, I think he was 18 or 19, stood up and started rudely mimicking Heather's dramatic confession sequence.  Loudly.  I was ready to turn around and kick him, but no, I am a nice little girl and wouldn't sink to his level.  It's SO rude to stand up and announce what you thought of a film in front of other people.  I agree with the others on this page who said that this film was wasted on the general public.  So maybe it wasn't as scary as the hype promises.  The storyline is FABULOUS, the ""acting"" BLEW ME AWAY, and the ending was something that will have you leaving the lights on while you sleep.  Most kids my age don't understand that a movie can freak you out even if it doesn't have excessive uses of gore and cheap ""throw-the-howling-kitty-cat-into-the-frame"" shots that ""scare people"".  Yes those shots are scary.  To 10-year-olds.  This is not your average horror flick of today.  Thank God.

Personally, I wasn't impressed, and one kid in front of me got up after it was over and said ""it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be"" and all of his friends agreed. So be warned -- Your Mileage May Vary.<br/><br/>I didn't find the characters sympathetic, and although believable, most of the time they were just plain annoying. If I had been with that group of people, I would've quietly slipped away and followed a river back to civilization and left them to wander around in circles and scream at each other like a bunch of idiots. The witch wants 'em? Great, she can keep 'em.<br/><br/>However - the characters in this film are incidental to the overall concept, which is the real star of the show, and my central complaint. This isn't a great film - It's a great concept done in a mediocre way. Compare and contrast with, say, ""Silence of the Lambs"", which took a mediocre concept - a cannibal serial killer meets an attractive female FBI agent - and made it into something great. Most of what makes ""Lambs"" so effective is the character of Clarice, and how much we believe in her and like her.<br/><br/>

This movie and its success only proves you don't need a big budget..or ANY budget..to make a successful movie! It disturbs me to hear about a backlash developing over Blair Witch, and yet it doesn't surprise me. Anytime something becomes successful, there's always some group out there wanting to bring it down. Those who don't like Blair Witch need everything spelled out them for them and made obvious.

","Hi All!<br/><br/>I finally got to see BWP & I have to say I was disappointed.  My biggest problems with it included: 1) The actors, whom I felt just weren't that good (""Mike"" was OK, ""Heather"" was variable, & ""Josh"" was annoying); 2) The characters, who tended to act in such a way as to best advance the plot--sitting & sulking when they should be getting the heck out of there, and getting helplessly lost in the middle of the crowded eastern seaboard. I mean, even a tenderfoot like me knows to follow a creek downstream to find civilization.  And why didn't they bring a cell phone--a necessity for camping out in the 90's?; 3) The technical qualities in some instances--the sounds the characters heard, for example, were muddy & indistinct, at least in the theatre in which I saw the film.  All these things detracted from the ability of this viewer to suspend disbelief, something very important for a horror film.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I did like the jumpy camera work & the fact that the characters weren't very sympathetic people since those things *helped* the reality of the film.  And the townsfolk who appeared at the start of the film were pretty good, especially the little girl who helped add to the anticipation of scariness.  What she did looked so unscripted that it seemed really creepy.  In sum, I think BWP is similar to the Exorcist--a not that scary movie which drives people crazy due to their expectations of being scared.  Maybe the sequel will be better.<br/><br/>p.s. In fairness, I should note that I saw the movie in a theatre with a bunch of chatty, restless people & that didn't help my enjoyment of the film.  But I don't think my opinion would have been much different had I seen it under better circumstances.  I would say that this may make better viewing on video than in the movies."
"Headshot","2","0","2","5 August 1999"," Suspenseful and scary, but hardly original
","For those of you who went to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" and gasped in both horror and delight at how ""original"" it was...listen to this. <br/><br/>
I saw ""Blair Witch"", and thought that it was a fine bit of filmmaking.  It told it's story well, the performances were adequate, and the film was interesting visually.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>This film almost seems to rip it's plot element-for-element from another independent mock-documentary entitled, ""The Last Broadcast"" released<br/><br/>last year.  That story also involved a group of filmmakers who went out into the woods to shoot a documentary and were mysteriously murdered.  The film also made liberal use of ""documentary"" footage taken from video cameras to tell it's story.  The problem is that ""Last Broadcast"" was filmed and released nearly a full year before ""Blair Witch"".  In my opinion, ""Blair Witch"" is both a blatant rip-off of the same essential plot and construction used for ""Last Broadcast"", and that irks me.<br/><br/>What irks me more is the fact that so many people have said over and over again just how ""original and inventive"" this film is.  I thought ""Blair Witch"" was merely adequate.  Where ""Last Broadcast"" was thoughtful and sneaky in it's approach, ""Blair Witch"" is loud and obvious.  I found many of the visuals used in ""Blair Witch"" to be remarkably similar to those used in ""Last Broadcast"", to the point where ""Blair Witch"" almost seems like a sequel or spin-off.<br/><br/>In the end, there will be many copies of ""Blair Witch"" released by rival studios, trying to cash in on it's success.  But in my opinion, the producers of ""Blair Witch"" cheated.  ""Last Broadcast"" stands as my favorite between these two nearly identical films."

","What kind of movie-goer am I? I'll tell you. I go to the bargain matinee. Saturday Night Live better do a sketch about this movie. It's already reached cult status. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm the kind of movie-goer who decides, in that moment when getting up out of my seat at the end, after watching for the ENTIRE 82 minutes, whether or not I got my money's worth.<br/><br/>I had visited the movie's official web site beforehand. I even heard word-of-mouth about the flick from people who had seen the Sci-Fi Channel's coverage on it. I knew it wasn't true. I knew that this movie created a buzz at Sundance, and in movie circles in print and online. I realize that these neophyte filmakers wanted to produce a successful movie. I don't know if they actually think this work is any more than performance art, or if they think it's a milestone in cinematic expression. By any standards, one that puts the asses in the seats to the tune of over $36M in less than a week of its nationwide release, especially when it cost only $25K or $60K to make, (depending on what article is correct) qualifies it as a HUGE success. I only wish that it had been a better movie. I can't help but feel I've been taken by the gimmick. The hype is rarely ever matched by the product, is it? It wasn't supposed to be a real movie was it? Just ""documentary footage"" that was found and put together. That would cover a multitude of cinematic sins, wouldn't it? Doesn't hurt to cover your bases, does it? It could even be bad, huh?<br/><br/>Ingenious as it is, the marketing of this production-on-a-shoestring delivers a first effort that left me unsatisfied. I agree that there were a few great moments that were genuinely creepy, but they were separated by far too much tedious repetition included for the sake of ""realism."" The fighting, yelling, and screaming at each other came quite quickly, it seems, for a movie that went so slowly. After only a couple days in the woods they mentally ""fell apart."" The ""improvised acting"" suffered a bit there. The things that went bump in the night promised something more that never came. The distant unknown sounds and voices were as scary as it got, and could have led to something else, but never really did, beyond the blurry images inside the house, maybe. The ending was actually a relief. It finally put an end to the crying, the yelling, the shaking camera, and the almost endless asking, ""What was that??!!!""  We never do find out, and have to figure it must've been the wicked witch of Blair. It WAS something. Right?  I have to laugh at the people who say they're the only one who ""got"" the movie. Many people are reading things into this movie's ending, but if it makes you feel better...<br/><br/>You can discuss whether or not the actors are hotties, thanks to the previous ""Scream"" and ""...Last Summer"" movies, and talk about the ticket sales and statistics, but why not talk about what makes some movies really good, others really great, and some a waste of time. I can't say this one was a waste. You should see what the fuss and hype is all about, but don't expect a classic. There are people risking fortunes every day who think they know what would make a good movie. These particular guys accomplished something imaginative that will certainly be imitated. They tried to scare us without using a big bank roll, special effects, gore, monster costumes, puppets, guns, explosions, or gratuitous nudity, sex and violence. That alone is a novel idea. They used sticks and stones and sounds and darkness. I consider that an extremely brave approach when you're aiming at the cynical, computer-literate, self-absorbed, seen-it-all, mostly 17-34 year old, MTV Generation movie audience member who just forked over $4.25 to $9.00 per person and said, ""Okay, now scare me."" <br/><br/>Hey, if I could make a better movie I would. I'm only speaking from an actor's perspective, and as a person who likes movies. They're the ones who had the guts to turn a few good ideas into millions at the box office, not me. <br/><br/>I'm the kind of movie-goer who is hopeful. Since Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick will have a bigger budget to work with on their next project, which they claim will be a wacky comedy, I hope that it will do a much better job at making me laugh than The Blair Witch Project did at scaring me. It would be nice to get my money's worth. I wonder if they need any more unknown actors...<br/><br/>Wait a minute... did you hear something? What was that???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The horror is not from the things that go bump in the night or the realization that their is a spook in the woods but the inexplicable notion that we are victims of some cruel inescapable cosmic or supernatural joke and no one knows or cares.

","Yes, I bought into the hype and paid 8 bucks for the tripe.  I know at least a dozen other people that have seen the film, and not ONE of them thought it worth the prize of a chiclet, much less what they're charging for admission these days.  I considered the comments of one of the reviewers, that the theater atmosphere would have a large impact on your appreciation for BWP, but I dismissed that right away when I considered that I saw it at an indie theater with a very eager college crowd.  Yes, they were silent during the course of the film, but the consensus was, after the credits, ""was that IT?!? You HAVE to be kidding me?!"" Wake UP people.  Don't feel compelled to jump on the indie bandwagon and wave the BWP flag JUST because they spent only $60,000 (and believe me, it shows).  Don't feel compelled to say you liked it because of the couple of weeks of sold out shows due to extremely limited release (which propagated the hype).  Admit it to yourselves and you'll be happier: THIS...MOVIE...SUCKED.  It was a dreadful bore.  It was also misleading. The snippets shown in the trailer are (virtually) all from the last 5 minutes of the movie.  The trailer also featured a haunting score.  Yes, it would make sense that in a documentary style film that there would not be a score.  This was simply ""found footage"".  Then why not sell what you really are; why put a score in the trailer?  Because a score creates atmosphere, of which this movie has NONE.  The beginning had some promise, but if you get riveted and scared from watching 70-odd minutes in between of footage of trees, sticks, rocks, and people whining at each other about being lost and tired and hungry, you need help.  ""Oh! shall we go south? No! Let's go north! We saw that tree this morning! We saw that tree yesterday! We're lost! Waaaah!""  Give me a break. The most agonizing part is that I realized what they were TRYING to do...they were TRYING (but failing miserably) to illustrate the psychological breakdown of three documentarians in the woods.  If THAT is your construct, wherefore this contrived background of ""..footage found one year later.."".  Why make that up?  Did you not want the female character to shut the hell up after 15 minutes?

","This movie is being sold as a surprise hit, a revolutionary film that will change movies forever, and a fine example of truely independent film-making. It is none of these things.  As to the first, the release of this movie was carefully orchestrated by Artisan to maximize profits, to the detriment of all else.  If you think that this movie did so well it's first week because everyone spontaneously recognized it's genius, you're an idiot...it did well because Artisan hyped it on MTV shows, in commercials, etc.  Secondly, this film is not that revolutionary, and it will not inspire other film-makers. How many movies with this kind of jerky camera work (for instance) can the average movie-goer take?  The answer is ""Not many more than one"", and if there's no market for it, Hollywood won't make it.  Also, the way this film was made is just an exaggerated form of the camera work done by directors with TALENT, such as David Lynch and Oliver Stone.  In addition, it's conceit is borrowed from a movie that IMDB lists...go look up the remake section on the page.  Finally, if you want to see a true independent movie that became a success because of its quality and word of mouth, see Clerks or Reservoir Dogs; the film-making here is atrocious.  The dialogue is terrible, probably worse than Manos:The Hand of Fate.  The characters do little more than swear at each other and complain.  The ending is the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.  The people who made this movie couldn't be bothered to think of what their ""witch"" actually was.  Finally, the allegedly ""scary"" sections were very non-scary.  OOOOHHHHHH!  Rocks! and stick figures! thats pretty scary.  and funny goo too!  wow, im quaking!  I give this movie a 3/10 (and not lower), because some of the camera work is cool and the concept is a decent one, when we're not looking at a black screen and listening to poorly faked hyperventilation.  This movie was clearly made because THE MAN realized he could make a movie for $40,000 and still charge us $8 to see it.  Im sure they've spent many times what they spent on the movie on advertising all ready, just to make sure that all the impressionable people will line up with their money; don't get sucked in, don't believe the hype, and if you do have the misfortune to see this, rate it and get it out of the top 250."

You say its scary because its left to the imagination, perhaps, but only when done in a certain style. Only several people could do that, foremost, Alfred Hitchcock. What this film does it bring a kind of mediocre Hitchcock to a young audience. The camera work is not subjective, its annoying. They want to do it in that style, fine, but have a Stead-i-Cam. Its not scary, is my biggest problem. We need a film like the Exorcist. As put in Entertainment Weekly ""A cat jumping from offscreen is scary, the Exorcist is so disturbing it will mess you up for months.""

Of course this is the problem with almost all horror movies made today.  If someone would only make a horror movie that didn't use stupidity to move the plot along then perhaps we would see a scary movie.  Another problem the movie had was an inconsistency in the behavior of one of the characters who goes from being a complete coward to someone who doesn't appear to be scared of anything at the end. Between myself and the others in my group as well as several people I've talked to since I've seen the movie, we've come up with a sizable list of things wrong with this movie. <br/><br/>However, here's the bottom line: its a great concept and I'd love to see a re-make of this movie."
"Pipes","4","0","2","3 August 1999"," The Blair Witch Project was over hyped, over compared and made me sick to my stomach.
","Silence of the Lambs was the best thriller movie I have ever seen and had been highly compared to the quality of The Blair Witch Project. So, admittedly, my expectations were pretty high. The Blair Witch Project is a documentary of the legend of the Blair Witch that is filmed by three college students. The movie itself is made up of the actual tape and film that they shot on their handheld camcorder and movie camera. Upon interviewing the locals they attempt to find the Blair Witch deep in the woods. Eventually, they lose their map, get lost and the characters become pretty scared, although I did not. This movie really had nothing to do with being a scary film and more to do with how angry the characters become with each other for being lost in the woods and to see how many times they can use the `F' word. Furthering my disappointment was that ninety percent of the film is dedicated to shots of the forest floor as they are running about hysterically. So all you really every see is leaves and twigs and dirt shaking violently on the screen. This new trend in filmmaking is an empty attempt to portray the movie through the viewer's own eyes and left me with an upset stomach for hours afterwards. It was so bad that I counted at least a dozen other people who had to leave the movie altogether. If Breaking the Waves made you even slightly squeamish, then don't see Blair Witch unless you want to barf in your neighbor's popcorn bag. This movie had neither clever acting nor an interesting plot and it came no where close to putting you on the edge of your seat like Silence of the Lambs did. The only good thing about Blair Witch was the end, when the torture was finally over."

The point of the in-film documentary was what could the Blair Witch be (good: kind-hearted yokels, bedtime stories, or bad: evil copycats, truly malevolent ectoplasmic miasma, cartoon villains?); but halfway through, that ambiguity was lost. The major flaw of the film was there was no other possible explanation than the one we were lead to believe. Things were too much what they seemed.

Some other parts really just annoyed or confused me... there was too much bickering in daylight between the students, and yes, some have pointed this out as well: if they just followed the creek, they should have been able to get back, out of the woods at the least, to the outside world. The daytime shots, however, really got to me; after a while, you realize nothing frightening happens at daytime, and around 90% of the movie conists of daytime shots.  If the movie had more nighttime scenes that played with the mind a bit more (not this running around aimlessly with the camera's video off), then it might have frightened me even a tiny bit.  I give the Blair Witch Project a two out of ten, since it was intended to be a horror movie but failed pretty miserably at that.  One way the movie could have potentially been scarier is if they had more night shots and less painful-to-watch daytime shots.

","My 15-year-old daughter & I went to see the Blair Witch Project, that I'd heard from several people was ""the scariest movie they'd ever seen"". My daughter thought it was scary, I thought it was crappy. The acting is very good - the actors appear absolutely natural, which is how it's supposed to look. I think you're supposed to empathise with the characters and feel sorry for their demise; I found them a bunch of losers who couldn't read a map, have no survival skills whatsoever, and who spend their time bickering about whose fault it is they're lost - by the end of the movie I thought they got what they deserved.

","The only thing frightening about this movie is I paid good money to see it. Let me sum it all up for you.  Three fools go out into the woods to find some evidence of the Blair Witch.  After a couple of days and nights they determine they are lost and cannot find their way out of the woods.  These three losers couldn't find their way out of a paper bag with both ends of it opened.  There was nothing in this supposed real footage to lead a rational mind to believe there was anything strange or unexplained going on out there in the woods. <br/><br/>That three people could wander off into the woods, get lost, place the blame on each other, and begin seeing things which weren't there (nothing showed up on the film) is believable enough.  I believe what really happened is these three shot the video and film and left the video and film in the woods where an accomplice could find it.  Then playing on the old Blair Witch stories and their own staged disappearance (remember no one was able to find any trace of them, their camping gear or cameras) the video and film were sold to the movie makers and at last count this  no budget movie had made over $30M!"

"casper-27","Null","0","1","2 August 1999"," ridiculously stupid film
","After much bally-hoo, the film opened to a standing room only crowd at an Arts Theater in South Toledo.  The beginning of the movie lived up to its hype - herky-jerky, black-and-white, and sometimes out of focus, film shot by ""rented"" cameras - unfortunately, this is where the entire movie remained: in the cheap rent district!  This movie fails to titillate, let alone shock the senses.  The crowd was probably 80% of the 17 to 22 years of age group with older people filling the void.  To get a true measure of a movie's fright factor one needs only to count the number of ""snuggles"" seen throughout the audience.  This is when a young and innocent female buries her face in the shoulder of her date while screaming at a fevers pitch. This movie produced zero screams, zero snuggle opportunities and absolutely no one hiding from what was happening on the screen.  I did see a score or two of people yawning with boredom (admittedly, I was guilty of this reflex action on several occasions).  The movie was a joke!  The ending was as predictable as the sun rising in the east each and every morning.  I watched small children (with their parents)exchanging laughs and jokes as they departed the movie theater and somehow knew there would not be any ""nightmares"" in that household.  The film hasn't any of the absolute ""fear driven quality"" the original Halloween had, and Witch can't even hold a candle to An American Werewolf in London or something as simple as the ""step-and-slide acting of The Mummy (1938?).  Save your time, and your money, and rent something from the video store.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 - 10, I give this film a 2!"
"Primal-2","1","0","2","2 August 1999"," The Scariest Film Ever... I DON'T THINK SO!
","""The Scariest Film Ever""...I don't think so!<br/><br/>I walked into the movie theater feeling that I had actually spent my money well for once, but I left feeling more ripped off than I had in my entire life!<br/><br/>WARNING:  This film is not the slightest bit scary!<br/><br/>The only thing I actually liked about the movie, and the only thing that will save it was the acting!  The three actors in the film give one of the most realistic performances I've ever seen in a movie.  Yes, some of the things they do are just flat out stupid, but the dialogue between the three of them is excellent.  If it wasn't for the chemistry, or lack there of, between these characters this film wouldn't be worth putting in theaters at all.  <br/><br/>As I said before, the acting was the only thing I enjoyed about this film. Simply put, the rest of the movie was terrible. There was nothing in the movie that was really scary.  As a matter of fact, I wasn't frightened for a second.  Don't get me wrong.  I went to this movie wanting to see a really scary movie, but the film just didn't deliver!  That's really my main problem with this movie, it just isn't scary, and that's what it was pawned off on everyone to be.  <br/><br/>Another problem with the movie was the camera work.  Yes, it was cool to present the film as clips from the cameras they we're using, but the camera work was enough to make you sick.  BOUNCE, BOUNCE, BOUNCE.  It was almost more annoying than it was effective.  Along with the picture bouncing all over creation, I thought the lack of music throughout the movie was a bad idea.  Music adds a great deal to any movie, especially horror movie.<br/><br/>
My final problem with the movie is the lack of common sense. I know there isn't very much common sense to any horror movie, but let's think about a few thing here.  One, how long can a battery in a video camera last? Honestly I don't know, but three or four days plus seems to be pushing it without a good re-charging.  Two,  why would you continue to stop and sleep if you know something is after you?  You might as well just walk away from your friends and say, ""I'll be right back.""  I thought most college students were suppose to be smart.  I guess being smart has nothing to do with common sense.  Three, why wouldn't you just follow the that you ran into on five different occasions?  Everyone knows that if you follow water down stream it eventually comes out someplace, and that beats being lost in a woods any day.  The move just didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film just didn't do much for me.  It wasn't that scary, and the characters weren't very bright.  For me the only thing that saved the film was the acting!  <br/><br/>I can only give it 4 out of 10 stars.  And that's simply for great acting."

","This film ranks among the dumbest I've seen, and it's outright ridiculous to compare it to the work of Hitchcock in suspense or fright.  But beyond that, are we to believe that these young adults didn't have the sense to go in one direction... they had a bright sun to guide them... or that it took them over three days to find their way out of a woods that only took them less than a day to enter.  The young woman, in fact, tells us that she spends her Sundays hiking through the woods near her home for enjoyment... yet she never learned to follow water downstream, or on which side of the tree the moss is on?  Besides that goof, there are many times when it would be ridiculous that anyone would be video recording what was going on, and there are also times when the camera catches all of the characters, one after another... so who's doing the filming?

","Don't believe the hyperbole: this is a resourceful, effective and bold scare movie, but it is far from original.  The narrative conceit of this film is lifted whole-hog from Ruggero Deodato's notorious Cannibal Holocaust (1979). Astute cinema aficionados will recall that film's similar but entirely more convincing and properly established recovered-documentary-footage-of-film-crew-lost-in-the-wild motif.  The promotional campaign tactics (which are, of course, contributing much to the film's effect) are a subtle reworking of the scare-em-before-they're-even-inside-the-theater technique immortalized by the great William (13 Ghosts, Homicidal, The Tingler, et al) Castle.<br/><br/>TBWP is intermittently nerve-racking, unpredictable, and surprising, but is badly marred by unjudicious pacing, an unsustained mood and some nagging technical oversights (read: slick sound mixing, over-precise editing) that will likely un-suspend the knowing viewer's suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>That being said, it's nice to see ultra-low-budget scare movies back in the theaters where they belong."

The combination of three young student film-makers with the suggestion of promising personalities and a potential for complex interactions plus a ghost legend and a goal of making a documentary -- this could lead to a quality movie experience.  However, that quickly dissolved into a very LONG and tedious collection of amateur photography accentuated by unimaginative and annoying dialogue. And where was the scary part the hype was all about?  After all, camping in the Maryland woods is not fraught with grizzly bears and other dangerous critters.  There was so much space between the trees and open level ground that even a psychopathic killer doesn't present a terrific threat.  The frustration was watching three not very intelligent people manage to act like idiots in the great outdoors.  To an experienced camper and outdoorsperson, this was intolerable.  Why was it, they never really start to get out of the now frightening area until an hour before sun down?  Why is it, they are falling apart psychologically after only two nights outdoors?  Why are they falling apart psychologically at all?  Why do they have to resort to bellowing and slamming things around? Why don't they follow the stream to get out?  Is all this lack of outdoors competence supposed to be explained by some sort of bewitched state of mind? Is going around in circles part of the evil spell?  And who the heck is stupid enough to go into an abandoned house with eerie symbols painted all over it when you're already terrified of bad things happening?  It's that spell again, huh.  By the way, if this is supposed to take eight days ... where were the search and rescue planes and bloodhounds,  or were their parents just as glad to be rid of them as we were when the movie was over? The Maryland woods are neither huge, nor the epitome of wilderness.  We likened the experience to taking one of those haunted house rides in an amusement part -- where you rationally expect things to jump out at you throughout the ride, but instead, they just turn out the lights and you ride around in the dark until --- you're back outdoors again and the ride is over.  Admittedly -- it is scary because you were constantly expecting the worst.  But frankly, after getting back outside, you would reflect and say -- I paid money for that????   If the movie left us with anything it was with a standing joke about bunches of twigs wrapped with twine and blue gel toothpaste smeared all over."

I can't understand how you never run across any kind of sort of animal or snake or bird sounds in the woods for days. And always have lit cigarettes but no campfire to keep u warm at night. Being so scared out of your mind and someone is still filming the whole thing,being that scared filming it would be the last thing I would be thinking of.

Unfortunately, you probably won't find it, and if you did, the fake (human) and real (animal) butchery would definitely put you off. However, for the strong of stomach, that is a film that is not only disturbing in broad daylight, but also disturbs to instruct. Two things that The Blair Witch Project cannot claim for itself.<br/><br/>In short, if you've never gotten over your childhood fears and are still afraid of the dark, even just a little, under the right conditions, Blair Witch is for you.<br/><br/>Otherwise, skip it."

","Scary ? ha ha ha. This movie somehow generated hype, probably because it was offbeat. That is all that can be said about it. The frenzied and jittery camera movements (to simulate a documentary) creates a certain sickening effect. The characters are moronic, the realization is ineffective, the storyline is nonexistent and the overall effect is just intolerable. Just because a movie is offbeat does not make it good.

I mean, that's the basic outline of the film, but, to me, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was more of a survive-in-the-middle-of-nowhere, distinctly amateurish indie flick.<br/><br/>We never really get to know the three college kids (unless you count their foul-mouthed comments and antics as character development). And, come on, as a member of the so-called ""Generation X"" group of kids, would we really stand around and drool whenever we found out that there was no way out of here and that we were going to die? I don't think so. I think we would've put up a fight. We might not have won, but we would have certainly died trying.<br/><br/>In short, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is sometimes eerie, but never scary.

","I hate to leave myself open to the charge of being a wet blanket, but I've waited in vain to see someone else point out that this movie may well disappoint those who, like myself, had their expectations raised out of all proportion by the tremendous hype.  I'll say first off that BWP is well made, with convincing performances and a truly terrifying last 2-3 minutes. Otherwise, I found it a disappointment.<br/><br/>Because so many reviews have hailed this as a deeply terrifying movie, I was actually afraid to go see it, being something of a wimp.  I need not have worried:  the film is tense, yes, even unpleasantly so, but the characters were not likeable enough to inspire great concern on my part, and the incidents that should have been frightening merely inspired interest and mild curiosity.  <br/><br/>The one judicious use of gore was genuinely creepy and well executed (as it were), and, as I've mentioned, the final sequence is deeply scary. I think, though, that the much-lauded absence of Hollywood fakery actually worked against this film's effectiveness with me.  The hand-held cameras actually made the entire film seem more artificial instead of more realistic, so that I was constantly aware that this was, indeed, only a film.  This is a shame, since the situation is so promising and truly ought to have given me the shivers.  <br/><br/>I offer my experience not to put down the many who have found the film everything it's cracked up to be, but only to suggest that for some--not all--viewers, it may not live up to their expectations.

","I have not seen such original backstory and hype since Twin Peaks.  But unlike Twin Peaks, BWP does not execute (except the characters, but that's a different execution).  Essentially, the two behind this film are hardly filmmakers in a professional sense.  Read any film making book, attend any seminar, even if you focus on an independent audience, these guys break all the rules.  And breaking the rules is not innovative.  The MTV-like jumpy camera shots and angles may work for videos, but they do not work for film. (This is the only movie I have ever seen where fellow film goers came out dizzy and ill as if suffering from motion sickness.)<br/><br/>If I were to attach a 16 mm camera to the back of a Rottweiler (big, scary dog) for a day, I will most likely end up with the same technical quality, and arguably a much better story.  And can I please have one character I can sympathize with?  Of all the true stories I have heard of people lost in the woods, I can't recall the part where the lost people had survival tips of (1) cuss at everybody in your party all day (2) shove video camera in everyone's face.<br/><br/>As said earlier, the backstory is great, the premise is great, but the film itself is not scary.  Fear of the unknown is one of the scariest, well executed by ALIEN, but miserably done here.  I think the filmmakers tried so hard to fulfill the backstory, they were too successful.  Home movies are not interesting.  Even in an independent, low-budget film, horrible sound, horrible writing, horrible acting, and horrible directing does not somehow evolve into a good film.  The true talent is in the marketing, whomever did that has a future, as for the filmmakers, well....good luck."

However, watching the three ""break down"" and argue in between those moments starts to wear thin after the second day of filming.<br/><br/>It's not as riveting as the hype would lead you to believe, nor is it as ""original"" or ""groundbreaking"" as I had hoped.  Most of the time I was sitting there feeling like I was just watching some inconsequential home movies that led nowhere.

For one, it offers an original and clever ghost story, with the filmmakers capturing among the most genuine emotions I've ever seen in characters. Elements such as fear, confusion, hunger and frustration were portrayed with unrivaled authenticity. However, while the trio on screen might have been scared, never at one point of the movie was I even the slightest bit frightened. Not the slightest bit. I kept waiting to be terrified and it never happened. I guess I don't have issues with the filmmakers as much as the hype and reviews surrounding the movie. I cannot recall how many reviews I've read featuring bold statements such as ""one of the scariest movies ever made."" I mean come on, the trailer for ""Baby Geniuses"" was scarier than Blair Witch.

Compared to recent remake of The Haunting, Blair Witch is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Yet as I said, as entertainment BWP is only passable.  It is a repetitive bore, with a few scary scenes near the end.  The final moments leave a LOT to be desired.  A lot of people complain about gore in horror movies, but here it would have helped.  Without it, the movie seemed like just a bunch of kids running about in the woods trying to make a scary movie.  If we had actually seen, say, a glimpse of Josh, it would have worked wonders for the movie.  I also did not like the use of the second camera, as at the end we are not seeing the actual footage, but edited footage to heighten tension. Considering the movie is desperately trying to be realistic, this completely shattered the believability of the last scene.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the sound effects could have been equalized or something to make them more audible.  This is supposed to be realistic, but so much so that the audience can barely hear the sounds.  As it is, the sounds of Josh in the distance are drowned out by the footsteps and breathing of the other actors.<br/><br/>Sadly, the audience I saw this with did NOT like the movie.  The film makers tried hard, but ultimately their low budget and unwillingness to use some special effects hurt the movie.  It might have made them money.  That is another story.  The Haunting made 33 million on openeing weekend.  What does that tell you?  These movies are all hype folks; the true judgement is what you thought of it yourself, how it made *you* feel.<br/><br/>Heather Donahue could be in line for an Oscar nom with this one, even though the 'script' was overdone.  Despite this, she did great in her part.<br/><br/>In the end, I don't know how this movie got so hyped, or got so many great reviews.  This is definitely not the most original movie I have seen, either.  Cannibal Holocaust, for instance, was in the same vein, and more disturbing.  I guess audiences have been craving a good horror fix, and nothing has come along for a long time as good as Blair Witch."

Although I was on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, ""it"" never really happenned, and what I was left with was disappointment, and nausea, not from being disturbed or scared, but rather from the annoying camerawork to give it the faux-documentary look. In many horror films, you find yourself screaming to the screen, ""Don't go down there!"" or ""Watch out behind you!"" In this case, you find yourself asking, ""How is that possible that you are so stupid?"" or ""When is someone going to die?"" This is partly due to the fact that the characters are a little annoying, so you have no sympathy. And second, they really are THAT stupid. (How can you manage to navigate yourself in a complete circle hiking all day, if you plan to just go south?? Can't you just use the sun?)<br/><br/>On the upswing, there are some images which are very creepy, ones that would give you nightmares. But, it's not enough to make this film work. My vote: 3/10"

","All right, I'll tell you what IS scary.  What's scary is that this movie is doing so well in the box office--hopefully, after all the suckers who bought the hype see this movie, they'll tell their friends what a yawner it really was and the sales will drop off.  Luckily, I saw this movie for free at a sneak preview a few months ago, and I foolishly thought then that interest would drop off and we wouldn't have to deal with yet another gimmicky movie making a ridiculous amount of money and sinking the film industry further into the mire it has been festering in for the last twenty years. <br/><br/>Look, guys, the movie isn't scary.  We the audience don't hear the things go bump in the night, or get any sense of the darkness of the woods--it is simply relayed to us by our frantic trio of pre-adults, as is all the vital information in this film.  ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great ghost story--that is, a story you read or hear.  But film is a VISUAL medium, relying on what you see or, as effectively, don't see.  This movie chooses neither of these paths--instead, we play witness to 80-some minutes of talking, talking, talking by actors who don't have the benefit of a script. Sure, they are scared; sure, they fight.  But so do the nimrods on Jerry Springer, and you don't see anyone being kept up at night by that drivel. <br/><br/>I don't quite know what is so terrifying about this flick.  The characters walk around taping trees, get scared over a bunch of sticks (among other things, all of which can be categorized as ""meaningless objects meant to scare you"") and mostly waste their breath arguing about nothing.  True, the last five minutes are pretty dang jittery, I'll admit I got the heebie-jeebies--but when's the last time it was worth 8 bucks for five minutes of belated, schlocky entertainment? So wait for the video, rent it for your kids, along with other classics like ""Urban Legend"" and ""Disturbing Behavior.""  those are all cute little fright flicks, mutant afterbirths of that mother of neo-horror, Scream.  But please don't do truly gut-renching cinema the dishonor of worshipping ""The Blair Witch Project"" as something special.  Read a frickin' book instead."

","The beginning was kind of cute, and the end was okay, but that doesn't justify the long implausible episode of The Real World that we got in the middle.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film, and I was really careful that my reaction would not be a backlash against the hype.  I am pretty willing to suspend my disbelief for most things (like, I didn't even question if the house in The People Under The Stairs was plausible).  But I just couldn't make the leap for the Blair Witch Project.  I think that it was the premise that ultimately made it fail.<br/><br/>Because the characters in the BWP spent so much time and effort taping themselves react to things, at no time could I really believe that they were all that scared.  I mean, if you were scared out of your wits, would you be peering cockeyed through a viewfinder, or would you use both eyes to look around?<br/><br/>Ah, but then, we wouldn't have a movie, would we?<br/><br/>The result is some unbelievable overreactions caught on tape and some eye-rolling situations, which made the entire movie as believable as an episode of Jerry Springer.  It was as if the emotions were overplayed just for the camera or for a drama improvisation class.  And, despite the ""innovative"" way of telling the story, that conceit, as realized by those actors, made the situation too implausible to be truly frightening.<br/><br/>Don't take the comparisons to Jerry Springer and the Real World to mean that this movie is bad.  It's just that despite all the efforts to make the terror seem real, the BWP just fails to be genuine and believable."

"Rider11","3","0","2","26 July 1999"," Don't Buy the Hype!
","There's a reason that almost every company in town passed on ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- it's a very interesting idea that quickly runs out of steam and is technically demanding and artistically frustrating.  There's no question there's some imagination here, but the constant hand-held camera (which offers very little in the way of style or narrative information until the very end) is nauseating and the acting ranges from tepid to simply awful.<br/><br/>If you've read all of the hype and ""stories"" about the making of the film, you know everything you need to know.  If the filmmakers had either better technical ability or a stronger hand with the actors, this may have been a more successful and even spookier endeavor.  As it is, the ""improvising"" actors have little to do for most of the film except swear profusely at each other and run around in darkness.  The ""spooky sounds"" they hear are poorly mixed, and the audience is given such sketchy information on the exact myth of the ""Blair Witch"" that it's not even clear what these kids are supposed to be afraid of. <br/><br/>The real weakness of the film is the acting, which in spite of best efforts by ""Josh"" and ""Mike,"" is hampered by the constant whining of ""Heather,"" who seems inept as a documentarian.  None of these characters seem real even on a satiric level -- they are ciphers from the get-go and have no emotional depth.  As frightful as their ""lost in the woods"" story may be, the performers obviously lack the chops necessary to sustain the fact that there is no real story.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch"" is little more than a failed cinematic exercise:  one wishes the filmmakers would have used their first effort as a calling card to re-make the same story with a stronger stylistic hand, modestly increased budget and better-prepared actors.  The reaction from most of the crowd in the full house I saw it with was mostly, ""Is that it?"" and there was hissing and booing at the end of the film.  The folks at Artisan should be credited for getting the most out of their limited run engagement, but this is unquestionably a film that will be better on video, late at night, long after everyone has forgotten that this is supposed to be ""the scariest movie ever"" or some such nonsense."

","I went with some friends to go see the Blair Witch Project on Sunday and my hopes of a scary thriller were set high. The online and just the all around buzz was good and it seemed like everyone was talking about it. I didn't know anyone who saw it because of the limited release of the film. Some friends who went to see it before were turned away due to sold out shows. When the movie started you are introduced to the characters as they pack for their trip. Right away I will warn you that this WHOLE movie is filmed with an 8mm camera and even if you don't get motion sickness you just might start when you watch this documentary. There was never a scary moment and there was only a scene or two that even hinted at suspense. I would recommend waiting for this to come out on video, but if you must see it then bring some Dramamene and be prepared to look away from the screen several times before you get nauseous from watching the camera bounce around the whole time. The only thing that scared my friends and I was the thought of throwing up in the theater from being so dizzy and light headed. I can't see how anyone could say this was scary. To even compare this to The Exorcist is idiotic. I have seen Twilight Zone episodes that were scarier than this.

Yes, all that's cool....<br/><br/>But the best horror movie ever?  C'mon!!  This movie was in no way, shape or form the best horror movie ever.  Scary?

Fright has never had anything to do with cgi graphics; but the fear of the unknown.

Blair Witch was sorely lacking the frightening punch that so many had promised."
"NEUROTIC-2","Null","0","1","24 July 1999"," Horror film...? More like a comedy to me!
","Let me begin by stating that no one could have been more intrigued by this concept of ""mock documentary"" in horror than myself. I've seen that special on the Sci-Fi channel that brilliantly sets the stage for screening the film. It truly gave you a sense of foreboding history and got you acquainted with a mysterious lore lurking in the Black Hills Forest in Maryland. Unfortunately, that Sci-Fi special (part of the whole PR campaign) was far scarier than the actual film.<br/><br/>I saw Blair Witch in a packed house that was filled up nearly 40 minutes before the show started, which is how anxious everyone around here was about wanting to see this and be terrified beyond belief. We all apparently bought the hype and our expectations were just too high perhaps. Whatever the reason, Blair Witch seemed nothing more to me than a corny episode of the Real World - Lost in the Woods. The film had so many funny moments and the audience laughed out loud so many times, you would have thought you were at a Jim Carey flick. Not a single scream was heard in our theater for the entire film. Personally, I grew tired of listening to the three of them complain and yell at each other about whether anyone knew where the hell they were going and what would happen once they got there. I suppose it showed realism there as I'm sure friends lost in the woods, growing more tired and hungry and agitated by the minute, would be behaving in exactly the same way. It just seemed that I was waiting for the scary moments to occur and they just didn't. I'm sorry, but constructed stick figures and rock piles along the journey, did not scare me in the least. I knew you had to tap into the emotions of the characters as they appeared to be followed and hunted by some unknown forces, but it just didn't translate well from those 8MM cameras, poor sound quality, and sub-par filming by the actual actors. There were some stretches where the audience was staring at a black screen with only the sounds of breathing and cursing going on. It just didn't cut it with me.<br/><br/>I must say that the last 5 minutes were truly intense to experience and the ending is a shocker that really sends you reeling out of the theater. Trouble is, you have to sit through the first 83 minutes to get there. To put it simply, the beginning got you off to a good start, the rising action was okay, the entire middle SUCKED until the last 5 minutes. I would not recommend seeing Blair Witch, especially if you prefer some horror in your horror movies. Just watch the Sci-Fi channel special and you'll be more frightened in the comfort of your own living room."

Heather does becomes much more hysterical as the film goes on, but much to the audience's annoyance than much else. Mere attempts to shake the camera simply isn't enough to generate atmosphere.<br/><br/>I know some people loved the film: but let's face it, very little people have yet the chance to see it for themselves.

"Swampfox","Null","0","1","24 July 1999"," DO NOT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM OR IT WILL DISAPPOINT
","That said, I have to say I was disappointed. On the day when the public finally got to see the year's most anticipated ""serious"" film from a dead director, I was anticipating the scariest film about the dead. In other words, this was a film I wanted to like, wanted to get sucked in to and wanted to have scare the bejeezus out of me. When the lights came up after finally seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I found I only liked the first half, was only sucked in occasionally and never once felt anything than some mild creepiness.<br/><br/>All those clamoring about the film on the internet may or no be real (there's talk in the entertainment industry that much the buzz was planted by the distributor), but the initial reaction at film festivals last winter was undoubtedly uncoached. Thinking that this 80 minute mixed media movie is real would probably make most viewer's skin crawl. But once that cat's out of the bag (and even the most cursory glance at articles about this film give that away), the big gimmick  turns out to be the biggest thing going for it. Not the only thing, but it can't drive the film anymore once a viewer is no longer scammed into thinking the ""In 1994 three student filmmakers went into..."" is on the level.<br/><br/>All the shots used in promotional stories about ""The Blair Witch Project"" are not used in the actual film. It begins with the same preamble that adorns the poster and ad copy. This is a mistake, as it shows a lack of foresight on the filmmakers' part. They should have realized that only the first audience would benefit from complete ignorance, the rest of us might need a sequence that builds the idea that what we are seeing is real. The distributor is obviously trying to sustain the illusion: at my screening a booklet proclaiming itself as the Blair Witch Dossier was given to us in line. Inside are notes from fictitious private investigators and class statements written by the ""missing filmmakers."" If only this had been included in the movie.<br/><br/>The most impressive thing about the film (after the chutzpah of its filmmakers) is the improvisation of the actors. There are scenes that rang so true that I will not be surprised next winter if one of the endless series of awards given out goes to one of the three faux documentarians. One scene that starts with gallows humor and ends in near fisticuffs affirmed that those magical moments of theater or recorded acting can still pull us out of our seats. On the basis of it alone I can see why the uninformed would take the events at face value.<br/><br/>As with most, ""Blair Witch's"" undoing is its last act. As events unfold, the filmmakers repeatedly squander the tension that has gripped the audience. Perhaps a little too attuned to the aesthetics of the documentary-within-a-film they have created, they let its sensibilities guide how they shape the events of the last 20 minutes. Too much of the ""found"" footage is allowed to unreel, losing the dramatic build-up. And after all this overage, the ending is abrupt and confusing. There isn't a single back story to the legend of the Blair Witch but three, which undermines the payoff. We never see anything of the ""presence"" that is pursuing them through the woods, so it's hard to even begin to debate if it is supernatural or not. If not for a friend seeing it with me, I'm not sure how long it would have been before I ""got"" the ending."

","The Blair Witch Project only works if you believe it's real. It's an experiment not only in film, but more importantly in marketing and promotion. I knew a lot of people who truly believed that what they were watching was real footage. The Blair Witch Project is only scary on that level. Otherwise, it's a jumpy, obnoxious experiment into the gullible nature of todays society. I personally found it annoying, but then again, I never thought it was real. The only scary thing about the film is the amount of uninformed idiots there are walking around who will believe anything they hear. I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this film as a work of fiction. The audience was cheated out of their money by clever promotion. Who knows, this could be the movie of the future.

","Sure there are those who are going to complain about what appears to be home movie quality film being pushed as a major motion picture.  There also are those who will claim the movie is not ""scary"" because it never shows what exactly is chasing/stalking the three students.  These type have missed the whole concept of the film.  The purpose is to confuse and disorient the viewer while showing the characters slowly breaking down into exhaustive fear.  The audience is never fully sure of what is happening and only sees a limited bit of the story through the lens of a camera focused as a point of view from whoever happens to be holding it at the time.  The audience is left with more questions than answers, but that seems to be the intent of the producers.<br/><br/>It is the disorientation and limited visual information that help bring on the fear factor of the story.  The plot alone is weak, the dialogue is nothing special (it does appear to have been made up as the actors went along) and the cinematography is poor considering only the cameras' mounted lights or natural sun light were used.<br/><br/>This movie works, though."

It could be anyone, anyone that walks into a place outside where they should go, that gets in a situation like these 3 did.

The actors do a very good job progressing from film school students to terrified kids who just want to crawl back into the womb.<br/><br/>However, the characters seem unbelievably stupid at times (similar to most films within the genre), and the fact that there always is at least one camera rolling, day or night, whenever something scary happens is a bit hard to swallow.  The ending, which I won't ruin here, would have been much more affecting for me if the fact that throughout the scene, the characters never took their eyes from the viewfinders on their video cameras hadn't seemed so ludicrous.<br/><br/>Still, it's a no-budget classic and a lot of people are going to be way more freaked out than I was.

","First of all, I have to say that BWP is a milestone in the movie industry. To compare it with Citizen Kane is probably too much, but they have at least one similarity: both has been claimed to have invented new concepts in moviemaking, both are not that original. Many techniques credited to Kane as it being the first film to use them have been used in other movies before. BWP, too, is not very original in the idea, because The Last Broadcast precedes it by a year. For some reason, though (I suspect wrong marketing strategy), TLB never came to be known so widely as BWP, and so people say BWP is a pioneering movie.<br/><br/>Now about the ending, I would have to warn for spoilers here because you're not going to see what you expect to see. The movie has developed fear from the beginning by not doing what most other horror movies normally do: show the monster.

The premise of the movie is simple enough: Three students go into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch and end up wishing they hadn't.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" takes the approach that what's scariest is what our imaginations can conjure up (though this is of course a result of it's budget of about $20,000). We never see anything as such - a pile of stones doesn't exactly inspire fear but how they got there is (what's meant to) create the terror. The hounded feel is compounded by the use of the hand held camera to bring us into what Heather & co. are seeing - we never know any more than they do. We're with them until the end.<br/><br/>Does any of it work? To an extent. As a one-off-no-lights-on experience it can be eerie for the reasons I've described. The use of unknown actors - who were themselves ""scared"" during filming to add authenticity - helps add to the ""reality"" of this being lost footage. On a second viewing the flaws become apparent - there's no plot for example. That's fine for a one-time viewing but a movie should stand up to repeated viewing. The direction is obviously not really there - they just fling the camera about as they're running around and the ""actors"" are not camera people.<br/><br/>
It's hard to judge ""The Blair Witch Project"". Certainly it's different. Different enough to be good is had to say.

"garlick","9","0","2","18 November 2001"," scary, more eerie
","Seeing ""Blair Witch"" again after a few years, I found it easier to view it on its own merits.<br/><br/>Quick synopsis:  three students hike into the middle of nowhere to make a documentary on a piece of local folklore.  They become hopelessly, desperately lost.  The realization of how screwed they are slowly sets in as they begin to suspect that they are being stalked by something sinister and unseen.  The film itself presents itself as the doomed student's own video footage of their documentary.<br/><br/>The primary factor is to keep in mind the difference between ""horror"" and ""terror.""  ""Terror"" is sudden, blood-soaked threats of bodily harm that jump out at the heroes, and unfortunately is all most ""horror movies"" deliver. ""Horror"" is dread of unseen and horrid possibilities, carefully cultivated by a thoughtfully-crafted situation.  ""Blair Witch"" is rich in horror.  It has some terror but it's fairly lean and carefully employed.  This may disappoint some viewers, especially if they have very high expectations and/or are accustomed to schlock.  If you want to see a movie starring a special effect, look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Blair Witch"" does have a long build-up, but it does reward those who pay attention through the first quarter of the film.  It will provide you with the depth of the story that is not explicitly laid out for the viewer later.  Most importantly, it does become more creepy in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>The jiggling camera is somewhat dis-orienting in parts, but is put to good use in drawing the viewer into frantic and confusing scenes.  Also, the film might have less impact on you if you feel very at home in the woods, or if you have little sympathy for the characters.  Horror is, after all, subjective.<br/><br/>There are several scenes which are overtly scary, and still made me jump. However, the best part of the movie is the strong build-up from frustration to desperation, from desperation to dread, and from dread to screaming panic.  When the credits roll you'll be left with the adrenaline of the high-energy scenes.  A while later, it's the eerie implications of the build up to those scenes that sinks in...  Usually late at night, when you're by yourself.  Now that's horror.<br/><br/>Regretfully, ""Blair Witch"" is an experiment that shines in its original concepts, but lags in some of its delivery.  If you can tolerate the actors and cope with some dragging pace, you'll find it a refreshing take on the genre."

The highlight of the film is watching the flashlight flail around in the darkness, in the middle of the night, miles away from nowhere. You are ready for Heather's powerful flashlight to bounce off of...anything and everything. When it doesn't happen, you go slightly crazy with anticipation. I suspect that folks who didn't like the film, would have to admit that, but only if painted into a corner.<br/><br/>But arguing with people and trying to make them like the film, would be ungracious and would miss the point.

","I totally skipped this two years ago when it first came out, based on the (first) super positive buzz and (second) on the following super negative buzz. Anything that's so hyper-exposed is something I generally don't have interest in.<br/><br/>SO, when I caught the flick on the idiot box the other night, I was genuinely surprised at how effective the film was at fulfilling it's relatively modest goals with so little in the way of standard movie making ""stuff""...like props, sets, a script, FX, decent sound; really, like the stuff you get with even a modest budget.<br/><br/>Understanding that the film had a 20G budget and was basically made by the three actors themselves with no script (in fact nothing but their backpacks and film and camping gear), I believe the performances and gradual and effective building of suspense was remarkable. None of the characters is particularly likeable, but they're also not in any way two-dimensional or unbelievable. They're real people, an effect of the film being largely ad-libbed along the way, with a minimum of guidance by the producers in the form of notes left at the campsite every morning.<br/><br/>Sure there was stuff in the performances that didn't quite hit the mark (I would give an example but don't want to be accused of ""spoiling""), but those that focus on the imperfections are missing the point: this is a film that makes a goal of examining our most basic, animal fears; the frehman year of college ghost stories or the ""monsters in the closet"" that we've all at one time or another experienced and had some kind of reaction to.

"kittycat5","Null","0","1","16 October 2001"," The best horror movie I have ever seen
","I am a big fan of horror movies and I'm not easily scared but this movie scared me.  For starters, it looks so real.  Theres no phony fake effects and theres no computer generated images (Cgi).  CGIs, though they may be good, can easily be distinguished from real images.  Not only does it look real almost everywhere you look (for example, the web site) there's something trying to convince you that it is real.  In fact many people function under the misconception that it is real.  There was no script so the dialogue and actions were those of the actors.  They literally went out into the woods and the producers and crew harassed them.  You can visibly see the break down of humanity among them.  The complained about jerky camera movements are like that because these people aren't professional camera people.  They did just what anyone else would do when they got chased while holding a camera.  They ran and didn't bother to keep it perfectly steady.  The legend is very intricate, there's even a video that you can rent that discusses the legend as if it were true.  I also have the video games which, believe it or not, furthers the legend.  Another thing that makes the movie so scary is that you never see what's doing it.  There's n o monster to attack, no psychotic that you can see.  Whatever it is it can be anywhere.  It's all around you, you're lost in the woods with no one to help you and no way to protect yourself.  That was the scariest thing about it, that you never knew where it was.  It could've been coming at them from anywhere and it has the power to kill you.  And it wants to kill you. Rent it, or better yet buy it.  You won't regret it."

"The_Biggish_Lebowski","Null","0","1","12 October 2001"," AFFECTING AND INFECTIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR
","I honestly don't know if I'm grateful or not to have been blessed with an active imagination.  On the one hand I am because it allowed me to make the most of this truly horrifying movie.  But on the other hand, it very nearly induced a cardiac arrest by the time the final reel rolled!!  So many `horror' movies are a disappointment and leave me totally cold because they have the false belief that to have someone suddenly jump into frame from off-screen will shock you (the one exception that jumps to mind being The Shining, where Jack Nicholson's character emerges, completely unexpectedly, from behind a pillar to bury an axe in the chest of his victim).  But the truth is that this, and other techniques generally employed by these films, have been done to death and are actually anticipated by the audience - hardly in keeping with a `surprise'.  However, The Blair Witch Project is a welcome exception to this stultifyingly mundane genre as it relies entirely upon psychological horror.  I had heard the hype and knew the supposed reality of the story to have been contrived, but unlike most people in this situation still managed to be totally drawn in once it got underway.  The shaky hand-held camera, complete lack of a music and amateur level of production hitting just the right note to suggest it's authenticity.  In what has to be one of the most ominous opening lines to any movie:  `In October of 1994, three student film makers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary....'  you're then hit (after a suitable delay) with the payoff line:  `.... a year later their footage was found'.  That impregnates all sorts of scenarios in you mind before we've even met the characters in question.<br/><br/>The horror at first is subtle (anonymous noises out of the dead of night - quickly written off as deer or owls) yet you feel relieved to see the screen flood with daylight.  However, it's severity builds along with the tension and despair within the characters as we see their fear come full circle. It taps into most peoples base fear of the unknown and the dark, and as such invokes a far more primal fear than a psycho in a hockey mask or a razor-fingered figment of someone's imagination (!).  There are no `shock moments' or blood & guts so anyone who needs to behold their horror up on the screen is in for a big disappointment.  Nothing is shown and everything is suggested - the directors opting to credit the intelligence of their audience rather than patronising them.  They give you a loose thread and let your mind pick away at it, meaning that anyone with an active imagination is ultimately responsible for the intensity of their own fear.  The ambiguity of the film - particularly in it's end sequence - ensures this and means that it will stay with you for a considerable time after the movie has finished.<br/><br/>The acting of the main trio is quite superb and sincere to the point that you wonder if they are acting (indeed, the direction techniques employed literally left the cast lost in the woods, cold and with ever-decreasing supplies).  The decay of the group morale is palpable - at first refusing to accept the situation and finally succumbing to it's inevitability.  And the emotions on display - hysteria to paranoia - befit the evolution of their predicament perfectly.  Yes, Heather's voice grates (as so many of you have pointed out elsewhere in this page) but all is forgiven for her genuine display of sheer terror.  The scene in which she makes her peace with the camera, apologising to the parents of all three for her selfishness, is a testament to her acting talents.  And the realisation of her party's fate (looking straight into the camera: `We're gonna die out her') is simultaneously heart-breaking and chilling in it's starkness.  *SPOILER* The final scene, which switches between black-and-white (Heather) and colour (Mike) camera shots, is the most terrifying piece of cinema I have ever witnessed.  It is a true crescendo horror and left my palms sweating and my heart jack-hammering in my chest.  And the way that the sound of Heather's screams is recorded in the basement, yet we see her P.O.V. coming down from the first floor to the basement (so it sounds as though she's running upon herself) is a great inventive touch *END SPOILER*  When I first saw it at the cinema, I left the auditorium with that feeling as though I had been the victim.<br/><br/>This is very much a film that you either love or hate, depending on your preference for horror movies.  With the exception of The Shining, I can honestly say that every film of this genre I have ever sat through has left me totally unfulfilled and bored (which, incidentally, is something sceptics of BWP complain it induces).  If you're of the same opinion and bored by the lack of inventiveness in modern horror movies, this could be the exception to the rule.  If you have yet to see this movie, I ask that you drop any preconceptions that you may harbour.  Simply sit back and allow your imagination to run riot.  On the other hand, if you don't have an imagination..... stick to Evil Dead, Scream, Friday 13th etc, etc. Speaking of which, I'm starting to feel tired.... zzzzz.... zzzz....zzz....zz.... z."

This is perhaps the number one goal for any film which wants to scare you. I give it a conservative 7 out of 10.

","According to other user comments on Blair Witch Project this film has to be a really impressing experience with a unique atmospheric. I did see the movie, too, but I somehow feel like not being able to rate it. I have seen the version which is in German language and all I can say is: if you are going to watch Blair Witch Project, you should not see a dubbed version. The German speakers could not transfer the atmosphere from the original, it just isn´t that impressive seeing someone crying from fear and it is not the actor´s voice. Apart from that the story is on average level and the characters seem to be a little bit...let me say ""stupid"", even after days they act like: ""...Where to go now ? We´ll see, just let us go into any direction..."" I mean in recent history there has been something invented called ""mobile phone"".

","One thing I should mention beforehand: I was really impressed by the makers of the film and how they managed to sell the movie to the extent they did, given that it's really not a professional, or even usual type of movie. Apart from that, nothing works in the film, except for the actors who generally did a good job.<br/><br/>/*possible spoilers*/ While I can just about accept American teenagers of whom noone has a mobile phone, given that the movie does play early in the nineties, I certainly cannot accept people on an expedition throwing away their maps (that really was very very cheap as a twist). Furthermore, what do you do when you're lost in the woods and come across a river? Correct - you follow the river downstream. It's an easy way out if you've lost all other means of orientation. There is some basic stuff people going on expeditions like the one in BWP simply know and the plot should respect that. /*end possible spoilers*/<br/><br/>In the end, I found the film boring. The scary effects aren't really scary, the characters totally unconvincing in their actions (though the actors did their job well as I said). I guess the main problem was that I had really high expectations, given all the hype that's been going on about the film.

","They did a great job promoting the film(I read and enjoyed the Dossier , which filled me in on the legends of the Blair Witch, and had all sorts of interviews and 'police photos', adding to the documentary feel) and the idea of not ever really seeing exactly WHAT it was that tormented these people was an interesting touch, thus letting the viewer fill in and details the video cameras leave out. And the ending, though abrupt, fit in quite well. My praise for the film ends there. Maybe it was the fact that I made the mistake of watching it on the small screen with my mother (BAD IDEA!) who took it upon herself to comment on how disgusting the language was just about every other minute: that really distracts from the plot.

It is October in Maryland.  Thus at this time of year the dark lasts slightly longer than the light.

","Heather, Michael and Josh all head out into the woods to do a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interview some townspeople, get some background, and then go into the woods. What was supposed to be a weekend trip to film some footage turns into their worst nightmare. One year after they disappear, their footage is found, buried in an abandoned burned out house. <br/><br/>
The best thing about this movie is the ability to blend reality and fiction. There isn't a person in this country that hasn't heard of this movie, but how many people believe it's true? Did these three kids really disappear 5 years ago, or is this only make believe? From an impressive web site, to a special on the Sci-Fi Network, to just an amazing underground buzz, the line between truth and reality is blurred almost to the point of non-existence. Never has there been a movie with so much effort put into building a huge back-story leading into the actual film. Was there a Blair Witch? Was she really sent into the woods to die? Did children mysteriously disappear? Who killed 7 children in an old house? Is any of it real? <br/><br/>
Watching the film, you really felt like you were just watching a friends home movies (other than the fact that most friends home movies aren't edited and partly shot on 16mm black and white film). No steadicams, no special lighting, and most of the time, no script; just three kids out in the woods having the most terrifying time of their life. The movie showed, very well I might add, all three of them go from fun loving documentary artists, to three people slowly losing their minds. The movie builds very slowly to a very creepy and frightening climax. <br/><br/>
The buzz for Blair Witch has been astounding, and while mainstream American might be hoping for more after all the hype, this movie definitely has all the chills and thrills a good old-fashioned horror movie needs. No slashers with knives on their fingers, no one wearing a mask, just good mental horror. While it didn't completely live up to the hype, it was a great showcase for young, hardworking filmmakers to see how you can make a great film by having a good story, good young actors, and a belief that the movie you're making is going to be great."
"thrash_clown","Null","0","1","12 July 2001"," Why this film is better than most people give it credit.
","It's unfortunate to see that an imaginative and somewhat innovative film like this gets walked all over by so many people. It's unfortunate that most people seem to have missed the point.<br/><br/>The major criticism most people give regarding BWP is that it's ""not scary"" or that as a ""horror movie"" it fails. First off, these people should know the difference between a ""horror"" movie and a ""suspenseful"" movie. In a horror movie, we are scared because we don't know what will happen. In a suspense movie, we DO know what will happen, but we DO NOT know how or, more importantly, when the events will occur. This was NOT a scary movie, but it was extremely suspenseful, and that's where, I think, most people miss the point.<br/><br/>!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/>I thought this film did an excellent job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere. Everyone knew from the beginning that these kids would never be found, but we didn't know how this was going to happen. No one with any iota of intelligence should have been expecting monsters popping out of the woods or a psychotic killer wearing a hockey mask to leap from the shadows. We are with them as they set out, get lost, and disappear one by one. We are with them as they become more frantic to escape the forest, and as they become more terrified about whatever it is that is stalking them.<br/><br/>
To appreciate this film, you have to accept this film for the way it was intended: A collection of documentary footage which was ""found,"" showing the last traces of a bunch of adventurous filmmakers. In the age of ""reality"" tv shows, it is astounding that so many people dump on this film. Yes, it's fictional, but its tone is meant to be real. As such, there is no need for the usual film conventions such as character development or a clear-cut plot outline. Since when does ""raw documentary footage"" ever have any of these things?<br/><br/>I saw this film in the theatres, and while it was hard trying to suspend my disbelief at the outset, I soon found myself very much hanging on everything that was happening. I thought the filmmakers and actors did an excellent job, and it's unfortunate that the sequel that followed basically threw all of that away."

I'm not big on horror movies but as I was watching the movie, I thought the style of camera work that BWP was in was a great idea. However, with the sudden shake of the camera, it got nauseating. Overall, it's not a bad movie, but it's not that good either. The only scary thing about The Blair Witch Project, is when the movie ends (or the last two seconds of movie) because you as the audience knows what's going to happen."
"GrandpaGatewood","Null","0","1","9 July 2001"," Worth a watch but lacks some substance 7/10
","Rented this movie because I had a two-for-one coupon at BB and thought what the heck, now I can evaluate it for myself.  The fact that most of the film is spent in the woods with same leaveless trees scenery is a minus to it. However, the concentration of impending doom as you know something is going to happen ( much due to the common knowledge hyping)  to the college kids makes the woods scenes repetitiveness tolerable.  Probably the ending was worth all the dull woods mayhem. I watch movies for feelings they create in me and ideas I get from them. There was some kind of eerie completeness to the film, especially since the trio were alluded of their fate by townsfolk. What can someone expect for something that was made on a shoestring? I would like to see more newcomers produce films more in this genre, not necessarily of horror, but build up some suspense and then have something beyond their control seal their fate. In all, ignore hype and bashing of the film. You make of it what you like. I would advise though to not become a Trekkie for it. I do not know anything about the actors and other sundries about the film and care little too since I got the effect from it I wanted. Maybe some years from now it will pop up on TV and young kids will wonder what the movie was about as if they thought it was some obscure cheapie thriller. I thought that way about Night of The Living Dead when my brother made me watch on TV when I was seven years old back in the 70's. Little did I know it was a nascent cult classic. For time spent watching it and effect it gave me, I rate it a 7 out 10."

","I saw this film a year after it was released. I knew the film was fiction. I didn't buy into the hype. I didn't see the preview short films on cable that were used as a precursor and marketing tool to promote interest and background for this film. I saw clips of this film, as well as an interview with Heather Donahue, and wasn't too impressed by what I saw and heard. However, the film was in the video store for a low price, and the time was right to see the film, as Halloween was approaching. I brought the film home late one evening to my spacious apartment, popped the film into my VCR, turned off the lights, and proceeded to watch the film alone.<br/><br/>The results were a unique and brilliant film. No script, no incidental music, acting is totally improvised based on a vague plot the actors were given, film is shot entirely from the visual perspective of the three students involved in the story, etc. Viewing this film scared me like no other viewing of a film ever has. However, the film ITSELF is not scary. YOU SCARE YOU, provided you have imagination. The film throws you into a situation where your imagination is provoked into running wild; and providing certain memories of your youth are triggered (this is very important to the experience of this film), i.e. getting lost in deep woods, camping in deep woods at night and hearing eerie noises, thoughts and images about witches, you will scare yourself in a way you never thought possible. It was weeks before I could set foot in the woods again without being ""creeped out"". After viewing this film once, maybe twice, the scare factor is finished. The film doesn't hold up well as entertainment after the first or second viewing. Nevertheless, the intial scare is well worth it.<br/><br/>Two main reasons why people didn't like this film are: 1. They have NO imagination. 2. They believed and bought into the film's hype that this footage was real, sat cynically in the cinema surrounded by other people and distractions, etc. critiquing the film and taking out a white glove in their mind every time something questionable happened in the film in the hope of debunking this film as a hoax. Not a very open-minded way to watch a film.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film and you are a fan of old-fashioned horror, as opposed to big budget special effects and blatant gore films with annoying and cliched soundtrack scores, then I highly recommend buying it and watching it at home at night alone and with all the lights off. If you really want to scare yourself, listen to the film's audio on headphones whilst watching the film."

","(Warning spoiler zone ahead)<br/><br/>Before you even enter the Blair Witch Project attempted (and succeeded) in drawing in audiences about a ""legendary"" witch who was banished from her town because she was a witch.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with what the movies premise is supposed to be a documentary.  Showing the 3 student film makers walk around Burketsville, Maryland interviewing subjects about this witch who most people in the town seem to be even afraid to discover for themselves. This was designed to make you believe that the Blair Witch was a real person and supposedly her ghost is still in the woods doing evil things.<br/><br/>Apparently showing their best dialogue is about a hundred curse words used over and over when they aren't interviewing people.  Now I am very desensitized to cursing myself (and violence too) and do it on long occasions, but when it incorporates into most of the script for basically no reason at all (like when they are trying to rest in a motel) I get a little annoyed too.<br/><br/>BWP continues into the woods when they start to look for the legend themselves.  While this happens they start to walk around in circles, I hear many people saying this was due to some type of magical interference from the witch.  But they probably don't know what it's like to walk around in the woods without a map (as we see Heather lose it).<br/><br/>And then there are the obligatory ""scary"" parts of the film meant to build the movie watcher up during the walk in the woods, where the 3 students hear things like the rustling of branches and the sudden appearance of rocks in a supposed ritual formation around the site.  If this wasn't a horror movie, and something about real life you would most likely be the person thinking there are animals in the woods (wow, really?!) and that you wouldn't really notice some rocks unless you tripped over one.<br/><br/>Now the end is supposed to be the best part, but possibly for you and me it may be a little different.  For you it gets scary when one of the filmmakers disappears and they reach the house.  Well they walk slowly through the house building tension in the moviegoer and in the basement showing their friend dead, hanging from a noose.  Then suddenly with the only jump scare in the film where a hit from behind knocks down heather and expectantly though not shown, she dies.  For most of you this was the part that most likely made you scared and come back for a second time.  For me it made me happy that they finally killed those three and that they ended the film.<br/><br/>
I only watch BWP now with a showing on a cable movie station if there is nothing else that I think is better to watch.  Several things bother me though with this film which makes me dislike it most of all.  First off is the ""witch"" issue, apparently telling the audience the usual stereotype that witches are evil and kill people for no reason.  If you look at certain books (not Christian ones), web sites, and talk to people who know about it (including me) witchcraft is a real religion and the people who practice it are most often peaceful (as in every religion can't speak for all the followers).  Second problem is the fact that there wasn't really anything scary in this movie for me. I mean getting tension from heather running from some unknown adversary or mike or josh commenting about rocks around their camping area that were not previously there really isn't scary for me.  I could see how people could be anticipating what happens, but after watching it for myself I just couldn't see or feel what was so scary about this film.<br/><br/>I give this film a 5 out of 10 stars, it would have gotten much more if it had actually been something worth watching for me and others like me and if it wasn't so stereotypical about witches.  But it would have gotten less if it hadn't attracted so many people and got that much money from idiots (including me!) who would rather see the full movie in theathers (for us who aren't rich and don't have HDTV monitors and 5.1 dolby digital speakers in their house yet).  Just make sure you watch this with a open mind, otherwise you will think it was extremely great or extremely horrible (though the latter ones aren't that far from the truth!)."

","Not since Last House on the Left's (1972) 'Keep repeating, it's only a movie, it's only a movie' or the days of William Castle's The Tingler (1959) has a marketing campaign been so successful, and for that reason alone you should like this movie. The film opened with stark, white type on a black background: ...In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... Despite dramatically mixed audience reaction, The Blair Witch Project became an overnight success. The directors ""supposedly"" use the much hated, shaking hand held found footage shot by the victims before they died. Hundreds of people actually believed this hype, thanks to disinformation spread by the internet, and by the time the film got to the Sundance Film Festival, it was being promoted with missing person flyers picturing the actors. ...it's not like no-one ever thought of the idea before. Cannibal Holocaust (1979), Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1989) and Man Bites Dog (1993) all have used the fake documentary footage. Some even say the directors completely stole their movie idea from an earlier low-budget film entitled The Last Broadcast (1997). However, none of those films made the kind of cash that this one did. Blair Witch has pulled in some $140 million on an initial investment of approximately $35,00 - Night of the Living Dead (1968) cost three times that. Love it or hate it, the film has made an impact."

","Let's get it straight. If you are used to CGI monsters, special effects, and slick editing this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>The BWP relies on your imagination supplying the horror. You will never see the Blair Witch, and you certainly won't get very far by carping about the films inadequacies. However if you are prepared to take it at face value you are in for a very good time indeed. Heather D running through the forest shouting ""What the f*ck is that!?"" is the best you get - you have to supply the rest.<br/><br/>Other warnings - you can only watch this once. If you watch it again, you know what's coming, and the surprise is gone. It just becomes a badly edited, annoying shaky monolouge. So, find a few good buddies (or love interest) get some popcorn, a dark room and watch it at night with the phone, and doorbell unplugged.

I thought it was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood cr*p that's released.  At the time, the film really did scare me (a little!).  I felt my pulse rising in parts of the film, and I generally felt anxious - something that rarely happens to me from watching a film of any sort.<br/><br/>I missed out on most of the plot links the first time, and it wasn't until later that I realised the significance of some features of the plot, for example, Mike facing the corner at the end of the film, or the three piles of rocks outside the tent.<br/><br/>As I said, this film was a refreshing change to the normal Hollywood horror film you get these days.  You don't get to see what's actually frightening the trio - there are no ludicrous CGI monsters, no over-to-top gore effects. It's an original piece of work, that worked out very well for the writers/directors.<br/><br/>Although many films and series have tried to emulate this film since its release, I don't think it would ever work again.  This line is closed.<br/><br/>I watched the film again a couple of nights ago.  This time it didn't scare me at all.  I suppose it was because I knew what was going to happen.<br/><br/>So, to summarise.  The Blair Witch Project is a refreshing break from the norm.  It's original and it's genuinely spooky.

","I just saw this movie on one of the TV movie channels, so I've been exposed to most of the hype, the initial attempt to portray the film as factual, and the revelation that it is fiction. I knew what to expect as far as the amateur home video quality of the movie, and the language, and I thought it was pretty good. Certainly there were imperfections, and at some points I couldn't help adding my own mst3k type comments, but considering the lack of money spent, I was very impressed by the amount of creep for the buck. There was a lot of bad language, but in character for 20ish college students, particularly when trying to be macho (even Heather)in the face of an increasingly frightening situation. If you are willing to be scared for entertainment, see Blair Witch Project. If you have to have elaborate special effects, or CG, to be entertained, don't."

","It's hilarious to see how many people are still complaining about this movie! The funniest are those that say things like, ""If you REALLY want to be scared go see 'The Sixth Sense'"" (only if you're scared by plodding, predictable storylines) or, ""I could do that in my own backyard with a video camera."" Naturally, these comments are coming from those film aficionados who are eagerly anticipating the latest DMX/Steven Segal schlock-fest.<br/><br/>
The truth is that The Blair Witch project was a very experimental film that was picked up by the mainstream and flung into every frathouse theater in America. Naturally, the lemmings that make up the bulk of the American movie-going audience will go see ANYTHING that the media tells them to (which, incidentally, explains Hannibal) regardless of whether-or-not they even like - let alone understand - that particular genre. It would be like me going to see a movie like Il Postino and saying it sucks because no one speaks english in it.<br/><br/>With more and better technology at their disposal, film makers are becoming less and less able to actually craft a film. Everything is completely at their disposal - and if it isn't then they can just ""CG"" it into existence. Imagine how stupid Jaws would have been if Spielberg could have had ILM animate a bunch of gruesome, underwater feeding scenes. It would have become Deep Blue Sea. What if Ridley Scott had a computer animated alien running around in Alien. It would have become as stupid as Alien 3 and 4. The point is that horror works best when given very little information to process. The anticipation of the gunshot is far more frightening than the gunshot itself. (Hitchcock?)<br/><br/>We as an audience have terribly short attention spans when it comes to being entertained. Long stretches of dialogue bore us, everything needs to happen immediately and all the time or we tune out. What's happened now is that we've lost any idea of what reality looks or feels like. When someone says that the fear in Haley Joel Osment's character was more believable than the fear in Heather Donahue's character then I know we have become completely disconnected.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that The Blair Witch Project was the greatest movie ever made - it certainly had its flaws - but it was most definitely a remarkable film. Horror is always subjective so saying it just wasn't scary is a pointless argument to make concerning it's validity. Perhaps it's greatest flaw was that it was so widely released. Kinda like giving Latour '75 to winos and expect them to comment on bouquet and finish. Hopefully, someone will pick up where TBWP left off and we'll all be rewarded with something resembling substance rather than the Hollywood style that we've been spoonfed for so long now."

","A friend of mine saw this movie the day before the news of it being a fake was announced by the press. He told me that it disturbed him so badly that he couldn't get it off his mind and had nightmares about it that night. When I finally went to see it I went knowing full well that the actors hadn't really disappeared but instead had started making the talk show circuits. There were four other people in the theater besides me. Everyone hated the movie... except for me. If you've already seen this movie and hated it, then there probably isn't anything you can read here that will change your mind. But this was certainly no ordinary movie. This isn't a movie you can walk into and think ""All right, scare me! I dare you! I've seen some of the most disgusting special effects and make up that Hollywood has to offer!"" The people who challenged the movie in that way missed it completely. I figured there had to be a reason why my friend was SO deeply disturbed by it while every one was now panning it. It was because, at the time, he believed it was REAL! This movie requires total belief that the things that happened REALLY happened. That was why the studio lied to the public telling them that these three kids died. It forced the public... even for the brief time it was able to keep the story up, to believe it really happened. Thus, getting the full, intended effect of the movie. If you saw it and hated it... see it again, this time placing yourself in the woods right next to Mike, Josh, and Heather. It's maddening, it's sickening, it's terrifying. It's like a slow, torturous, inevitable slide, fingernails furrowing the ground uselessly, towards a high, deadly cliff. Also it may help to consider this. (I don't believe this is a spoiler, but I'll warn against it just to be safe) The ending and the last shot really does make sense... if you stop and think about it carefully. (repeated viewings may be required for this) While the ""lost"" part of the movie was like the slide towards the cliff I mentioned earlier... the final shot, if you ""get"" it, will make your blood run cold!

It was over all too soon and there was only maybe one scene that made you twitch a little and I mean twitch, not a jump but a twitch.<br/><br/>Overall I didn't enjoy the film all that much, even with the DVD version and all the added features, I felt robbed of a good watch. All I asked from the film was a decent storyline and at least tell us more about the ""Blair Witch"" however all we discovered in the course of the film was that the teenages were great at getting lost, hardly anything was known about the ""Blair Witch"", we didn't even get to know the characters. The angles of the camera were well done and even though it did make me a little queesy I must say that it was perfect for the film but even the great camera angle isn't enough to save this film.

He knows when to use it for maximum effect, and when not to use it. The fact that only twenty minutes into the film these children were running around screaming ""What the F's going on"" rather brought the film to a climax too soon, after which it was embarrassingly boring.<br/><br/>The concept was good, but the material as presented would have been better summed up in 30 minutes and not left to linger for over an hour. It is reminiscent of a comedian who has to milk the last laugh from a flimsy sketch, only to desist at the 20th groan.<br/><br/>More effective in my mind was the spoof documentary, ""The Curse of the Blair Witch"", which showed only enough of those embarrassing, (and probably embarrassed children), to effect a briliant concocted mythology, which would, on its own have been able to stand with all great April Fool Spoofs, such as ""The Spagetti Harvest"", ""Dinasaurs in London"", and ""The Brain Drain"".

While other shoestring budgeted film-makers try to make their productions look as slick as possible, the makers of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT purposely went for an unpolished rough look.  That means this a gimmick film (Like THE THIEF- 1952, a spy thriller with no dialog or 1973's WICKED-WICKED where the whole film was split screen.)  The star of the film was the medium. The documenting of three  student filmmakers lost in the woods, and possibly at the mercy of an unseen witch gets very tiresome.  If human star- Heather Donahue meant to play an irratating character, she did a fantastic job.  The logic of the film leaves little to be desired.  If you are lost in the woods, follow a river (they lead to bigger water bodies and civilization)  or follow the sun. I did love the last section, where Heather makes her on screen apology.  (That's the shot where we see only her nostril and nostril hairs on multiplex screens.)  The film turns from being a documentary of a witch hunt to a last will and goodbye left on video.  I actually got a bit chocked up.  The finale in the spooky house left haunting images (The many handprints on the wall, Mike in the corner, waiting to be executed) but lacked logic (Would you lug about a video camera while running for your life?)       The summer of 1999 gave us two successful horror films that pulled the genre out of the Freddie/Jason/bikini gal in peril rut (The other being THE SIXTH SENSE)       Final summary:  Poorly planned film with genius marketing and a few good scenes."

As far as SUNDANCE type indie movies go this film is sheer genius in the amount of intellect it took to concoct this story and execute it. I am in awe, it was a brainchild of pure creativity that sparked this film and it's success. The question is ....how do you improve on low budget perfection? Many didn't like the herky, jerky camera moves, however, the film has a classic horror feel. The gross outs are minimal and the anxiety factor is at an all time high.

So it doesn't actually matter whether or not you know the story is real - it works because you can very easily imagine it could be.<br/><br/>I liked the camerawork, the grainy film, the clever tricks like switching from b/w to colour & back, pointing the camera at the ground while you hear weird noises.  But while the actors were good in their parts, what makes you not care about the film as you otherwise would is the unlikeability of the main characters.  It's a fine idea of the breakdown of relationships under pressure, and it's fair enough to show the actors shouting and arguing at each other as well as their situation.  But we got too much of this, actually they were pretty much fighting with each other the entire time. This made them unlikeable ultimately - we should have seen some warmer aspects of their characters.<br/><br/>And hey, I don't mind a bit of bad language when characters are under real pressure, but it should be used sparingly or else they're just unpleasant, brutish, and you can't care about them as you want to.  These guys (all three including the girl) were shown to be swearing the whole movie, even before any scary or pressure situations - they could hardly utter a single sentence without it!  Realistic?  You don't get this level of bad language even in settings where you would more likely expect it (eg the Godfather, Reservoir Dogs).  That made them too unsympathetic, and for a real scare you SHOULD care about at least some of the characters.<br/><br/>Overall - good horror movie, but could have been quite a bit better.  I'd put it definitely outside my personal top 100 movies, maybe around number 200 or so."

","SPOILER WARNING! CAUTION... DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS! Very much so.  Aim away from face. ********<br/><br/>I rented this and, halfway through, DID have to turn on the light and make sure the doors were locked.  I imagine it was very creepy and scary in the theater, but is less so when you view it at home.  I have a real problem with motion sickness, and only had to glance away once from the rickety camera handling.  I did find it a very interesting film, frightening in its realism and well worth seeing. I think anyone and everyone will question the methods...Bringing just ONE compass and ONE map, no survival gear, no means of defense, no means of signaling for help or contacting anyone, and no competent notice of direction on the way into the woods.     ***What affected me the most was the depressing behavior of the two male lead characters as the thing wore on.  They go from typical, dumb teenagers to violent primates who can't think straight.  You get to watch them get lost, and ""resolve"" it by screaming eff words at eachother (very productive) and actually attacking eachother physically because they are so incapable of dealing with crisis.  I felt so sorry for Heather, who is stuck with these two Simian idiots through most of the film and has to put up with their complete lack of humanity by any definition.  She's the only one with sense, and there's no question that this ""Project"" was about the challenge of working with ""assigned"" partners rather than people Heather might have selected herself....Watch them blame each other and spend their vocal cords on pointless, endless profanity, then turn on Heather in violent assault.  Their immaturity and barbarism cost the group its unity, the one thing that could have saved them all. After that it's just Divide and Conquer, the unknown forces taking advantage of the group's fear, chaos and instability, and picking them off one by one. It's no surprise that the dumbest, most violent one (Josh) gets his due first.  He gives clear signs of separating himself from the other two, both mentally and physically, long before his abduction occurs. He's followed by the next idiotic (Mike), who is stupid enough to run ahead and lose contact with Heather, despite her pleading screams that they stay together.  Then she gets hers, and the end comes quickly.  The whole thing runs like predator/prey drama, with 'The Blair Witch' profiting off of the herd's confusion and separation. ***It's half 'Lord of the Flies' and half Apocalypse, with The Monster/Horror being anger, ignorance, impatience and lack of self-discipline on the parts of Josh and Mike.  They are reminiscent of preschoolers, their only concerns being ""Your Fault!""  ""No, YOUR fault!"" and blindly allowing this to supersede any attempt at cooperative problem solving.  Heather doesn't have a chance, saddled with these two lice-picking cavedwellers.*** She may have gotten everyone lost to begin with, but Josh and Mike doomed everyone irreparably. I don't know if it's a horror film or an exercise in gender comparison and typical, stereotypical male behavior, but ""The Blair Witch Project"" is certainly a creative and disappointing look at American youth gone wrong.  Interwoven with this is a macabre fable about The ""Blair Witch"" herself, who does a number on these three would-be documentary filmmakers. It has moments of humor, fright and strangeness (I am still not 100% clear on the ending), and is worth seeing for its shockingly real presentation of a one-of-a-kind story.  Even if they won't like it, I think everybody should see it.<br/><br/>And the take-home message...? If there were any ambiguity left on the subject, this film definitely proves that the most dangerous demons are the ones we take into the woods with us."

For one, most of the actual film used by the creators seems to have been wasted on shots of the ground and the trees.  I ended up getting dizzy with the way the stupid girl was waving the camera around. The most annoying thing about 'The Blair Witch Project' was that it wasn't particularly scary.  In fact, it wasn't remotely scary in any way.  Nothing made me feel uneasy and the audience in the cinema with me began to tut and look at their watches half-way into the film. Also - not many people know this - a similar, but far superior film called 'The Last Broadcast' was made a year earlier than the BWP.  I get the feeling that the BWP is a cheap and nasty version of this classic. Don't bother with this purile pile of pants; go out and rent 'Casper' because it is much more scary and far more interesting. A big YAWN."

","To me, the Blair Witch Project was something the horror genre may have needed: SOMETHING DIFFERENT!  I will say that BWP was not as scary as I thought it would be.  However, I still enjoyed it because it was something I hadn't seen before.  It was done as a documentary, therefore somewhat adding more authenticity to the film.  And although people thought this was cheesy, I believe that going into the movie thinking it was real made it extra creepy.  Fact is, there are people into witchcraft, and who's to say that something similar (notice I say ""similar"") won't happen?  That's also what I think makes the movie so good.  Sure, the filming isn't the best.  The actors are unknown.  But that just makes them ordinary people.  This movie is most likely bashed because of its lack of special effects, blood, and gore.  (It made up for it in the language, however.)  But that makes the movie more authentic and, in my opinion, scarier in a sense.  It leaves you wondering what's going on.  It leaves you thinking of what COULD be happening.  It lets your imagination run wild.  That's what I liked about this film.  I think that once people get past the fact that BWP is NOT a bloodied up, visual effects slasher flick, they would enjoy this more...but that's just me."

","The Blair Witch project is the 3rd film i'll be reviewing for my october/halloween special. This movie took the horror genre to a whole new level. I remember when this first came out the internet turned a small movie into a world wide sensation. A lot of people thought these events actually took place and who could blame them. They made news specials about the missing teens and even T.V. specials that made us believe that sometihng actually happened to these kids, Of course it turned out to be a brillant stunt by the filmmakers to make the movie seem more real. The film was shot entirely with a hand held camera and the acting was almost 100% improvised. When i first saw this movie i was impressed by its creativity but the final product kinda disappointed me.<br/><br/>As you know the plot of the movie is about 3 people who venture into the woods to do a documentary on the blair witch and strange events occur and they a re never heard from again. one year later their footage is found and we get to see what led up to their mysterious disappearance. Pretty good plot that works really well. so far so good.<br/><br/>The atmosphere really works. to me the woods is one of the scariest places to be and it really works for this film. Also being shot entirely on a hand held camera we get to experience first hand what the characters or doing or feeling. Blackouts and shaky camera movements add to the already great suspenseful tension.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Frist we get 3 funny and carefree young people who are very full of life but as the film progresses we see how fear is tearing them apart and we get to witness this first hand. Since the actors were newcomers at the time i was very impressed with their acting talent.<br/><br/>Another good thing was the last 15 or 20 minutes which are the films highlight and its most scariest moments. i was really hooked by this point at what was happening.<br/><br/>That was the good. Here is the bad.<br/><br/>The film is too short. at 87 minutes it isn't nearly long enough. I felt there should've been so much more included. it's such a quick finish that i couldn't really take it all in.<br/><br/>now, even though the film is pretty short it also tends to be pretty slow. like i said the last 15 or 20 minutes are its best but before this it seems like it takes forever to get started and sometimes it tends to drag and be a little boring<br/><br/>I liked the acting but listening to 3 people yell and curse through almost the entire movie got a little annoying and at some moments that seemed to be the films only conflict. i liked how they showed that fear was consuming them but i wish they would've concentrated more on the legend.<br/><br/>Now this is kinda my own personal gripe about the film. i lied the last 15 minutes but the actual ending itself was such a letdown. for that 20 minutes it created such a good intense build-up and all of a sudden it's over and you go ""that's it"". i know they were trying to be creative and make us wonder what happened to them without actually telling us but it just ends up being a letdown.<br/><br/>another thing that hurt this film but also helped it was the hype that surrounded it. the hype made this film gross 140 million dollars but since there was such a demand that this film be the scariest thing we've ever seen and to some it simply wasn't and i think over-hyping a film can really hurt it sometimes and this is the case with this film.<br/><br/>All and all it's creativity saves it from being a total disappointed and i do give it credit making a uge impact on the horror genre but i just wish it could've been better. 7/10"

","I have a simple criteria for judging a scary movie: It has to keep me awake at night. If it does, it's scary.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project did this brilliantly. I kept waking up in the middle of the night and glancing into the corners of my room, expecting to see Josh standing there, facing the corner.<br/><br/>The first I heard of The Blair Witch Project was when I saw a TV interview with Heather Donahue, where she was talking about how this movie was made, where the actors were out in the woods, with minimal script, and the film's producers were doing creepy things at night to scare them. The concept really intrigued me, so I decided to go see it, even though I almost never go to see horror movies - slasher films bore me.<br/><br/>So when I went to see the movie, months after it had been released, I knew it wasn't real, and the hype surrounding the film didn't affect my expectations.<br/><br/>I also went to see the movie alone, in a theater that was almost empty. This movie was meant to be seen alone. I had heard that the ""earthquake video"" filmmaking technique was upsetting, but I honestly never really noticed it.<br/><br/>What made this film so brilliant was the fact that you never saw what it was that was hunting them. We never knew what it was all about, and so, like any good ghost story, your mind and imagination is left to fill in the blanks - and my imagination is FAR more terrifying to me than anything a filmmaker could spoon-feed me.<br/><br/>I think therein lies the crux of why some people didn't like Blair Witch - they wanted the filmmakers to tell them everything, show them everything, spoon-feed them the horror. If that's what they wanted, then they were bound to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this film is that it lets the viewers scare themselves, with all sorts of personal demons and ""what if"" thoughts.<br/><br/>Because it's what's inside your own skull that is truly terrifying. Not what is put on to the screen.<br/><br/>I give The Blair Witch Project a 10 out of 10 - it goes down on my list as one of the most terrifying movies of all time."

","The movie 'Blair Witch Project' is a fantastic display of a box-office smash not needing to be a high budget action film or a soppy drama story. This film is a fantastic thrill ride for lovers of horror like myself.<br/><br/>Although I have heard people argue that the acting was sloppy, the storyline was brief and choppy at best and the camera work was complete crap; but I say thats what makes the film so creepy and entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting was obviously pretty bad but HELLO!, they weren't actually acting. It was intended to be a real life account of their search through the woods for the Witch, so when they found themselves lost and obviously not alone they started to panic; as anyone would in that situation. I myself thought it strange that they would continue to film even though things started to go wrong but the pieces of footage after the second or third night were done with Heather's camcorder on which she recorded a personal diary of the project, plus being committed to her work she probably wanted to capture every moment on film no matter how scared she was.<br/><br/>Speaking of the camera work, i believe that it was what really made the film so scary with the scenes at night where the camera was pointing toward the ground so you couldn't actually see anything but you still could hear the sounds from the woods and its then that you get the same feeling that they have, you cant see what is going on you can only hear it, which is much more frightening.<br/><br/>When I heard of the upcoming Blair Witch 2, I was disappointed that the makers had chosen to film it in the standard 3rd person perspective as all films are. Although they can't have another group of kids in the woods with their own camera again as it would simply be a redo of the original, I would have preferred if they leave it be and let the legacy that was created with the first live on instead of trying to commercialise it into a big budget film.<br/><br/>As you can tell i speak highly of this film and believe that it was what the horror genre needed, a truly creepy film that can shock you every time it is watched."

","This movie, while really an interesting curio,is a nice piece of hokum with some great moments. Most of the action is shown on video tape as we follow  3 young film makers in search of the mystery that is the Blair Witch. Obviously low budget,the whole enterprise is put together convincingly-well. Dialogue comes over as realistic and there is a tense build-up of atmosphere as spooky occurences happen.One problem with the credibility of the story is that it is not really believable that they would continue to film everything when things go so drastically wrong. However, there is much to entertain here and films like The Blair Witch Project show that just because something is low budget it is not necessarily poor quality. The DVD version is well worth exploring with a great scene by scene commentary from the producers and directors and a fantastic pseudo-documentary called The Blair Witch Legacy which expands the story and superbly complements the original movie."

","Sorry to quote Jesse, but I couldn't resist. This movie has garnered much divided opinion; both camps are right. It sucks AND it's great. First of all, immediately dismiss every opinion that whines 'where's the blood?'. Simpletons who need monsters and gore to officially enjoy a horror movie should park their cars on road shoulders and read back issues of FANGORIA while waiting for the next highway fatality to rubberneck. This is essentially a ghost story, and ghost stories frighten with mood and suggestion, not with slashed carotid arteries. But most of the naysayers have a point: after the overkill of the media hype, you DO walk away deeply disappointed after the first viewing. The narrative structure, such as it is, is clumsy and tedious. But part of that disappointment is due to the fact that horror movies are marketed to yahoos, and otherwise-rational viewers have become all too willing to think and act like yahoos when watching a horror movie in a theater. And who can blame 'em? This is what you get after 20 years of horror 'comedies' that substitute CGI, 'dream' sequences, brand-name psychos, and idiot movie critics who analogize the horror genre down to the level of a 'rollercoaster ride'. To release a serious, straightfaced, artistic horror movie nowadays is to ask audiences to think unsettling thoughts and FEEL something genuine: far easier to let the latex do the talking over a heavy-metal soundtrack and hope you can con enough kids into believing a 'director's cut' DVD of ELM STREET 12 is a statement for the ages worth owning. Now, while BLAIR WITCH is far from perfect, it does have one 'monster' that no fx wizard could ever approach...those damned woods. Anyone who's ever gotten lost on a camping trip, or even driven through the woods at night, knows exactly what I'm saying here. There's something deeply, frighteningly eldritch and pre-human about wooded areas. Early in the movie, the three students drive past a rotted, primitive shack nestled in the woods. The shack plays no part whatsoever in the later scenes, it's just a two-second visual throwaway, but it called up disturbing memories. I've driven past a dozen shacks like that, and I always wonder: who lives there, COULD live there? I never think 'those people must be desperately poor'; instead, I think 'this is what communing with nature really means'. Nature isn't Bambi and Grizzly Adams, it's harsh, unforgiving, cruel, remorseless; the territory of elder Gods who predate our warm and fuzzy civilized notions of deities and divinities. To live out in those woods and survive, you must bring tribute and make offerings to elemental forces so terrible that our ancestors finally fled, formed socities, created cities....ain't NOTHING scarier than the wild. As the three kids in this movie venture deeper into the woods, I felt a deep intuitive foreboding forming in the most primitive jelly of my brain. They're doomed because they've learned to be afraid of people but they've forgotten to be afraid of Nature, and deeper they go into a place where the very terrain- the rocks, the trees, the dirt beneath their feet - is the predator stalking them. All the faux-hostility they've learned from rap music and schoolyard brawls can't help them now. If you saw this flick and left the theater underwhelmed, see it again, alone, late at night. You might think twice about preserving any rainforest anywhere. The 'movie' part of BLAIR WITCH may be weak tea, but those haunted woods are scarier than any weightlifter in a hockey mask."

","I just caught this particular movie on cable last night. It was just about 60 minutes into the movie. My wife who was with me had paid to see this movie at the theater(she regretted that.) I had to agree with her assessment of the movie at the time. However after viewing these user comments on this site, I have to agree that this is a very scary movie because it lets your imagination go wild!!!!!  Who hasn't been out in the woods alone at night hearing strange and terrifying sounds that make you want to barrel back home. Why do you think Halloween is so fun;because of the dark and strange sights that inhabit the streets and towns on that night. Not to mention the weird sounds. There are still alot of people still afraid of the dark(even if they would never admit it to you) much less the woods. I will now admit that I can't go out to the woods by myself, it creeps me out. It is a primal fear of the unknown. It is something learned from movies, Hollywood, bad childhood experiences. Whenever I try to do this thing my heart starts to pump furiously as if it is preparing my body to flee something that my mind cannot detect!! Maybe this is an anxiety attack. I don't know. My wife experiences the same thing if I try to get her to ride a roller coaster!So we have something in common. I remember one time when I was a kid and walking along the road to the store late one night when all you heard at that hour was a dog barking. All of a sudden, from out of the night emerged a loud whirring sound, that caused my adrenaline to pump like mad, and resulted in my legs starting to move my feet so fast, that I actually peeled out in the gravel and fell down. It was just then I looked up  in the direction of the sound not finding  a flying saucer but somebody moving their rotatable antenna. So you see our imagination can scare us or help us as in inventing things that will help others. It is all in how you look at it. Just this past summer I and my wife took a trip to Canada, and one of the things that I had always wanted to do was take a seaplane ride. We were given directions to this destination.It was 50 miles away! My wife told me we should get some gas first as our gas meter was just under half a tank, but I figured that we had enough. I thought that our way of travel would be on paved roads but as it turned out, it could have been the same road those men traveled in ""A Fire From The Sky"" It was a turning, twisting dusty road that slowed us down quite abit. I was trying to get to the place before nightfall, but my wife wanted me to slow down because she was afraid we would be killed. What was driving me to push our car beyond it's limits, again that primal fear. We made it before the nighttime, thank God!!I hope that my comments help someone who has the same fear\s to recongise this. It seems the only time someone gets help with these things is when it is mentioned in Ann Landers, or some other outlet."

","I don't know about you, but after an hour of this inane movie, I was barracking for the psycho. There hasn't been a decent horror for some time now, so I walked into the cinema primed for a good scare.<br/><br/>
Nada. As the movie goes on, you keep wondering when something scary is going to happen. Nothing does. Apparently there's a nut somewhere out in the woods. Could be a witch, maybe it's just a garden variety serial killer. Whoever they are they must get lonely waiting for people to come by the forest so they can employ their unbelievably subtle brand of terror.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the biggest flaw is that the movie doesn't make you actually care about the characters. Their constant bickering may have been intended to be some sort of descent into chaos, but in fact it was just annoying. <br/><br/>
Enough said? It's a dud. Save your dough."

Blair Witch<br/><br/>works in the creep factor because no one, not even the<br/><br/>audience, is in on the joke; also this film was an experiment on psychological terror than anything else.

It is H.P.<br/><br/>Lovecraft who states, ""The oldest and strongest emotion of <br/><br/>mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear<br/><br/>is the fear of the unknown.

While I admit that the thought of being caught alone by yourselves lost in the middle of some scary forest is scary, the film could do a bit better by maybe slipping in some footage of 'scary' objects like a fleeting glimpse of a white shawl floating or something. And the jerkiness of the movie gave me (and my friends)an immense headache and nausea during the 2nd half of the show, that didn't subside until about half hour after the show ended.

This truly is a masterpiece of ""suggested"" horror where you don't see what is terrorizing these young filmmakers but you know that whatever it is must be truly frightening and extremely cruel. As a result your imagination begins to run away with you. you find yourself wondering what could be after these kids. you wait nervously as you peer through their video camera into the dark wondering what if anything will come out and attack them. All these things work for the film as does the ""documentary' aspect where you are looking through the cameras of these kids. As for the acting being amatuerish, well that is exactly what is so powerful! It reminds you that these are just ordinary people like you and I caught in a horrific situation.

The setup of the ""real"" people talking about the myth, and the three students casually (at first) trying to film a documentary were so easy to take as real. Even before things started happening, I started to have an instinctive uneasy feeling that I tried to shrug off, like the students did, but it didn't go away and the tension slowly built. And as far as sticks and stones not being scary - come now! If you were out in the woods with your friends and you saw a pile of rocks outside your tent that you know you and your buddies didn't put there, wouldn't that freak you out just a little. In the movies, maybe you need a demon posessing a little girl, or blood gushing through hallways, but in reality (like this seemed) a strategically placed rock pile out of nowhere is quite enough.

Also, it's unfair to criticize the actors in any way because it was real. There wasn't a script so all you see is talent.

","Ok, I saw BWP on Showtime a few weeks ago with low expectations.  It was actually better than I thought it would be.  However, it was far from perfect.  First and foremost, I have to bring up how unprepared the students were.  If I went into the woods I would bring flairs, two cel phones and four batteries, an emergency phone, matches, a lighter, a radio, a GPS and tons of food.  Also, everyone knows that when you plan on going into the woods (or mountains, or anything like that), you tell all your friends when you intend on coming back. That way, if you are gone for even a day extra, you have a search team looking for you.<br/><br/>SPOILER ><br/><br/>Second of all, how STUPID would anyone be to throw away the only map they had?  I couldn't believe that anyone could be that dumb.  Oh, yeah, and not to mention the continuity errors which ruined any sense of realism that I had.  For example, after Josh dissapears, there is a shot of Heather and Mike leaning on a tree, next to each other.  Suddenly, the camera cuts to a shot of them rocking back and forth.  Ok, so who turned off the camera? Josh?  No, Josh was gone.  It didnt' turn itself off.  There are many instances of this, but I won't mention them all.<br/><br/>One thing that many people complained about was the swearing.  People say, ""The whole movie was just three kids swearing"".  Well, I hate to break it to you, but that's how kids act.  I don'tswear any less around my friends than they did in the movie, and that added a touch of realism to my perception of the film.  And, to the film's credit, the ending was superb.  So basically, It was worth seeing, but not a classic or anything."

I think that people who didn't like it and were expecting more are too wrapped up in bad Hollywood special effects movies to appreciate a really scary movie (such people are the same people who don't appreciate the terror in the shower scene in ""Psycho.""  They look at it and say, ""'s not scary.""<br/><br/>Anyway, I think that to really appreciate this movie is to buy the 2-tape set of the movie and the ""Curse of the Blair Witch.""  Watch ""Curse"" first and then the movie and allow yourself to believe this really happened because that is what makes the movie horrifying.  I sat in the theater feeling terrified ... not because ""something was going to happen,"" but because I felt lost along with these kids.  And yeah, I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did, the last shot of the movie just stayed with me ... I can picture it now and it scared the hell out of me.  Of course, you have to pay attention to all the back story to know why it's scary.  And what it does is it leads you to question the existence of the witch and the validity of the ""legend"" the movie is created around.<br/><br/>Oh, one more comment.  Somebody wrote a review wondering why they didn't take cell phones into the woods and another person wondered how all their electronic equipment stood the test of time.<br/><br/>First, the electronic equipment, if you followed the back story, was found in an undisturbed archaeological site.  In other words ... something put it there, but what (the mystery deepens).<br/><br/>Second, on cell phones.  The movie takes place in 1994.  That's important for a reason besides the fact that they have been gone for so long.  It wasn't until after the 1996 telecommunications bill was passed that smaller cellular companies and smaller local/long-distance companies started popping up.  In other words, cell phones have been around, but have only been in such widespread use by COLLEGE STUDENTS in the last 3-5 years ... after the movie.

","This is going to be a very inchoerent text, i´m sure, because to tell you the truth i still don´t know what to make of this movie. I don´t know, and as probably i never will, i decided to write this, and decide on the spot what i think about THE BLAIR WITCH...hemm...thing.<br/><br/>First of all, i can´t understand how many people were fooled into thinking, this was real life footage. There´s a particulary scene where two of the characters are having a discussion and the third one is filming everything, then one of the characters who were fighting changes place with the guy holding the camera, and goes in front of camera continuing the discussion, while the other now keeps filming the whole thing. Now... Wouldn´t it be more natural, when a discussion broke out, that the guy holding the camera, would put it aside or droped it on the floor so he could break the fight apart ?... Why keep filming the whole thing and then trade places with one of the persons figihting ?<br/><br/>It´s clear that they wanted the figth on camera, so that would create the ""classic"" tense moment between friends when lost. Just this scene would be enough for me to get realy suspicious.<br/><br/>So, apart from this...is this a good movie ? Well...where´s the movie ?...It´s a cool scam, a very good idea, with a great marketing campain.<br/><br/>As for the movie, if the idea of random shots of trees and people walking around in the same place for about an hour is appealing to you, then go right ahead. I mean, there are ""empty"" films where aparently nothing much is going on but are very profound sideways like David Lynch´s "" A Straight Story"", and then there are films where nothing is going on at all like BLAIR WITCH, wich as far as i know doesn´t have any deep meaning or philosophy behind... I´m not totaly against this, because at least i think it´s a very original experience particulary nowadays where all the films have a very stylized look, but it´s no great movie.<br/><br/>If you want an horror movie, with a crude raw look, then go rent THE EVIL DEAD instead. Or Peter Jackson´s BAD TASTE.  Now this is how you make a very low no-budget production with imagination. And i´m not talking about special effects. The problem with BLAIR WITCH is its emptiness where nothing happens, where not even the location changes. It´s not scary. It´s just boring. If the idea was to create some suspance, well it works at the begining, but then what ? The scene in the tent is brilliant and very well acomplished.  I only wished the whole movie was as creepy as this segment. The ending is abrupt and inconclusive, but of course it had to be, so this could pass for a real misterious crime footage found somewhere. Many people complain about the ending, i don´t, i think it´s perfect for this story and fits perfectly in the idea of reality.<br/><br/>I only saw this movie at the theater, but i´m sure this one is perfect for tv, where you don´t have to ear people eating pocorns next to you, and talking about last night´s football game while nothing happened in the movie. After this kind of theater experience with BLAIR WITCH, now i give even more valour to a music soundtrack. :-)<br/><br/>By the end, i don´t know what to think of this movie. I enjoyed it, but it could have been brilliant, instead of just original. Overall it´s a missed oportunity. Even the fake Blair Witch documentary responsible to give credibility to this story is a million times better and scary than the actual movie, wich only has two good bits, the scene in the tent with the voices of little children, and the final moments. It´s a nice peculiar movie, but it sure didn´t deserved all its sucess. On the other hand, it´s good to see someone in american movies, trying to inovate. Just for this Blair Witch should be praised.

","The effect was weak, at best.  I saw it while the hype was still a buzz, during its first week of release at the arthouses and well before it shot into Multiplex City.<br/><br/>It's been compared to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which, in spite of the schlocky production, is genuinely a much scarier and more disturbing film. Where we had an overweight man wearing a grotesquely hewn leather mask, placing screaming girls on meathooks and sawing through brush after his last survivor, Horror Redefined now has us shaking in our boots from bundles of sticks and circles of stones.  I suppose that means that in the new world of what is scary, a circle of visciously screaming bumpkins trying to force the corpse of their dead patriarch to drop a hammer on a bound and defenseless girl's head is no match for casual-drug teens spewing language that would make Lenny Bruce blush.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the 'innovation' of horror and fright coming from the unseen had been developed long since-- and, as in Maupassant's stories of anguish (1887-90), expressed more eloquently.<br/><br/>The cinematography gives rise to either motion sickness or boredom, and the production is so vapid as to be beyond belief.  It is certainly a promising student film effort, but hardly one that deserved such attention.<br/><br/>In sum, the most frightening thing about The Blair Witch Project is that a considerable portion of the film cognoscenti seemed utterly convinced that it was a groundbreaking cinematic achievement."

It's a story more about how not to get lost in the woods than about any witch or ghost.  I understand the concept: don't let the audience know anything more than the characters.  Use sparse sounds and suggestions; let the audience's imagination do the rest.  But here's the problem with that: there's no payoff.  You're left TOO MUCH to your own imagination.

For two weeks afterward, they insisted that the Blair Witch was real, and that Josh, Heather, and Mike were really victims of her evil. Miraculous that their video cameras could not stay steady for a three-second stretch, yet remained impervious to three *years* of rain damage until the footage was found.<br/><br/>As for my opinion of the movie?  I, as I usually do, decided to gauge public reaction to the movie before I decided to spend $8 seeing it at a first-run movie theater or wait a few weeks to see it at the $1.50 movies.  The problem was, everyone's reaction to it was either ""I love it"" or ""I hate it.""  I liked it, although it's really hard to enjoy a movie that makes you physically nauseous.  ""Anyone who gets carsick should not see this movie on the big screen,"" would have been a good tagline for BWP.  I only went because my sister, who usually is a harping female dog, decided to suck up to me, since she can't drive.<br/><br/>All in all, BWP was an art house flick that got over-hyped.  I've heard it compared to Titanic, in that it was touted as ""the biggest movie of the century"" yet was a big disappointment.  I wouldn't go that far.  I personally liked it and bought it on video (for $4.99 at a Blockbuster used-videos sale), but I haven't attached a meaningful sentiment to it, like ""BWP is an excellent movie because it makes you look into your soul.""

"Zen Bones","Null","0","1","17 July 2000"," Use your Imagination!
","The best films call on our imaginations.  The very reason that there is such a difference of opinion of this film is because of that. Each person viewed a different film because what was experienced was ultimately not on the screen but in the minds of the viewer.  The film gave us a premise and left us to take it in our own direction, much like the radio shows of yesteryear. Today, many people do not really know how to use their imaginations. They don't read books.  They're used to seeing films where everything is shown, where emotions are reduced to cynicism, and where reality is defined in clear-cut images.<br/><br/>This film is not about the Blair Witch, or a group of foul-mouthed teens (I can't believe that somebody actually felt a need to count how many times the word ""f**k"" was used!) lost in the woods, or how to make an audience nauseous via shaky camera movements.  It's about terror, pure and simple. Horror movies are a dime a dozen.  This is not a horror movie. In is an exercise in finding a way to enable an audience to delve into the same world that their personal nightmares spring from (their own dark imaginations) through the device of cameras, lights and a fine cast. At the end, whether it is a success or not is up to the viewer, not the filmmakers.  They built the boat and set the course, but it is our task to steer it.<br/><br/>I do however give great credit to the filmmakers who crafted such a fine vehicle. And I have to give major kudos to Heather Donohue who gave the best performance of the year (along with Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry"").  It is through her voice that we hear our own terror voiced.  And most importantly see reflected in her eyes.  Tremendous performance!  Very interesting film!"

","The Blair Witch Project is an original, quirky flick that is not all that it seems.  Like most people, I had heard all the hoopla about its hype and Internet shenanigans before I saw it.  Going into the theatre on a dreary day (and in a tired, down mood, to boot), I was ready to be put to the test.<br/><br/>A few minutes after the flick ended, I looked at my friend and we both said the same thing: ""What a lame movie!""  It was true, it seemed.  This had been much ado about nothing.  Sure, it was an interesting idea, but come on.  A group of kids basically screaming and cursing (the latter much more so) about their fate in the dark woods, to the point of being annoying.  So I left the theatre somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>But then a strange thing happened.  Several days later, some of the movie's more effective shots began coming back to me (and,  much to my dismay, at night).  The three cairns piled outside the tent in the morning. The human figurines hanging silently from the trees.  The little surprise package, wrapped up in a piece of the missing Josh's shirt.   In short, the movie was starting to work some odious magic on me.  I began to feel, for one of the few times in my life, a sense of true horror and dread, or at least something close.  And I began to consider the existence of all of those unseen powers and forces we know from Stephen King and other horror stories. <br/><br/>Do they exist?  Could they exist?  Who knows--that is probably part of the game.  We will never know, until it is too late, as it was for the trio in Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>The only thing I found unbelievable about this movie was at the end, when the filmmakers are in the house, and they know full well that something awful is about to happen, yet they are still shown with their cameras to their eyes, walking around filming everything.  I'd be so scared I sure would not be worried about my camcorder at that point.<br/><br/>But that aside, The Blair Witch Project has both the capacity to bore as well as the capacity to frighten.

"Odysseus-5","Null","0","1","28 June 2000"," This film you'll either love or hate...
","and it all comes down to just what your expectations are.<br/><br/>In all horror films that work, there are really only two mechanics that grab the viewers and give them the shakes.  The first is the contemplation of some idea or concept that is truly horrifying.  This is very rarely the case in films, as most films cannot convey complex concepts and ideas that well. Some films that deal with the possibilities of disasters and ""aftermath"" films try.  Films like _The Andromeda Strain_ come to mind - although obstensibly a sci-fi film, the premise of this film when I saw it first years ago really gave me the chills.<br/><br/>Then, more often, there are films that give you a vicarious scare by letting you imagine yourself in a dangerous or terrifying situation.  This is a lot easier to do, of course, and so most horror films fall into this ""suspense-thriller"" pattern.  I like the former better, but this - if done well - can still scare pretty good, and can still make for a great film.<br/><br/>_The Blair Witch Project_ does both.  And the ONLY reason it works at all is because it does use both elements - one by itself given this film just won't work, and if you ""don't get it"" - if either part goes over your head - you're just going to be confused by this film.  I think that is why so many people don't like it.<br/><br/>But if you can grasp onto the supernatural horror of this film, and if the ""ultra-realistic"" way it was filmed can help let you put yourself into the film (like it did for me) then this film is VERY creepy and will keep you awake listening to those little bumps in the night for a good long time. Only one thing though - do NOT see this on the big screen, because you'll be too distracted by the feeling in your stomach at the ""bad"" camerawork. Besides, the better setting is in a nice dark room... or tent... at night... lost... in the woods... :-)  Enjoy."

","The Blair Witch Project is a very interesting movie.  It is advertised as an actual event - ""In 1994, three student filmmakers disappeard in the woods of Burketsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary.  Three years later, their footage was found.""  A lot of people hated Blair Witch because they claimed that ""I could of made that movie myself!"" or that ""It wasn't even scary!""  Most people today are used to chop 'em up slasher movies.  For fans of those movies, the usual definition of a scary movie is a movie with lots of gore and lots of things jumping out of the shadows and making you jump. Movies like these fail to have a creepiness about them.  A scary movie should be subtle in most parts, mysterious, and it should get under your skin.  Blair Witch does this.  Our stars, Mike, Heather, and Josh, are pursued by something that is unidentifiable and mysterious.  Evidence of it is heard at night, when it..or them...lets itself be heard.  At one point in the film the characters are in a tent at night and hear a warped, unearthly noise.  This sound alone without knowing exactly what made it is creepier than some burly man with an axe.  Even the legend of the Blair Witch is unsettling.  While in bed at night, I read an Blair Witch ad that had a list of occurrences involving the Blair Witch.  One in where 7 men are found in the woods stretched on a big rock, disembowled and bound together by their hands and legs.  Reading that gave me the creeps.  In my opinion, The Blair Witch Project wasn't as ""Scary as Hell"" as Rolling Stone claimed it was, but it was indeed very creepy.

Nothing at all.....<br/><br/>First of all, the way, how the movie is presented makes a great amount of possible identification. It packs the movie into a box with a realistic flair, it could also be a report or a ""real"" story. You feel, this could be real. But the real nightmare is the imagination of being alone in a dark wood. The producers play with THE basic human fear, the imagination of being alone in the darkness, intercepted by something very hazardous, turning every view backwards into a horror trip. Daylight is just a divine gift and darkness is the feared terror. The time, the sky begins to turn darker and darker boosts the terror for the viewer with every night scene. The first is rather harmless, the next one brings the horror noises in the distance and the next time it increases, until the two can listen to the (real?) screams of their lost companion. Which terror is greater than the imagination of being alone in a dark wood and hearing a friend crying in pain and dispair? The best fact is: you NEVER see the evil itself. That is the point and the evil essence of the movie, you never see the evil ""thing"". You just imagine, what it could be.<br/><br/>The scene in the house, in the middle of the wood, perfectizes the horror feeling. Though terrified by the noises and the screams, the two persons rush into the scary house, go upstairs, although the evil witch could be around the next corner. But then the basement and the last scene: - END.<br/><br/>Phew, this one shocked, really. Less can be more and BWP is the best proof for this fact.

""I'm so sorry"" she blubbers.  This I believe is what the makers of this movie should be doing right now.<br/><br/>Never have I been so bored out of my skull watching a movie - it has to be the worst film of all time. In my first sentence I said that I don't remember the characters names, and there is a good reason for this.  I don't care enough about these characters.  I don't care if they live or die, I just wanted something to happen so that I hadn't wasted £20.

I sat up and paid attention, my heart starting to beat a bit harder, the movie finally begining to show promise.  Sadly, the movie finished without making good on this promise, and the feeling of utter disapointment reared it's head.<br/><br/>One good thing though was the fact that I had the DVD version which contained the vastly superior documentary ""the curse of the Blair Witch"".  This is closer to what the actual movie should have been.  As I have told many people before, the ""real footage"" should have been intercut into a larger whole.  A proper movie with the kids going out looking for the witch, then them not returning home, a police search, finding the footage followed by clips, then they either find the missing youths (dead or alive) and get a little bit closer to solving the mystery (Scooby Doo ending anybody?).

","The Blair Witch Project (1999) Reviewed January 3, 2014 after 2nd viewing (Blu-ray)<br/><br/>A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.<br/><br/>Where to start Well, I will preface my review with the following: The first time I saw this, I was scared out of my wits. Why you ask? Probably because I watched it at home in the dark late at night with no one else in the house, I was 16, and I had not discovered The X-Files yet (yes, it was out, but I did not start watching it until 3 months later). Now that I have a lot more knowledge, wisdom, and film expertise, I can see what a tragic cinematic failure it was.<br/><br/>The characters have little to offer the film. We barely even relate to them. Heather starts off as this well-to-do, innocent, but headstrong and controlling film student and winds up a whimpering baby. She knows something is out there and her bright idea is to go check it out in the middle of the night with armed with nothing more than a camera and a flashlight? Not so bright OR believable. I grew up camping with my dad (yes, in a tent in the middle of nowhere) in far more remote and scarier places than this, and I can PROMISE you, if you hear a weird noise in the night, the ONLY natural reaction you would have is to a) run to the car and lock yourself in till morning, or if you don't have an easily accessible car, b) stay in the tent, pull the covers over your head, and pray for daylight. You do NOT go venturing out to ""see"" what it is when there is no ""seeing"" to be had, documentary or not. <br/><br/>And her two supporting males? Let's put it this way: I only finally figured out who was Mike and who was Josh when Josh disappeared! They interchanged roles so much between the oversensitive asshole and the pacifist, I couldn't tell who was who, and I cared for neither. Part of the success of a film is portraying believable characters that the audience connects with, and all we're doing is screaming at the screen about how stupid they are. And yes, it's scary, but I kept being taken out of the film by Heather Donahue's OVER-acting. It was unnatural and you could feel it was forced, not gripping and intense the way it was supposed to come off.<br/><br/>Plot you ask? What plot? It is nonexistent. So for starters, they never explain why they are trusting some guy they don't even know to go into the woods and camp to make a documentary in the first places. Then they complain about getting wet from crossing a creek What? And did no one else notice that in the beginning, they were only supposed to be out there for a weekend. I counted one night actually, and they got NOTHING. What was on the documentary? Like a few interviews from crazy locals, them in a motel room, them walking, and some rocks they found in a pile? That was in the first 20 minutes of the film they started to go back! Then as what little tension builds does, Heather suddenly decides there must be something in those bound twigs that appeared mysteriously on our doorstep in the middle of the night, so she unwraps it to find I still don't quite know what Fingers? She completely loses it and is hysterical, and yet we're supposed to believe she very rationally decides not to tell Mike? I understand why someone wouldn't—to keep him from panicking so that they both don't lose it—but she's not in her right mind!! That's the point isn't it?! Not to mention Mike just throws the map in the river cause he gets mad! If you're that paranoid about getting lost and that anal about getting back on time, that is the LAST thing you do. Just unbelievable all the way around.<br/><br/>As for the director, he was obviously loony when he wrote and 'directed' this. I use the term loosely because he states he instructed them to film everything so that it appears as a documentary. The first 10 minutes are so boring you almost cut the film off. Then there's the matter of camera quality—I mean, come on--even in 1999 it was better than this. And what is with the constant switching from color to black and white? It only serves to distract the viewer and keep the focus off the story. Pick one and stick with it! <br/><br/>In all seriousness, not to offer insult to the show in the last because I love it, but an episode of ""Ghost Adventures"" is far scarier than this, and at least its NOT fiction pretending to be fact! Each episode documents evidence, history, and fact at a REAL location about a REAL supernatural event. The LEAST the screenwriters could have done was develop a film based off an ACTUAL LEGEND. The lack thereof only serves its intended purpose of creating never- ending loopholes for the directors to do whatever they want and be as minimalist as possible. Their motto: Minimum input, maximum gain. Do NOT be fooled! This film is nothing more than a cheap trick to make a quick buck. I hate to say it, but Paranormal Activity (the first one) did it so much better. *I* could do better if I had a video camera and two friends dumb enough to follow me into the woods based on rumor.

","**Warning for spoilers** **Sorry for some spellingmisstakes**<br/><br/>
This movie is scary as hell, and I'm not saying this because I'm hyped up, or because I'm going with my friends. Actually, the way I see it, everybody hated this movie. Well that is quite frightening. Has the world gone so crazy that people excpect I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER every time they walk in to a cinema?<br/><br/>Let's put it this way. You people who don't like this movie has many reasons not to, but no one of them really is fair. I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.<br/><br/>3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every day<br/><br/>REALISM SCARES HERE:<br/><br/>First of all, the acting IS NOT BAD! It is just the fact that this is a REALISTIC PORTRAIT! This is the way they'd react too, whatever they say, and it seems to piss them off royaly.<br/><br/>The PLOT is genius for a non-budget film. Also the 8mm is genius for a non-budget. Didn't you guys feel like this was something REAL? Didn't you get the feeling that this actually happened? Frankly this movie felt like a recording I found on the attic or something. Because I could RELATE TO THE MOVIE, IT WAS VERY REALISTIC! All these negative comments, nobody says anything about it not being realistic, because IT IS! And NOBODY EVER THOUGHT ""Hey, it was pretty realistic...Maybe that was the scary thing about it?"" Well, IT WAS!<br/><br/>Is it anybody who really honestly doesn't agree? It shouldn't but in that case, please mail me."

","What kind of movie-goer am I? I'll tell you. I go to the bargain matinee. Saturday Night Live better do a sketch about this movie. It's already reached cult status. <br/><br/>                                        Anyway, I'm the kind of movie-goer who decides, in that moment when getting up out of my seat at the end, after watching for the ENTIRE 82 minutes, whether or not I got my money's worth.<br/><br/>                                        I had visited the movie's official web site beforehand. I even heard word-of-mouth about the flick from people who had seen the Sci-Fi Channel's coverage on it. I knew it wasn't true. I knew that this movie created a buzz at Sundance, and in movie circles in print and online. I realize that these neophyte film makers wanted to produce a successful movie. I don't know if they actually think this work is any more than performance art, or if they think it's a milestone in cinematic expression. By any standards, one that puts the asses in the seats to the tune of over $36M in less than a week of its nationwide release, especially when it cost only $25K or $60K to make, (depending on what article is correct) qualifies it as a HUGE success. I only wish that it had been a better movie. I can't help but feel I've been taken by the gimmick. The hype is rarely ever matched by the product, is it? It wasn't supposed to be a real movie was it? Just ""documentary footage"" that was found and put together. That would cover a multitude of cinematic sins, wouldn't it? Doesn't hurt to cover your bases, does it? It could even be bad, huh?<br/><br/>                                        Ingenious as it is, the marketing of this production-on-a-shoestring delivers a first effort that left me unsatisfied. I agree that there were a few great moments that were genuinely creepy, but they were separated by far too much tedious repetition included for the sake of ""realism."" The fighting, yelling, and screaming at each other came quite quickly, it seems, for a movie that went so slowly. After only a couple days in the woods they mentally ""fell apart."" The ""improvised acting"" suffered a bit there. The things that went bump in the night promised something more that never came. The distant unknown sounds and voices were as scary as it got, and could have led to something else, but never really did, beyond the blurry images inside the house, maybe. The ending was actually a relief. It finally put an end to the crying, the yelling, the shaking camera, and the almost endless asking, ""What was that??!!!"" We never do find out, and have to figure it must've been the wicked witch of Blair. It WAS something. Right? I have to laugh at the people who say they're the only one who ""got"" the movie. Many people are reading things into this movie's ending, but if it makes you feel better...<br/><br/>                                        You can discuss whether or not the actors are hotties, thanks to the previous ""Scream"" and ""...Last Summer"" movies, and talk about the ticket sales and statistics, but why not talk about what makes some movies really good, others really great, and some a waste of time. I can't say this one was a waste. You should see what the fuss and hype is all about, but don't expect a classic. There are people risking fortunes every day who think they know what would make a good movie. These particular guys accomplished something imaginative that will certainly be imitated. They tried to scare us without using a big bank roll, special effects, gore, monster costumes, puppets, guns, explosions, or gratuitous nudity, sex and violence. That alone is a novel idea. They used sticks and stones and sounds and darkness. I consider that an extremely brave approach when you're aiming at the cynical, computer-literate, self-absorbed, seen-it-all, mostly 17-34 year old, MTV Generation movie audience member who just forked over $4.25 to $9.00 per person and said, ""Okay, now scare me."" <br/><br/>                                        Hey, if I could make a better movie I would. I'm only speaking from an actor's perspective, and as a person who likes movies. They're the ones who had the guts to turn a few good ideas into millions at the box office, not me. <br/><br/>                                        I'm the kind of movie-goer who is hopeful. Since Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick will have a bigger budget to work with on their next project, which they claim will be a wacky comedy, I hope that it will do a much better job at making me laugh than The Blair Witch Project did at scaring me. It would be nice to get my money's worth. I wonder if they need any more unknown actors...<br/><br/>                                        Wait a minute... did you hear something?

","There is only one thing required to be spooked by this movie...an imagination. I read all these people saying that this is the worst movie they've ever seen. Oh, it wasn't scary, the people were stupid, it wasn't realistic, etc. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Those people missed the point of the movie entirely. You weren't supposed to be analyzing the peoples actions. You were supposed to experiencing what was happening to them. That's why EVERY second of this movie is shown through someone's point of view. That was the whole point behind the filming technique. You weren't supposed to be watching what was happening. It was supposed to be happening to you. Have you ever been lost? Heard a strange noise in the middle of the night? Been afraid in a situation that was completely out of your control? Fear is based purely on one thing...the unknown. Humans fear the unknown more than anything else. We fear dying because we don't know what it will be like. We fear pain because until it happens, we don't know what it will feel like. We fear loss because we don't know if we will be able to cope with that loss. That was the focus of the characters fears. They don't know what they are hearing at night. Who is watching them? What do the want? Why won't they show themselves? Now people complained (spoiler here) that when the characters discover neatly stacked piles rocks surrounding their tent one morning that that wasn't scary. Of ourse rocks aren't scary. They're rocks. The point is that someone was there. Someone, or something, was right outside their tent that night. They were there long enough to build those rock piles. Whatever was watching them had gotten that close to them, and they didn't even know it. Now THAT is scary. And that is the whold point of the movie. Things that are happening aren't sxplained. your imagination is let free to run wild. You think of the creepy stories told earlier in the movie and wonder what it is that is coming for them. We are all born afraid. But there are two kinds of fear: instinctive fear, and learned fear. We are born afraid of things like the dark, sudden loud noises, abandonment. We have to be taught to be afraid of things like, strangers, sharp objects, weapons. This movie plays on those primal fears. You can't cotrol what is going on. You are completely at the mercy of whatever is stalking you. So what if things aren't explained in great detail? You are left to think about the movie and draw your own conclusions. Roger Ebert said it best, ""The noise in the dark is scarier than what makes the noise in the dark."" My, and the movies', point exactly. Truly a great film that is guaranteed to give you a world class case of the creeps long after the movie has ended Just put yourself in their shoes and let your imagination do the rest. **** out of ****."

","First of all I really, really liked this movie. But then again I have an imagination. I thought this movie was the most thought and sensory invoking movie I've ever seen. No there aren't any quatrillion dollar special effects. The fear is much more cerebral. Anyone who has spent as much time as I have outdoors, knows how every breaking stick sounds like a gun shot, and every gust of wind sounds like an animal growl.<br/><br/>If nothing else, the movie is brilliant as an experiment in human behavior. To watch how confusion, fear, hunger, exhaustion, and isolation will break a person down. during my days in the Army, I've spent weeks at a time in the jungles of Central America, and know what it's like to be lost and tired, and scarred. Try it some time.<br/><br/>OK so the constant movement of the camera was a little much, but I never really noticed it much. If you go expecting a big James Cameron THX monster to pop out for a bunch of explosions, don't see it. Because you will be disappointed. That's why I say NOT for the MTV/Nintendo generation. There is no constant barage of light and sounds and explosions and music and CGI monsters and stuff to bombard the senses. You have to IMAGINE what it's like to hear something outside your tent at 4:00 in the morning.<br/><br/>
If you want special effects go watch the next ready made block buster trillion dollar extraviganza. If you have an imagination, and would like to be genuinely scarred, see the Blair Witch Project. This is movie making stripped down to the basics. 8 out of 10 *'s"

","When I was in high school I had a classmate whose boyfriend made amateur horror movies. I never got to see them, but those who did said they were awful. When I first heard of The Blair Witch Project and the way it had been made, I expected something like that; so, since I did not expect much, the fact that I liked it probably doesn't mean much anyway. I didn't think it was brilliant, but I did like it. I found it well done: the pseudo-documentary feel does not slip up in any glaring way, and I can see why some of the people who saw it first could not believe it was fake. The off-kilter camera and the unpolished look only adds to its plausibility. Also, the dialogue probably will not enter any intelligence contest, but you have to agree that if people in that situation started reciting sage lines, that would not be very believable. Anyway it is no worse than some lines I've heard in movies supposed to be ""high art."" And, although I cannot say I felt very scared (except by the ending, maybe), the movie does have an eerie atmosphere that is very unsettling.<br/><br/>The format of the movie itself does have a problem: it does seem odd that they should keep on shooting images, even after things are beginning to unravel. Heather's explanation about this being the only thing left to them sounds silly, simply because we know the real explanation, that is, that if they did not keep the camera going, there would not be any movie anyway. The explanation about how the map gets lost is completely ridiculous: if they had said that the Blair Witch had grabbed it in person it would have been more believable. But taking it as a whole my opinion is positive. I think that the best thing to do about this movie is forget the hype, remember that this is NOT a Hollywood megabudget production and that there are NO special effects, and try to judge the movie on its merits. It is neither a complete disaster nor the best thing invented after pizza. It is just a clever little movie."

The film contians three annoying-as-hell characters which will grate on your nerves for the entire movie.  Indeed, most of what they do is not scary -- they just swear while screaming at the top of their lungs.  If anything in those woods, let alone the ""witch,"" could not hear them, I'd be surprised.  These characters not only yell for most of the movie, they are also some of the dumbest filmmakers I have ever seen -- I had a suggestion for them halfway through: if you would just shut up and actually start moving, you might ACTUALLY GET OUT OF THE WOODS. The producers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" believed that they could make a feasible film by sending three out-of-work pitsy actors into some woods without a script -- guys, it didn't work.

But at the same time I also sensed that the people who undergoes this movie and reviewed it with enormously great amount of satisfaction were the ones that were open minded and they were probably also the ones to comment the movie as a grand horror and thriller movie. Hence the way it was categorized. <br/><br/>And the acting? well lets just say its no ""Casablanca"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" but it was mostly spontaneous reflects. And I sure it was not only obvious to me that the actors/actresses were never given a script to read from.<br/><br/>
I found the ""Blair Witch Project"" to be just a race through the woods. And one of the most realized point of this movie is the fact that one of the kids not only had camping experience, but hiking knowledge, map and compass understanding and skills as well. But under emotional and physical stress all those might have the chance to be forgotten. And still I feel that's a plot hole that should have been covered.<br/><br/>my bottom line is: The ""Blair Witch Project"" is probably tied neck to neck with ""American Beauty"" as the most memorable movie of 1999. So therefore it definitely deserves as the very least to be seen just so you can say you viewed it.<br/><br/>i gave this movie an 5/10 mainly based on the fact that it cheated people out of over 11 million dollars just in theatres when only about 60 thousand dollars were used at the expense of ""The Blair Witch Project"".<br/><br/>Yes, I do recommend this movie, BUT at the same time , THANK YOU HOLLYWOOD!!!!"

The first half hour of the movie is disorienting what with the shaky handheld cam shots.  But this first half hour is essential to know the Blair Witch myth (wish I listened hard, heheh).

What it is, is simply an interesting way of making a movie.  That's it.  The actors don't have much of a script to work with and so most of the scenes are ad libbed.  And the story is constructed as a documentary.  At the end, you feel that you want to know more, but since it's a ""unfinished documentary"" the end is naturally abrupt.

(if it was true); Swearing eventually takes your mind off the actual plot; The guy who throws the map in the water - even HE wouldn't have been that crazy; Make the bloody finger slightly more REAL; Why weren't they more worried about the guy who went missing? If they had showed us SOMETHING of the witch; In 'real life' they would have run out of batteries for the camera (plus if they had changed them why wasn't it recorded on the other video camera???).<br/><br/>Those are all the suggestions I can think of at the moment."

","I think the main reason I went to see the Blair Witch Project was because of all the hype it was given. I'll admit that when I actually saw it, I was a little annoyed, because it was nothing like what it had been advertised as (at least for me.). Don't get me wrong, I liked it, and I though it was a wonderful movie. The bits that really annoyed me where when you would be left in darkness for a few minutes as one of the characters fumbled around in the tent looking for something or when the torch ran out. Being left in the dark, even for a few minutes made me get distracted. Overall, I liked it. I didn't come out very scared- I thought that it was the last 15 minutes that really stuck in my mind. And even now, months after I first saw it, I still wonder about it- what is the Blair Witch? Is she real? The shakey camera got to me a bit, but the movie wouldn't have been good without that effect. It's cast was also wonderful and I thought it was well worth seeing."

","First of all this wasn't the first horror movie that consists out of 'found film material'. This idea was earlier brought by Ruggero Deodato in his film ""Cannibal Holocaust"". The movie is pretty slow and uninteresting in the first half, the second half however comes up with some great suspense. The scenes in the forest can be really frightening. Too bad the end-scene was so predictable."
"smack50","3","0","1","28 March 2000"," Good idea, bad movie.
","Rarely have I ever wasted 90 minutes as badly as when I watched The Blair Witch Project.  This film is constantly alternating between day and night. There's day, which is of course not at all scary, even when the characters find various artifacts presumably left by the Blair Witch.  The day is mostly used to advance the unusually weak plot.  Then there's night, which is remotely scarier than the day, in that it's dark and the hikers hear strange noises around them.  During the night scenes, as soon as I felt remotely frightened at what might happen, the scene would abruptly switch to day.<br/><br/>It is actually just as frightening to hear what this movie is about as it is to watch it, as the film doesn't offer anything beyond its own premise.  If you are scared of darkness, moaning sounds, and college kids, this movie is for you.  Otherwise, you'll be disappointed."

","...did I scare you?<br/><br/>If I didn't then I don't rate BWP chances of doing so either.  In fact the only thing scary about this whole movie was that I paid to see it.  OK, may be I'm being harsh.  It was a really good idea.  But the execution of the concept was poor.  From what I can gather, the premise of the whole film is that it was meant to feel 'real', thus getting away from typical horror. Wonderful idea.  The problem with the film is than no one acts the way any normal human would act in a similar situation.  When totally lost in a big forest, don't just go marching in a general direction, follow the river, it's bound to lead somewhere.  I'm a city boy, but even I know to do that. When face with a big scary house with lots of weird stuff happening, don't go into the house for a quick viewing, run in the opposite direction at high speed.  Perhaps this is somewhat of a British view.  Generally when you wanderer any forest in the UK it will have some associated legend of ghosts, murderers or the like.  You just can't get scared about it. <br/><br/>
However, if the film-makers want to make people believe a story then make it 'real'.  Using camcorders and a documentary style, don't make it 'real', the characters make it 'real'."

The first one doesn't have a happy end, the other one does. The idea of ""showing the students' filmed material"" as is is very effective in terms of creating terror among the spectators, and the result is purposedly shaky and non-professional, but unfortunately creates a lot of empty space, minutes of breathing into the microphone, panning of a forest without any signs of life (the trees included, due to the season). In Finland we have a theater/TV director called Jouko Turkka. His methods of making his actors act include (or rather: consist of) having them drool, make faces, sweat, shake their bodies and cry for extended periods of time, the story being of minimum importance. So, the BWP looks somewhat familiar to me. So familiar that I had to cut down some points.<br/><br/>  But: the movie really is scary.

","The Blair Witch Project terrified me to the bone.

But it all crept back on me when lying in bed, in the dark. This quite shoddily made film doesn't need to use special effects or world famous actors to entertain and scare us, it uses what it has and produces a very effective piece of filming.  The opening lines arouse an air of excitement, and the VITAL information at the very start is creepy at first but then turns to sheer fear later on. I disagree with many who eagerly await sequels. I just think that they will never ever be able to produce that standard again.

These have been used to the point of cliche but, alter the style, they have substance again!   Kudos to the cast and crew for that.  The marketing of this film was slick, especially the borderline War-of-the Worlds style implication that this was a true story.

","The Blair Witch Project was the worst movie and most hyped up film of 1999. The concept was original, but unfortunately the execution of this concept was badly done.  One reason why I thought BWP was bad is that It seem as the movie was made for fun and that they weren't planning to be filmmakers at all.  This change as soon as the film made money and this gave them the idea to direct again.  The success of this movie reminds me of Mel Brooks's The Producers where a play(Spring Time For Hitler)became a surpise success. Another reason this wasn't good is the lack of artistic vision(that is it seems like there wasn't anything put into this film at all by the directors.<br/><br/>
The shack at the end of the movie reminded me of the Freudstein House in The House by the Cemetery(maybe the three college kids were killed not by The Blair Witch but by Dr. Freudstein).  The Blair Witch Project is not as scary as many people would lead others to believe, and it does not contain anything that is scary(rocks found in piles, Twigs formed in shapes, people arguing, and footage of people losing their mind is not my idea of a scary movie).  The actors in the film behave as escapees from an Insane Asylum.  I found that this movie is not as enjoyable as the supernatural thrillers of Mario Bava{The Mask of Satan(1960), Kill, Baby, Kill(1967), and The Whip and The Body(1966)], the surreal films of Dario Argento{Suspiria(1977), and Inferno(1980)], and the gothic/zombie epics of Lucio Fulci{Zombie(1979), The Gates of Hell(1980), The Beyond(1981), and The House by the Cemetery(1981)]. I prefer the cinema of Italian horror to The Blair Witch Project as they are filled with spectacular gore, great camera movement, interesting music, terrific atmosphere, and lots of pizzazz(Things that BWP completely lacks). What annoys me is that people have already start to compare the film-makers to Alfred Hitchcock which is silly as HE IS THE MASTER while they are the students."

People make such a big deal about how low budget this film was because it was only $30, 000 compared to Star Wars or something.  Because people usually hear such big amounts of dollars when a big film is released they instantly think $30, 000 is nothing. Thirty grand is alot of money when you have nothing to show for it.  What the hell did they spend $30, 000 on.  Were all the trees marijuana?  Were they staying in a luxury hotel?  Did they go and buy a used car each? Were the scripts printed on gold?  There is absolutley nothing to show for the $30,000 they spent on this film.  Just some jerky camera work, alot of f words, the most boring 1 hour and 20 minutes of the viewers life and the biggest scam in hollywood history.

The movie gets off to a good start with the interviews with the local population. However, once the students go into the woods the film quickly degrades into a an episode of Friday the 13th. Also, the movie confuses the audience as well as itself by focusing the interviews and the background information largely on the legend of the witch who lives in the forest, but than actualy plays-out another, half-mentioned legend concerning a hermit in those same woods.

","The Blair Witch Project may not be the scariest ever made, but it happens to be the scariest movie I myself have ever seen. It is a truly original work that awakens frightening memories most of us have about being lost and disoriented, while at the same time resurrecting our childhood fears that supernatural forces out there in the wilderness can destroy us if we are not more careful.<br/><br/>Though the film's many strengths lend themselves well to praise and discussion, I would prefer instead to address some criticisms of ""The Blair Witch Project"" that have appeared in these very pages.<br/><br/>Dialogue: <br/><br/>The film has ""bad"" dialogue because the dialogue here is a representation of the way people actually talk, which is not always clever or made up of well-formed sentences. Indeed, since there was no script as such, the dialogue in ""The Blair Witch Project"" *was* the way people actually talked. The exchanges among the players were almost always exactly what you would hear from people of their age group and background. <br/><br/>Sense of reality: <br/><br/>Even in a film like The Blair Witch Project, which tried for as much realism as possible, some compromises must still be made. Those who think it is silly that the characters keep filming each other even in desperate situations, or during heated arguments, are probably missing some fundamental characteristics of the world of film, namely, that during each scene someone must be around to hold the camera. If this had not happened in The Blair Witch Project, that is, if no one had filmed any of the dramatic parts, we probably would not have witnessed the various scenes which make up the movie. As it stands, the air of ""naturalness"" of the actors while in front of the camera is impressive indeed.<br/><br/>Critics on this point, incidentally, are advised to view the Monty Python sketch in which a small group of explorers is fated to die in the jungle. They note pathetically how, at the end of their lives, they have only each other and a bit of film that will record the last minutes of their existence. They then suddenly realize that if they are on film, there must be a crew filming them, and that they are therefore not alone. The crew, which has been a few feet away the whole time, is then shown onscreen, and the explorers rejoice at seeing friendly faces in such a remote location. But then it occurs to them: if this is the crew that was filming them before, who's filming them now?<br/><br/>Kicking the map into the river:<br/><br/>This disturbed me too, at first, but you can easily take a map, get angry at it, crumple it up into a ball, and kick it into the river.<br/><br/>The things the filmmakers find:<br/><br/>As frustrating as it is to accidentally return to a place from which you started out, the element of fear quickly enters into it when you have no suggestions at all on how to proceed and it is also becoming dark. In such a situation, where one is already disoriented and feels the power of nature closing in, the finding of strange objects hanging from trees or of piles of rocks which seem to have appeared out of nowhere (indicating that someone is tracking you!) would be utterly terrifying.  I would wager that most people have in their lives been scared by far less.<br/><br/>Hype:<br/><br/>It's true, this film was hyped practically to death. On the other hand, since it was made for about $30,000, hype was what was needed to sell the movie. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to avoid most of the hype, but even for those who were exposed to so much of it, I think it must have been gratifying to know that the film delivered.<br/><br/>
And I thank you for your time, ladies and gentlemen."
"Jigglypoof","Null","0","1","19 February 2000"," Unique but disappointing.
","My advice - Be glad it's not true, but don't try to find out details about HOW it was made until you see it, or you could ruin it for yourself.<br/><br/>My initial reaction when I first started hearing about this film was, oh my God, that is some scary sh... stuff!  I was genuinely scared to even entertain the possibility that this could have been real.  So I went and did some research, as I do with films I am frightened to see, yet pique my interest.<br/><br/>  Obviously the official site mentions nowhere that the film is neither fiction nor authentic... so that didn't help... but I happened to come across an urban legends site which put my mind at ease.<br/><br/>  As a general rule I am not a fan of horror films, but every once in a while a plot line grabs my attention.  Once I found out that there was minimal gore, I decided to take a chance on it.  Not knowing it was fiction, and had there been showers of blood and guts, it would have sent me into a sheer anxiety and fear... as horror films tend to do with me, and I would still have avoided it like the plague. (Such is the case with Scream 3 - the story intrigued me but I went to others to spoil it because of the hype, and the gore.  I only half watched Scream.)<br/><br/>  I would only watch Blair Witch during the day on a small screen with friends.  Obviously, being in a theater, you are thrust into it and the experience would have to feel ""more real"".  I knew that the story was fiction and so I could reassure myself that it was ""only a movie"". <br/><br/>
  However, knowing details of how the film was made also comforted me, yet made me skeptical.  <br/><br/>  With that in mind, I must say that, while the concept of the film is unique, as you get to see from the victim's point of view, I was disappointed.  Perhaps ONLY knowing that the film was false and that there wasn't any gratuitous violence (or aftermath thereof) would be enough for me to almost enjoy this film.<br/><br/>  I understand that it was even reported here that the actors were deceased, for a time.  It is amazing, and almost sickening, that a story can be so believable that you can forget to mention that it is merely fiction and people will be terrified into near insanity.  Credit must be given to the filmmakers on this genius for believability.<br/><br/>  But, of course, carrying on with that would be sick.  Just hearing how scared people were makes my stomach turn.  Why would a filmmaker decide not to clearly state that it was a work of fiction?  Even to put someone through the anguish is enough to haunt me.  But I'm not here to place blame on the filmmakers.<br/><br/>  With other horror films... even though I KNOW they're not true... they terrorize me with the depiction of graphic violence.<br/><br/>  So, while this is a great idea... the admission that it was fiction is both a blessing to those who believed it, and, in a sense, a disappointment to those who thought it would be like The Exorcist, which, though possibly quite embelleshed, very well could, and does, happen.<br/><br/>  But maybe you should wait until you see the film before you go and find out exactly how it was made.<br/><br/>  Although I guess I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention to the beginning because the ending left me puzzled and asking alot of questions.  It just left me empty.  But that's all I'll say about the ending."

Hitchcock would have been proud. You may have heard all the detractors, concentrating on how these kids could get lost in the woods.

Its central premise and its style of filmmaking is so inventive, and such a healthy kick in the ribs to the tired Hollywood thriller conventions, that I wanted to like this movie more than I was able to. The structure is just a little too loose, and moments of real tension and fright are leavened by far too many more moments of randomness and boredom. Also, I don't feel that the film really *builds* to its climax - you know, squeezes us tighter and tighter into a vise grip; it's simply a pattern of tension and release, tension and release ad finitum until the final attack and then it's suddenly over. Still, like I said, you have to decide for yourself - and if it really works on you and you should like it more than I do. . . well, then I'm envious. I really wish I could like it more."

That's it. Also, I noticed something odd. I've heard that the three actors filmed the entire movie themselves. However, during the frames just after they've realized the map is missing I noticed there must've been a 4th person filming. Heather was sitting on the ground arguing with Josh about who had the map last. Heather isn't holding the camera; she's searching through her pockets. Josh is standing about two feet away looking down at her. He's not holding the camera. And Michael is seen in the distance walking away, further in the woods.

"Sam_Gray","2","0","2","3 February 2000"," a terrible film on several levels (sort of a spoiler, maybe)
","I fail to understand the hype that surrounded this film when it was realized.  It's innovative in that no one has ever done a film like it, true, but that doesn't mean this innovation was a good idea.<br/><br/>First, the idea that people thought the film was real disturbs me.  The fact that the end of the movie is immediately followed by the words ""Written and Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez"" should indicate that the story is fictitious.  And the film isn't even realistic anyway, not if you think about it.<br/><br/>Case in point - I have heard the movie called a ""psychological masterpiece"" even though it is psychologically ridiculous.  Even though the characters are obviously in terrible danger, they continue to film what's happening to them.  One character thinly justifies this by saying that the camera filters reality and makes the situation seem less serious.  I don't buy that, especially not towards the end of the film when the characters know without doubt that something is out to get them.  The fact of the matter is that any real person probably would not only cease filming, but drop the camera all together and run.<br/><br/>A further flaw of the film is its terrible dialogue and relative lack of characterization.  This problem is likely a function of the fact that the directors sent the actors out into the woods alone and allowed them to ""improvise.""  The end result is three one-sided characters that each possess only a single personality trait (for example, Heather is, shall we say, assertive - and nothing else).  Thus, the content of the dialogue amounts to: ""Goodness, this is weird.  Where's the car?""  Just add some cuss words. Oh, yeah, and someone ""kicks"" a map.<br/><br/>What's worse is that the movie is anti-climatic.  Oh, it tries to climax, it just doesn't.  After about ninety or so minutes the film just sort of ends. And the scary part is supposed to be the unseen.  Whatever.  Maybe in some other movie.<br/><br/>I'd give the Blair Witch Project a 2/10, but only because it at least isn't a cliche.  If you really want a good psychological horror, pick up the original Psycho instead."

There are long segments of complete darkness, where you hear whispering but can't even make out what the characters are saying. Who wants to see that? Plus the camera constantly shakes like there's no tomorrow. The images become blurry, repetitive, and boring after awhile. And pretty soon, it's the same old ""chills"" that everyone talks about, repeating themselves countless times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall: Only see this if you do want to see something that has never been done before.

","Blairwitch contained elements and techniques that forged new territory, breathing life into mundane hollywood creating an exciting and original experience(well sort of.) One aspect that stands out is the gritty sense of realism. The use of a documentary as a foundation protrays a first person perspective engulfing the viewer as a participant. The interviews and narration all contributed to what appeared to be genuine footage. The frustration, anger, tension, and fear expressed by the three avid film makers seemed unscripted in real-life fashion, unlike most typical hollywood features where the characters are almost always cool, calm, collective under any situation.<br/><br/>Another perspective used was the fear of vulnerability. Anticipation, darkness, and fear of the unknown are much more stimulating, creating an atmosphere of intensity, then that which we can see and comprehend. Sometimes it is the boundless realms of our imagination that is more disturbing and intriguing then special effects.<br/><br/>Another technique used which i truly enjoyed (much to the dismay of others) was terminal climax(ending the movie suddenly at the climatic point.) This atypical style was perfected in writing by one of the greatest horror writers of all time H.P. Lovecraft. The rush cut abruptly short creates a more emotional impact and drain. Another well known lovecraftian style used was ""open interpretation"" at the end where you are left to draw your own conclusions instead of having everything spelled out for you, making for a more personal viewing experience. Also how the story was created from myth was interesting, but still another H.P. trademark.<br/><br/>Though on the surface this film looks innovative in every way, it is sad to say it was heavily borrowed from ""The Last Broadcast"" which was done several years earlier and better. For the record, the directors of blairwitch later admitted to knowing of the movie but claimed never seen it.Judge for yourself, see both or save the cost of a rental and just see The Last Broadcast. The similarities are more eerie then the movies."

","If a beginning film class at a community college were given the task of adapting a Stephen King short story on video, the results would probably look much like this bewilderingly untalented feature, which is on its way to being the most popular independent film of all time. The two novice directors claim not to have seen Ruggero Deodato's extremely similar (and infinitely superior) CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, though the debt RESERVOIR DOGS pays to Ringo Lam's CITY ON FIRE is chump change in comparison. A snooty-toot documentary filmmaker schleps two guys into the woods of Maryland to record evidence of a fabled serial-killing witch. The two guys fill up the first thirty minutes of the movie with fart-sniffing jokes; then, when you're waiting for something terrifying to be unearthed, the crew is menaced with--a bundle of twigs? A pile of stones? A tooth? The B horror movies of Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur were low on horror and high on atmospherics. Here, in the absence of palpable shocks, you get--twigs. The oafish storytelling, the ""documentary"" surface that wouldn't fool a child in short pants, acting that evokes the adult-entertainment industry--somehow this all spun the buzz machine and turned BLAIR WITCH into the flavor of the nanosecond. Depressingly, a friend called tonight from Houston, Texas, to report that lines curled around two city blocks. This hunk of unutterable junk feels like taps for the independent film movement: the message seems to be, You can be a klutz with a video camera, just as long as you're high-concept.

","Perhaps it's just me, but I didn't find this film all that frightening. Maybe there is a sort of fundamental difference in how Europeans and North Americans respond to this sort of material, based on our cultural heritage? Personally I grew up reading the original Grimm Brothers (rather crude material for a five-year-old) and Disney always struck me as preposterous and stereotyped. So this was hardly anything new. What was new however, was how it was marketed, - and I congratulate the filmmakers on one terrific PR-job. This one must go down in history, I'm sure. I remember seeing the fake documentary about the fake film on TV - and it was severely scarier than the film itself. I guess that was somehow the point. Anything to draw us in. Who cares what we think once we've bought the ticket. The film itself resembled some sort of psychological study more than anything else. Some have complained about the language, but I doubt I'd be any less foulmouthed if I was in the characters' situations - or even the actors' for that matter. I just might whine a little less, but perhaps it actually adds to the credibility of the film to have American college student behave like crybabies. The film did have some finer points however, like the scene where the camera is finally being turned around at 'Heather' and we see her being tormented (by now, I am sure we have all been ardently awaiting it). If anyone still wants to go see this film, I suggest you leave before the end because it will only annoy you, in some desperate attempt of tying the storyline together. Common now - what storyline? Please. You might as well not have bothered. Never the less; my unreserved congratulations to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. Great job, you guys - I hope you made a whole lot of money."

I have to tell you I was not disappointed at all. I loved the whole thing, from the very beginning. As for being a really scary movie, however, I did not really buy into that but my sister watched the whole thing through her hands covering her eyes.<br/><br/>Most of the complaints I have heard about this movie I just don't find viable. For example there being no soundtrack, aren't we always complaining about how unrealistic movies are? Theres no cue in for music in real life either. I thought this was one of the best features of this excellent film.<br/><br/>I also especially loved the shots of when Heather was running around, I really thought they added to atmosphere. They didnt make me feel sick. Heather was annoying but anyone that has worked with a small film project team will know that thats how it really is. I have never heard of an ending quite like hers though. That was great as well.<br/><br/>I can see how this movie has achieved cult status, it definately has in my life. I went camping a few days after seeing it and spent a fair bit of time running around with my video camera ( because I also make docos) yelling ""tell me where you are Josh!!!"".

Some people have told me who are campers that they identified with what was going on and actually scared themselves even more. I don't have that frame of reference.I just didn't buy into it, the premise of the plot was original but it just failed to hook me in due to the poor lighting and bad sound.

If possible you should really check out the Director's commentary on the DVD edition, it really is worth the effort.  The problem is that to review the film you have to forget about this.  What you're left with is an above average film, which promises a lot for its crew's futures.<br/><br/>The three actors are all functional; Heather Donahue really excels though and deserves to go further than this.

","Wanted to add a little something as I was reading down on the comments.  1. Thumbs up to the guy who said it was a comedy.  Hey I agree with you. Though I thought the ending was a tad scary.  That 5 minutes is probably scarier than anything in The Haunting.  But I loved The Haunting far more because of that damn house.  But the biggest problem with THAT movie is it's labeled as a Horror movie.  Not as an adventure movie.  I'd say it almost seems the same creative team behind The Mummy, also did The Haunting. (not a known fact). and 2.  To the person who'll never be alone in the woods again. Hey you'll be missing alot.  I remember once when I was young (88-89 somewhere ) That there was this place (private land, but we had permission) not far from a church out in the country near Lewiston, MN, that was named Ruprects (spelling?) Valley.  We went into a cave , it being small, us guys went over a good pool, spiders and all, and we went way in there on our hands and knees.  Since the girls couldn't make it across that pool, they had to call us back. (I was 1 of only 3 people who bothered to make it all the way in) But anyway... I and 2 girls bothered to get lost in the woods. We though managed to find our way out of that.  Sure I we wound up go a hill at an 80% incline, but what the hell.  This is the reason I have to laugh at this most unrealistic movie.  It was shot very well (or should I say they were radical in doing so), but watching three people swear in the woods, isn't what I call scary as hell....."

"Denver53","5","0","2","30 December 1999"," Not scary, but interesting
","I'm beginning to believe there is a dividing line between those who liked TBWP and those who didn't that is often based on age. The post-25-year-olds seem to, for the most part, view the film as so-so and not scary. Many of the under-25 viewers like it very much and find it innovative and terrifying.<br/><br/>I'm over 25, so you can guess where I fall on that continuum. Blair Witch was interesting primarily as a study of three people freaking out, not as a horror movie. Much has been written about the low budget and primitive technique. Yes, it is primitive, and that adds a certain mystique. It is like watching old home movies. It's so bad it is interesting to see how the filmakers will get a story across with so little apparent ability to do so. But to me, that isn't a point of contention. The quality of the film technique is what it is.<br/><br/>The story itself is basic. Three young film students set out to do a documentary about a ghost legend. You don't learn much about the students beforehand, and they have little depth. Most of what you learn comes from watching the group dynamics of the threesome as their situation gets worse and each individual starts to break down. From that perspective, TBWP was interesting. It also gets very annoying, as they begin to yell at each other and become irrational over what appears to be simply noises in the woods and some related odd goings on.<br/><br/>The lack of reasonable behavior by the threesome is what ultimately turned me off. I'll avoid giving away too much here, but will state a two examples:<br/><br/>1. When the students become lost and lose the map, they show very little ability to reason out an escape route based on the direction of the creek and the position (east - west) of the sun. If they had a map before, and saw the creek on it, and then find the creek, how hard can it be to follow the creek in a direction that gets them to safety? Can't they remember what was on the map, at least the basics?<br/><br/>2. The film lost all believability when the filmakers, especially the female star, continued to shoot video of what were supposed to be horrifying and sudden developments. I could see taping *after* the developments, when a little time had passed for the students to adjust. But *during*? I don't know about you, but if I find bloody remains the last thing I am doing as I find them is filming, and zooming in and out on them while also screaming my head off. <br/><br/>That was the problem. How could a person be calm enough to film something frightening, while at the same time screaming and generally losing it in fear? It is hard to believe that one person is doing both simultaneously. And every time that happened, I remembered I was watching a movie, and these people weren't real, and anything that happened wasn't scary. I suppose if the camera were a small, helmet-mounted unit that taped automatically it would have worked better. But just a little.<br/><br/>In the end, The Blair Witch Project was interesting but certainly not worth the hype. I wonder how many people have homemade ""story"" videos in their tape collections that include plots of the same quality? Probably a lot."

","Past the fact that the incessant profanity just about kills any feeling I might have for the desperate characters in ""The Blair Witch Project"" (I side with the people who view it this way:  Three pottymouths disappear off the face of the earth and good riddance.), one of the elements of a good thriller for me will always be the resourcefulness of the people who populate the story.  The point of this movie is that somehow these three unfortunates fall under some kind of parapsychological spell that disorients them to such an extent that they lose their way out of a touchy situation.  It's like an updated Hansel-and-Gretel story without the woodsman to save the wanderers from the wicked witch.  The reason why I have a hard time going with the premise of ""Blair Witch"" is that I cannot understand Heather's obsession with filming the event.  If I were bent on getting out of that blasted forest, I would not be carrying a camera around to film it.  I also would not be photographing an apology to my parents for putting myself in this desperate situation.  Frankly, I would be praying that God would get me out of that situation--and fast.  This is why I can't side with the people that find this movie haunting; the basic premise comes across as a gimmick--an intellectual conceit, and the potential power of it is lost on me.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that I expect the actress playing Heather to be a favorite for an Oscar nomination.  The legend and the history of the Blair Witch is a far more compelling story.  Catch the documentary on the SciFi channel.  I found it much scarier."

When viewed as a piece of fiction, the Blair Witch Project is not particularly scary. If approached as a factual documentary, it is much spookier. The moral is this; find out as little as possible about the film before you see it. It is also important to note that anyone expecting another teen hack-and-slash gorefest and a storyline off the back of a cornflakes box will not enjoy this film.

She was said to have lured young children into her house and then to have slaughtered them. <br/><br/>Three student filmmakers Heather Donahue, Mike Williams & Josh Leonard decided to make a documentary on the Blair Witch. Before the students went into the woods they interviewed many people asking them about what they know about the Blair witch. After all that they got their 2 8mm film cameras and headed deep in the woods. Along the way they encountered many attacks, especially at night. <br/><br/>They are suspicious because after each attack they find rock piles around their tent. This leads up to the biggest movie of the 20th century. If you like a thrill or if you're a horror addict then this is right up your alley. The Blair Witch Project is not physically scary (you don't see anything that is scary) But it is Mentally scary (You see the expression on their faces and hear the sounds that they hear).

That would be scary.  But would it be a good movie?  No.  And neither was the Blair Witch Project.  Bottom line is, being lost in the woods at night and having some unknown thing chasing and terrorizing you certainly is scary.  And the filmmakers added the slightest bit of intelligence in the last second of the movie with Mike's placement. However, the rest of the movie is plain old boring and is not worth 5 cents much less the $2 I rented it for.

","I saw this movie on the weekend, and read the reviews. I agree, and disagree, with many of them.<br/><br/>UNLIKE some, I was impressed with the way this flick was handled, the story was intriguing. The three students Josh, Heather and Mike were excellent, I actually sympathized with them and felt their fear at being alone and lost in the forest for 4 nights with unseen evil forces stalking them until... (And I don't normally sympathize with characters in movies!)<br/><br/>The concept of relying on your imagination to fill in what nasty surprises the 3 students encountered was great! (For example: the stick figures) This is what real fear is, and that concept is what I enjoyed!! This was by far the BEST and most realistic horror movie I have seen.<br/><br/>The comparing of this with stuff like Scream 2, was unfair. The BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is much better than SCREAM 2! It was a great change from seeing the usual blood-splashed horror flicks,  loaded with one cliche after another.<br/><br/>
HOWEVER there was a downside, and that was the annoying, jiggling filming. It would've looked better if it were 'professionally' filmed, rather than done in this style. It can still look grainy like the film WAS found a year later without looking like it had been filmed by 3 year olds... (sorry!) It didn't really add authenticity even though it tried to... We had a lot of scenes which were unnecessary. It was very frustrating sitting there while the students were running around panicking, camera pointing at ground, tree, sky, ground, etc etc etc<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: Ah, ha! So that's what car sickness feels like!!! This movie is very scary psychological-wise, so if you can stand the screen jumping crazily without being sick, this is for you!! Those who want blood and gore, and a story handed to them on a platter, should avoid at all costs."

","As scary as The Exorcist? No way!<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is however unsettling, memorable; one of those films that can leave you with thoughts and flashbacks for days.<br/><br/>It has an unnerving, believable feel encouraged by apparently very real reactions from the actors. But such flamboyance is never accidental.<br/><br/>The film for all of its apparent naturalness is carefully set up.<br/><br/>I'd like to emphasise that the actors are still alive! I've been amazed by the number of people who believe that the whole thing is real!<br/><br/>This film has taken on a life of its own. There was and still is a very successful internet presence for the movie. Film site surfers have become the nucleus of a solid and enthusiastic retinue of fans itching for a certain kind of scare.<br/><br/>Younger film goers find it very fashionable to have seen the film, resulting in a cult phenomenon that is in full swing. Seeing this movie is a bit like owning the best designer wear.<br/><br/>Perversely, the fact that The Blair Witch Project was made for only a pittance by a couple of  film students, has given the film street credibility.  It has low budget (big profit) grunge glamour.<br/><br/>But mainly people are flocking to see this because they're looking for a good scare.<br/><br/>But they don't want to be terrified. Most people never want that in movie houses. The fact that The Blair Witch Project is about as frightening, and has the same air, as a ride on an amusement park Ghost Train isn't a huge disincentive for the teen audience to whom this film will really appeal.<br/><br/>So what of the film. We are told during the opening credits that in 1994 three film makers went into a wooded  area in search of a legendary witch: ""A year later, their footage was found.""<br/><br/>The film makers were never seen again, but from their film we find out what happened to them. A documentary is made and that's The Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>This film was written and directed by two young American auteurs, Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick. They conceived the idea, scripted the film (without dialogue), trained their three main actors Heather Donahue, Michel Williams, and Joshua Leonard for two days on how to work the cameras and sent them into the woods to make this ""documentary"".  Of course we don't see the rest of the production crew.<br/><br/>This worked remarkably well. The actors, able to ad lib at will while they were doing the filming threw themselves into this horror story. They probably at times frightened themselves.<br/><br/>Sanchez and Myrick then spent eight months editing the footage, getting it to look as much as possible like a rough story  of the deaths of three terrified people.<br/><br/>The film is grainy, the cameras hand held and the editing rough. The original mood is jocular when the trio begin their project with some lead up interviews with local fishermen and the like, boning up on the folk lore that surrounds the myth of the Blair Witch.<br/><br/>They go to the woods. As the days progress and the witch closes in, the tension mounts like in all good horror movies. The three start to bicker with one another. Formerly subservient characters become more dominant. A leader makes a tearful confession to the camera.<br/><br/>And what of the camera. The desire to document is only one reason for keeping filming. Why do they keep filming as they even die?<br/><br/>The answer has never been more obvious. Watching the world through a lens is like wearing a mask or taking on another personality, or acting. It divorces the camera operator from what he or she is seeing through the lens.<br/><br/>And that's damn handy if something horrible is trying to murder you.<br/><br/>And if you're filming as you are running, especially in terror, the camera will swing. Those prone to motion sickness might be disorientated."

This movie certainly is different. Still though, it lacks what good film needs. Namely, the basics.

Originality will be missing in the next installment.<br/><br/>As cultural phenomenon, I can only guess at its success. The characters speak in a pseudo cool youth speak, in which the F word is noun, adjective, and verb,often in the same paragraph. Well, that may be fine if you live in the vernacular.

","Both GODZILLA and THE PHANTOM MENACE,I believe, were destroyed by hype. The former had a kicky trailer which the movie couldn't amount to and the latter was in need of script revisions and lots of them.<br/><br/>But what separates these two examples from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is that they were big budget ""event"" movies, STAR WARS especially. PROJECT, was a sleeper horror cheapie with a cool, innovative gimmick. It's supposedly the missing pieces of documentary footage left by a missing trio of filmmakers researching the legendary Blair Witch. The movie is pretty much segments of color video or black and white 8mm film. This is an interesting concept and a cool idea, but it doesn't make the movie especially scary.<br/><br/>What attracted me to the movie in the first place was first the cool idea that attracted most film purists, and later on, the rumors I overheard. People running out of theaters and getting sick (due to, I later found out, the shaky camera movements).<br/><br/>But watching PROJECT, especially near the end, I kept thinking of the ""directors"", who didn't seem to do much but edit the movie, since the talent had to shoot the film. I imagined them laughing and rolling in a big pile of money as we were getting jipped from a promising horror movie. All this movie turns out to be is a gimmicky pseudo-documentary with noises in the woods and missing campers.<br/><br/>I realize that it's as hard to scare the bejesus out of an audience as much as it is to make them laugh out loud and hopefully break down to the floor. And due to that consideration, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is an average horror flick, which will probably be looked back as a classic like NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, due to its clever style of using video and film and its dirt-cheap budget. The actors are good with their improvisations and the ending is a true chiller.<br/><br/>If you are curious about the film, I guess it would be worth seeing. It's better than your generic Hollywood slasher flick. But don't be prepared to be scared out of your wits. Don't expect this movie to be the scariest ever made. The scariest movie ever made is yet to BE made!"

Maybe it was because of the hype, but I was expecting to see just a little more scary stuff, and it would have been better if it had been 15-20 min. longer. And I saw nothing that would have made me sick, but then again, I'm a nurse and do things with the most disgusting stuff humans can produce.

","I had heard so much about this movie both good and bad, so I had to see it. I'm just happy that I didn't pay for it. Because even though it only runs 80 min, it feels like two hours. Nothing happens and because it's filmed by hand held cameras most of the time you can't see or hear anything. Blank screen! Maybe if you believed that these film students really died, and that they where killed by a real witch, it could have been scary. But since this is obviously not the case, because the Blair Witch legends was invented for this movie, this is not a factor for me. Some of the people I saw it with was very scared, when I was bored? They at least had some fun out of it. Except for the last three minutes nothing happens!<br/><br/>I think it was a great stunt, to convince America that this was a true story, and the best thing that came out of this movie, must have been all the stuff on the net. That the only commercials was on the net was very smart. I guess that if I and a lot of other people don't like this movie, the creators will probably cry on their way to the bank with all their millions.<br/><br/>I gave it 4 out of 10 for it's new thinking alone.

Instead, I found that it was quite absurdly amusing in a number many ways: First, the characters just losing it and freaking out, Mike especially, was funny. It was understandable for them to be frustrated by the situation but they didn't do much to resolve it, instead they worsened it. Then secondly, we had Heather, despite being supposedly upset, frustrated, scared or losing it, had the ever present video recorder or 16mm camera by her side -- I mean, right up to the end!. How unrealistic and absurd is that? Too funny. Then thirdly, the plain stupidity of the characters -- hello?!? -- follow the path of the river or stream, that's should be in that ""survival"" camping book you showed us earlier. And how dumb can you be to have a map and a compass and not find your way home, but instead, throw away the map and get mad then tape it all! Ridiculous! Then the ending was a complete joke.

","There's nothing worse than hype, I however had done my best to avoid it as much as I possibly could, still the overbearing view that this was ""supposed"" to be the scariest movie of all time did cross my mind when I went to see it, and then again at the end of it when I walked out of the cinema completely unaffected by what I saw.  if you read other peoples comments they'll say it was either the scariest film or the worst, I tend to agree more with the latter, although I can see the potential behind the idea, and the fact is, the film gets you talking regardless.

","You go to the cinema, you sit down with your popcorn, you watch a film, you come out and talk about it with friends, go home and forget it.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film ask you to think for yourself as it is essentially a passive entertainment. This is what The Blair Witch Project attempts to subvert.<br/><br/>Okay, the reactions are those of Heather, Josh and Michael but it is possible to identify more closely with these characters than the standard victims/heroes or horror films. They don't do what we would consider the obvious things - like follow the river downstream - to get out of trouble. They are arrogant, inarticulate, stupid and frightened. Just like us. Just as we probably would be in the same situation - cold, running out of food, hunted.<br/><br/>And that's what we're not used to seeing on film. Traditionally, main characters act upon events to influence their own destiny. It is the support cast who are quickly sketched and lack motivation and therefore have ""Will be holding own entrails in fingers in the next five minutes"" invisibly tattooed across their forehead. Here, the three principals try to convince themselves they have some idea of what they're doing even though we know, and perhaps subconsciously, they know, they are doomed.<br/><br/>The Maryland woods with their cold, dry sticks and leaves are a perfect setting. For a good example as to how the countryside can be a strange place for alien visitors, The Blair Witch Project ranks up there with Picnic at Hanging Rock.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project isn't the scariest film you'll ever see but it is genuinely unsettling in the same way Jaws is. Just as we all laugh at the big fake shark but wonder if we really should swim out too far in murky water, we might think twice about camping out in woods in the autumn.<br/><br/>Forget the hype. or rather enjoy the hype for what it is. Well thought out and creative hype but watch the movie by itself. Let yourself get involved, get drawn in. Don't expect the film to do all the work for you. Remember your imagination? Use it. Close the distance between you and the characters and believe."
"Amanda Roberta-5","Null","0","1","14 November 1999"," Original but slightly repetitive
","I must admit I was quite curious about BWP.  In my country (Malta) the film received mixed reviews; some critics found it fascinating while others downright loathed it.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project came as a bit of a surprise.  I expected to see some form of introduction, perhaps a couple of detectives going showing the video of the documentary to the families of the three students who disappeared into thin air. Instead a couple of sentences informed me that three students had been lost in Maryland while shooting a documentary video on the Blair Witch.  A year later, video footage was found, and that is what the film is going to be about.<br/><br/>Getting used to the picture size was the hardest part of all.  It took me all of fifteen minutes to focus properly and get into the story.<br/><br/>The strongest point of the film is that it is so 'natural'. And after reading what the actors had to go through (they were woken up in the middle of the night, were made to walk on hungry stomachs and other not-so nice ordeals) I can understand why this is so.  The scene where Heather talks into the camera and apologizes to the boys' families is really touching - he tears are real, her fear almost tangible. It is as if she was really there, lost, afraid, feeling responsible for all this; for it was HER idea after all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this was all that there was to the film.  The filming itself was very crude; and although it is innovative it starts to get to you after a while.  I also found the locations very samely and sometimes the film got a bit too repetitive for my liking (i.e. the three students walk during the day and camp during the night, with not much going on except for the tension building up slowly between them).<br/><br/>That said, I quite liked the climax at the end.  It really took me by surprise and made me understand the movie for what it is..  However, the great ending still did not wipe from my mind the idea that the film looks like nothing more than an amateur documentary - in spite of the rave reviews it has received in the US."

","The Blair Witch promised so much, and in my opinion delivered very little. I tried to go into the cinema with an open mind, not pre-judging the film. I did however expect a eerie, unnerving film that would make me leave the cinema feeling slightly uneasy. This was simply due to the massive success it had received in the states. However it did not deliver any of the above aspects in my opinion.<br/><br/>I felt that the use of hand held cameras did increase the sense of realism, and the acting from the cast is 100% perfect, there is nothing I can fault with them, they really gave across the feeling that they were completely in despair, not knowing where to go and what to do,this however could not cover up the problems with the film.<br/><br/>There will be many people who will watch the film and enjoy it emensly, I suppose I have a tendency to analyze a film to much, maybe it stems from my vast movie watching experience.<br/><br/>I just felt that it fell into to many of the classic horror movie cleches, which I would have though the writers would have tried to stay well away from, others may not notice them. I think my main problem was due to the fact that because they only have hand held camera, due to the fact that the film is supposed to have been made up from the recovered film reels, everything that you see has to be filmed by the actual film makers. This however raises problems, an example could be when one of the team is filming a disturbing scene and is screaming hysterically but still continues to film and also at one point actually zooms in on the subject. Is this really what a person would do, I imagine most people would turn and get the hell out as fast as humanly possible. I understand there is little you can do with scenes like this as there is no 3rd party filming, but they should have thought the scenes through better. You could have written it as thought they made a another film at the same time, the second being the film of themselves doing the documentary, this would have allowed scenes to be included which could have dealt with the previous scene.<br/><br/>My only advice is to watch the film with an open mind, and try not to analyze to much, and you should be able to enjoy it as simply a medium thriller, if you are expecting the scariest movie since the exorcist then you are in for a big shock."

","...and that's not a compliment. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is right behind ""The Phantom Menace"" as the year's most overrated movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to say what this movie's BIGGEST problem is, but we can start with the characters, a trio of whiny, self-absorbed idiots that will absolutely annoy the crap out of you. Watching these clowns from a first-person perspective is like watching a feature-length ""Real World"" episode (which is a terrifying proposition in itself). I, for one, was rooting for the witch, and it's hard to take the movie seriously when you WANT the ostensible heroes to die.<br/><br/>Believability is also a huge problem, for one very simple reason: Nobody in their right mind would have continued filming as long as these people did. They just wouldn't, ESPECIALLY while running through the woods at NIGHT while in a state of complete panic. Now, this may sound like nitpicking, but in order for ""Blair Witch"" to work we've got to BELIEVE that we're watching actual footage, taken in a situation and a state of mind as horrific as the students were in. It is simply beyond belief that they would have the presence of mind to continue filming as their situation becomes a fight for survival.<br/><br/>And overall the movie was - dare I say? - boring. Just plain dull. I wasn't drawn into the situation; I wasn't even remotely scared until the last five minutes (after which the movie just stops - it doesn't end, it just STOPS), mainly because I was so tired of listening to the annoying main characters bicker. This is a tiresome movie.<br/><br/>Now, I know this is supposed the be the ""scariest movie of all time""; I know I probably missed the point, that these people were SUPPOSED to be annoying (in order to appear more ""real""); that the production values were supposed to be incredibly cheap (""reality"" again), and that the horror was supposed to be entirely SUGGESTED without us actually seeing anything scary, along with various other ""artistic"" reasons that filmmakers like this feed us when they don't really feel like actually making a horror movie.

I like to think that I enjoy engrossing myself in movies (er, films, I mean), so I happen to hold the former opinion.<br/><br/>In trying to decide why this clear duality of opinions exists, I came to the conclusion that you have to let the movie scare you; you have to put yourself in the tent with these three, you have to imagine what it would be like to be totally lost in the woods with all sorts of creepy stuff happening around you. I think that those who didn't get scared by the movie either couldn't do that, for lack of imagination, or their subconscious wouldn't let them, as some sort of defense mechanism. I did notice that the older the person I talked to, the more likely they were to think it was stupid.<br/><br/>And I'll be honest, for the first hour or so, I thought it was kind of dumb myself. I thought, rolling my eyes, that I was watching MTV's ""The Real World Goes Camping"", but my eyes stopped rolling when the noises at night began. I didn't even admit that I was scared by the movie until I was at home that night in a dark house, jumping at every little noise.

I've read stories that viewers in theaters around the country have become sick while watching this movie. Perhaps this is due to the unsteady and excessive motion of the camcorder video.

The giggling teens are down in front, just where they should be. And the couple next to you is noisily plundering their giant barrel of popcorn with metronomic efficiency.  But it doesn't matter.   Because soon, safe in the hands of a reasonably competent filmmaker, you expect to be magically transported to a beautiful, surreal world in which an interesting story unfolds. But suddenly, instead, something pops on the screen, which has the look and feel of your uncle Bob's vacation video.  I mean, it's all there: the shaky image, the lens's flares, the jagged transitions.<br/><br/>
Well, welcome to the new age of cinema.  Because now, thanks to the Blair Witch Project, the bar has been sufficiently lowered so that virtually ANYONE can make a movie.  In fact, as long as one is willing to disregard certain cinematic standards - or, standards in general - all one needs is a camcorder and, well, not much else.  Because here's the deal: that crappy video is supposed to make us think this is real.  Get it?<br/><br/>
So class, what do we learn from this latest attempt at cinema verite?<br/><br/>Well, the first thing is you obviously don't need special effects to fill the seats The second thing TBWP proves is that you don't need actors either.  Just three typical twenty-somethings will suffice, who look, act and talk - by and large - pretty stupid.<br/><br/>In fairness though, that's also one of the good points of this goofy tribute to bad video (a fair amount of the time, the screen is actually blank.): the dialogue and behavior of these three young people is authentic and believable.  And so is the group's gradual descent into a kind of  Lord Of The Flies morale-crisis - especially when the trio of 2 young men and their ballsy female leader begins to realize they are lost.<br/><br/>Despite being occasionally effective however, you'll find the story itself to be barebones.  Basically, here's the setup:  these three aforementioned yokels go into the woods to do a documentary on the Blair Witch, a subject of some fairly scary local folklore. By the middle of the film, it appears as if they really do find something dangerous.  In fact, aided by intentionally inferior production values, the film generates a creepy frisson throughout so that finally every tree in the forest looks suspicious.<br/><br/>But trust me, the scariest thing about this rip off is how boring it is. Indeed, as we are drawn toward the inevitable cop-out ending, all I eventually wanted was to see these 3 lamebrains get killed - hopefully in the most horrible and disgusting manner possible.  That's how annoying they - and this movie - become.<br/><br/>Actually, I lied about the scariest thing in TBWP.  The ultimately frightening horror of this movie is the way major reviewers are fawning over it, comparing it to Psycho and other classics.<br/><br/>But I digress.  You really should still see this baby - hopefully in a theatre That way if anyone asks you if the Blair Witch actually 'gets' anyone,  you can show them your ticket stub and say, ""Yup.  She got me - for $5.00.""<br/><br/>As for the producers of the inevitable rip-offs which will follow, 3 words of advice:  DIGITAL IMAGE STABILIZATION."

","***** out of *****<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is a movie worth watching. Being already a cinematographic phenomenon I think deep analysis should be made. Miryck and Sanchez have accomplished something only Hitchcock in Psycho, Carpenter in Halloween, Kubrick in The Shining, dePalma in Carrie and Spielberg in Jaws had before.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of people are (and will be) disapointed, because this film is not a ""fright"" film. You don´t see the murderer running behind his victim or listen a creepy frightening violin chord every time the director wants you to get scared. It is not a movie filled with popular teen TV stars dressed in the latest fashion clothes geting butchered.<br/><br/>
This movie is about what really scares us. I think movies like Scream, Scream 2, I Know..., I Still Know..., Urban Legend, etc are good horror movies, but the kind of fright they make you feel is the kind of terror you feel when someone is holding a gun to your face to robe you. The Blair Witch...manages that kind of pain you feel when you´re alone at night in your house and suddenly you hear a creak or a noise and you don´t know its origin, where it came from... It could be anything...And that is more frightening.<br/><br/>Heather, Josh and Mike are such excellent actors and the movie is filmed and edited in such a way that the desperation, the nervousness and the fear they feel are transmitted to you automatically. The creepy and eerie aspect of the trees in the night (and even by day) contribute to the excellent atmosphere created here and its necesary to make you feel there... with them, being the fourth student on the project. This is not a fast paced movie. In an intelligent move, it takes its time and starts slowly, increasing speed in the second act and finally ending in a way that you´ll feel someone has crashed you against a glass window at 500 miles per hour. Believe me, it´ll leave your heart pounding a lot of time after you leave the theater. Just remember terror lies not in what you see, but in what you hear and don´t kow where it comes from...and can´t see...<br/><br/>Warning: Watch the Documentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" and visit the official site before you watch the movie...you´ll enjoy it more..."

Of those thirty minutes, twenty-two of those could have possibly been turned into an effective made for t.v. Halloween special.  {I have yet to see the film's companion piece which aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Perhaps they were able to salvage something redeeming from the sedative I sat through)<br/><br/>Regarding the film's elements, had you cut out every utterance along the lines of {""What the F*** is goin' on here, man?"", followed by an ever impressive ""I don't F***in' know, man!""}, the movie would be maybe 55 minutes long (a generous estimate).  Cut out the frequent and equally uninspired banter about their map, you are down to 35 minutes (seemingly).<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I found myself amazed (at times perplexed and insulted) at this group's lack of common sense.  For instance; if you are lost in the woods and come across a running stream, follow the water downstream.  Odds are you will stumble upon signs of civilization sooner or later.  Some more good advice is to never part from camp in search of a comrade BEFORE daybreak, lest ye become lost yourself.<br/><br/>I have noticed that people who like this movie say that people like myself (antagonists) have no imagination.  That those disappointed by Blair Witch were uneducated, searching for ""Freddy and Jason"" to jump out and slay all. Not so.  It is my belief that Blair Witch suffered from ""Phantom Menace syndrome"".  Which simply means I was unable to empathize with any of these characters.  Whether they were running for their lives or desperately lost and wandering aimlessly through the woods.  Nothing.<br/><br/>Yes, I understand that this was an ""indie"" flick.  Filmed in only eight days using improve and costing only $25,000.  But to call it the freshest thing to grace the silver screen is irresponsible and completely false.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but this film did nothing but make me mad.  My final observation (the last time I waste cranial function on ""the Blair Witch Project"") is this; there is only one instance in this movie (two of them converse after one is lost.) where if you get up to retrieve a beverage, you will miss the only two minutes in the film spent on character development.  As for the rest of the film, I have seen more passion in a turnip.<br/><br/>Anyway ""I want my money back.""  Do not waste your time."
"swansong-2","Null","0","1","12 November 1999"," Just want to put my two cents in...(possible spoiler)
","I had heard much about this movie (who hasn't???) and had been impressed with what I'd heard.  Fright without gore, film without script, eerie without special effects that cost more money than it takes to feed a small country for five years.  I liked that.  I was really looking forward to seeing this.  In fact, I was so pumped about this movie, that I bought it for myself without watching it first.  I have never done that in my life. Just thought I'd let ya know.  I had planned to watch this movie on Halloween night, but unfortunately, it didn't work out that way, so my husband and I watched it about four days later.  Here are the results, for anyone who cares to know:<br/><br/>My husband fell asleep half-way through it, and when he finally did see the end, he didn't seem all that affected.<br/><br/>I almost had a heart attack by the end of the film, and was not able to sleep for the following two nights.<br/><br/>Therein lies the problem with this (in my opinion) wonderful movie.<br/><br/>I was reading through the reviews on this page before I decided to add my humble opinion, and it would appear that about 90% of you feel that you have been royally ripped off and that you deserved better than this movie for the amount of money you spent on the movie tickets, popcorn, cola, and gargantuan chocolate bars you consumed in your boredom.  I am not surprised by this reaction.  After seeing this movie, I actually expected it.<br/><br/>Most horror movie fans are used to being visually splattered with gore, and being audibly goosed by high violins and loud bass (not to mention being visually tantalized by young starlets in barely-there clothing screaming before being sliced into chicken salad).  Those of you used to this sort of horror are accustomed to seeing all of the action, knowing who the bad guy is (or knowing that there IS a bad guy), watching the blood spurt all over the screen, and generally having a gay ol' time at the expense of the poor folk retching in the back row.  Scares are bloody, fright is gory, fear is something that is associated with a sharp instrument, lots of violins, jumping out of nowhere so as to slice up some pretty young filly (or handsome young stud, now -- see?  Women's lib IS making a difference!) with gratuitous use of blood bags, special effects, snappy editing, and sheep's intestines.  This is not a bad thing, only different.  My husband is one of you.  My theory is that this is the reason my husband and you were napping in your seats and throwing popcorn at screen when the inconclusive ending made it's fateful appearance.<br/><br/>I, however, am one of those sensitive souls who feel queasy at the sight of a paper cut.  I am unable to watch ""Paramedics"", or even ""M*A*S*H"", due to the danger of seeing some form of blood, dismemberment, or mutilation on the screen.  I admit it, I'm a wimp.  I am not ashamed of this, but it, unfortunately, means that I am unable to be scared in the way that I wish. The sort of horror movies that I like haven't been made since Hitchcock died.  I prefer my horror to be performed offscreen.  I find my imagination is more terrifying than ANYTHING that modern movie-magic gurus can possibly create.  All I need is a scene of a closed door, in a dark hallway, and to hear a person screaming on the other side of it, to keep me awake for days to come.  I can only imagine what sort of horrors that poor individual is experiencing -- imagining them is much more terrible.  If I SAW them, I would spend the rest of the movie in the bathroom tossing up my popcorn, thereby wasting $7 on a movie ticket.  This is why this movie affected me so.  A dark night in a forest, alone in a tent with no supplies or weapons, and you can distinctly hear voices and screaming, the high-pitched laughter of children, the cracking of twigs under unseen feet...I dare anyone to tell me that if it were them, they would not be peeing in their jeans.  And as for the reviewers who feel the emotion of the three characters is out of place here, let me ask you this:  you're lost in a forest for over three days, weird, unexplained things have been happening to you, night brings strange sounds, morning brings you signs that you're not alone out there...would you be a cool cucumber?  Or would you be crying hysterically, holding yourself, rolled in a little ball and rocking back and forth, begging for God to deliver you out of this place?  I find it hard to believe that anyone could honestly look me in the eye and tell me the former.  You'd crack.  You know you would.  You're only human after all...horror fan or not."

","I had high hopes about this film, I thought it would be maybe just as scary or even scarier than a horrorflic like Halloween because Halloween was also a very lowbudget film. But, scary? No f***ing way!!!!!! The camerawork, the characters and the story were pretty realistic but not all of the time. The film was to short and didn't have, as far as I know, any real scary moments. The ending of the film was one of the worst and most sudden I've ever seen. I think it's unbelievable that this film has made so much money, all the hype made this movie seem one of the best ever made, but in essence it is a pretty big flop. It's amazing that I still give it a 6 out of a 10, but that's only because the style of the film is very original when compared with other movies and it has it's realistic moments. My vote of 6 for this movie can easily be a lot lower."

","Having seen this movie after hearing so much about it I cannot be but disappointed. While the plot is fairly original and the film is atmospheric I find it impossible to relate to or sympathise with the characters. It is clear that this film appeals to a younger American movie audience, but I suspect older Europeans like me might not be that keen about it, even if they are horror film fans (and I am)."
"kyoung-2","3","0","1","8 November 1999"," Laughable
","I thought the trailer combined with the web site was scarier than the movie itself.  I was into it, except for the constant swearing, until they made it into the woods.<br/><br/>At that point they lost me.  I was amazed that they could be that terrified and still have the awareness to keep the camera rolling and pointed in the right direction.  Let's face it running through the woods in the middle of the night is tough enough, but to hold a video camera up to head level and try to do it would be crazy.<br/><br/>If they had wanted to have done this right (not that it really would have helped.  I don't think anything could have done that), they should have combined the movie and tv special.  Put clips from the TV at the beginning of the movie so you get a sense of what was going on, what happened, and who the blair witch was.  Then go into the ""recovered"" film.  But I guess you don't make enough money like that.<br/><br/>If nothing else this movie is a triumph for mass marketing and hype."
"BigB","7","0","1","8 November 1999"," Overrated and not scary, it's still worth seeing.
","This has to be one of the most overrated horror films of all time, and it ended up not being even remotely scary. Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile film to see, and I applaud the fact that it was made. Being from the West Coast where conifers dominate the forests, East Coast forests seem like a park to me; this seriously detracted from the suspense. If they had added a very subtle soundtrack, such as that in ""Twin Peaks"", it would have added to the suspense, and wouldn't have subtracted from the documentary feel of the film. Despite these shortcomings, I wasn't bored with the film, nor disappointed that it wasn't frightening for me. I found it far more interesting and enjoyable than many other films these days; in that sense, it deserves its praise."
"Big O-7","6","0","1","11 November 1999"," A unique experience
","May contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Well, I finally got around to seeing this summer sensation.  At first I felt like I should be hopping on the anti-BWP band wagon that inevitably follows every successful movie (FORREST GUMP is a prime example).  But I can't.  The film is nowhere near great in its execution (though kudos go to the three leads ... they are more than up to the task, and they deliver the goods). It was an odd experience for me since I just picked up Stephen King's THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, a shorter novel about getting lost in the woods. Back to BWP.  The premise works.  What does not work is some of the irritating camera work, the fact that the girl (who is ""directing"" a documentary) does less directing than her crew, and the way that the BW is shown.  But the premise is strong, and the forrest turns out to be the real bad guy.  Overall rating ... a 6.  For a better scare (or a nice double or triple feature) check out Michael Rooker in HENRY:  Portrait of a Serial Killer, or Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM."
"Kahlan","Null","0","1","6 November 1999"," My Humble opinion
","OK, I've just come back from the cinema. This is my immediate opinion of The Blair Witch Project'.<br/><br/>Some said it was the most terrifying film ever and others said it was the biggest load of rubbish.  While not the scariest film ever, it does make you think. Myself and 7 friends (all girls aged 16-18) went to see it. The film has been hyped up so much I honestly was not expecting much, something along the lines of a low budget Scream' set in the forest (I was not impressed with Scream'). Or this generations The Exorcist', a film which, in my opinion, is laughable (I did laugh when I saw it). But I must admit that I was quite mistaken.<br/><br/>While watching the film you're not that scared. True there are some tense moments, the part where they're in the tent and it's like someone's pushing at it from the outside while there are crying noises, or when they wake up and find the 3 mounds of stones around the tent. Or how about those little stick figures strewn all over the place? And the children's hand prints on the wall of the ruined house. OK, there are more than just a few tense moments.<br/><br/>There were times when all I wanted to do was shout at them for being so stupid. Heather found Joshua's nose, teeth, and eyes, and yet she still chased after his voice! And then there was when herself and Mike found the house, how could they have let themselves get separated? If that was me I would have been clinging to him for dear life!<br/><br/>The final few minutes are a blur, the cameras are shaky and the images unclear. When she runs into the basement It's unreal! When the film was over the whole audience just sat there, waiting. One person exclaimed What? It can't be over!', while others sighed in relief. Everyone was waiting for more. What a brilliant way to end a film! It leaves you free to draw your own conclusions, which is scarier that any special effects or gory images could ever be. The things 5 of us came up with in the car home were just chilling, and I'm not the type of person who is easily disturbed.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. I can see how American audiences believed it was true. When they try and leave the forest and end up walking in a circle Heather's  words cut through me like a spear: It's not the same log. It's not the same log. It's not the same log It's the same log It's the same log.' How could someone act out that fear? But what I think affected most people was the scene when Heather has the camera on herself and she's apologising for causing their deaths: It's all my fault.' Everyone one I spoke to could not help but stare at her tears.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend that this film should be watched in company, just so you have someone to walk home with! Especially if you have an overactive imagination. Or any imagination at all! It's by far the best film out at the moment, and one of the best I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot).<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project': don't believe what other people have said about it - see it for yourself."

","I went to see The Blair Witch Project with my girlfriend and my uncle two days ago.  After reading all the hype and watching The Curse Of The Blair Witch on SkyOne I thought it would be a great horror film.<br/><br/>After leaving the cinema we thought it was ""pretty good"".  It had a unique way of putting you in the film and believing you were there. For a horror film there's nothing really happening in it, except for getting lost in the forrest. It wasn't until that night and the next day that I kept thinking about it and realised just how scary it was (it's not easy for me to get scared at anything - my favourites are horror).  I realized just how far their minds had gone (Mike sitting on the ground rocking back and forward was a bit eerie). It was done very well in the fact that there is no real entity you can see and fight against - there's no big monster or lunatic with a knife to be scared of - it's just psychological horror.<br/><br/>I'm was more scared of the film yesterday than I was just after I watched it.

","What people told me about BWP (before I went to see it) fell into four categories, namely:- <br/><br/>(i) [competitive chili eater type] ""I wasn't scared in the slightest""<br/><br/>(ii) [sensitive/never seen a horror film] ""I was REALLY scared""<br/><br/>(iii) [postmodern] ""less is more, pass the homous.....""; or . . . . . .  <br/><br/>(iv)  [jaded] ""it didn't live up to all the hype""<br/><br/>I got the hype first from advance news of how it was going down in the states and then as the publicity machine clicked into effect on this side of the pond.  I bet this spoilt the fun for a lot of the UK audience, as we had probably heard the entire plot several times before the thing got in front of our eyeballs.<br/><br/>I couldn't work out what to think about BWP when I came out of the cinema. But by random TV scheduling I saw ""Sleepers"" the following day, a highish budget ""quality"" Hollywood film dealing with serious issues (child abuse, revenge killing etc) and with the likes of De Niro and D.Hoffman in it.  It dawned on me then that the experience of watching BWP was hardly linked at all with that of going to see a production like ""Sleepers"" or anything else released for mass markets.  BWP is basically a home video.  It almost delights in using the cheapest backdrop and plots ( - a wood - a killer! - Troma's favorites!!) and no SFX worth mentioning. <br/><br/>The fact is that BWP would certainly be worse or even pointless if these factors weren't present.  The whole thing is about believability, and for that reason the film must be in the roughcut shape it is in or it couldn't be mistaken for a home video, which is the intention.  Shame then that the thing still cost the same to watch as a proper film, which is about $14US here in London.<br/><br/>Secondly, BWP (like ""Sleepers"", incidentally) largely left the serious violence as intimated rather than explicit. Hitchcock laughed off complaints about ""Psycho"" being too violent/scary when it came out by saying that the film as it progressed got less and less explicit and towards the end he was showing practically nothing on screen, but that the audience found that the most frightening.  <br/><br/>With BWP, Hitchcock's point is extrapolated to the point where nigh-on nothing is shown at all.  For me, either the film or my imagination was not quite up to it, and I was not convinced. But it's a pretty good attempt.<br/><br/>Maybe it will be better on TV as there's nothing much about the cinema format which adds to the chill factor in this one, except being in a big dark room. In fact, watching pixels on a cinema screen is quite distracting for me. I think a dark night at home with this could prove that the home video format is the proper environment for it to work properly."

Had this film come thru on the promise it showed in the documentary (and even the web site!) it would have been a good film but it falls short in so many ways that I wont start listing for fear of putting off the casual reader.<br/><br/>While I don't mind never seeing the BW, I do think they could have done a better job of explaining the curse in the movie.  If I had not seen the documentary, I would have given this film a 1 vs the 2 I did rate it.

It taps into our primordial fears (getting lost, the dark, distant noises, inexplicable symbolism) and exploits them out the ying-yang.  <br/><br/>It is to the film's advantage that it was shot on camcorders; the constantly moving lens gives the film an urgent, breathless feel that makes it seem as if, yes, this is all actually taking place as we see it.

","This may be a spoiler, but-- While this film has been compared numerous times (and rightly so) to Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, why has nobody remarked on the fact that the so-called ""original"" and ""chilling"" final five minutes are swiped shot for shot from the French film Man Bites Dog - a film which also, oddly enough, passed itself off as a zero-budget cinema verite horror film told entirely from the point of view of amateur documentarians? While Blair Witch isn't bad, it's just not terribly scary; it spends so much time appropriating elements from other, stronger films and trying to pass them off as fact that it becomes increasingly clear that the filmmakers had no idea what they were trying to ""suggest.""  In films like The Haunting and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, your imagination can fill in the blanks and scare you because you can conjure up what's behind the door, what's lurking in the trees, etc.  In Blair Witch, the menace is so inconsistent and poorly drawn that it just becomes ultimately frustrating.  It's not important that you find out what happens to the kids, but shouldn't there at least be some rationale behind it?  The ""creepy"" final image smacks more of a script that painted itself into a corner than some kind of artistic ambiguous statement. Too bad -- the film does have some powerful atmosphere and occasionally exploits everyone's fears of the dark quite well, but this is hardly a revolutionary or groundbreaking film.

"Evan-29","Null","0","1","1 November 1999"," The best horror film of the '90s, but not for everyone
","First off, this film is NOT for everyone. Do you feel like you need to see something to be scared of it? Do you have no imagination? Then don't even bother. Blair Witch is...I don't want to call it a ""thinking man's"" horror film, as it doesn't raise any philosophical questions (though it will keep people talking for a while) but it is definitely more for people who have a strong imagination. No gore, no makeup, no boogie monster, and no shocks...just pure unadulterated terror.<br/><br/>I won't even bother with the plot, since everyone already knows it. The 2 merits of the film is in the style: everything is very gritty, with no music and nothing that ever strikes one as fake. For example, take the scene where Heather opens up the bundle of sticks (don't worry, I won't reveal what's inside!). In a typical horror film, she would let out a long scream and you would hear ""dun dun dun"" on the soundtrack. Here, it all seems so real you can't help but feel the same terror and helplessness as she.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting is amazing. This is Method acting taken to the extreme...nobody gets ""everyone I know is dead but I'm going to investigate that strange noise anyway"" scared. No, they get ""I'm so terrified I can't even move or stop crying"" scared. Like a real person. And they aren't your typical seemingly retarded teenagers who can't seem to walk into a room without tripping, either. You get to know them, and the first half of the film is even very funny, as you get to hear them chatting and quipping away, oblivious to what will happen. I can't wait to see these three in other roles!<br/><br/>All in all, this is a must-see film for everyone, though not everyone will like it. Personally, I love it. I should also mention that it's MUCH scarier in retrospect than in the theater. The final scene STILL hasn't left my mind."

","I found this film to be one of the most original and powerful I've seen recently. It is based on a once-in-lifetime idea. The story is told in a totally subjective, POV manner, more so than any film I know. I can understand why many people disliked it. It made no concessions to the expectations of mainstream filmgoers, or even of horror film fans. And once the ""mythic"" groundwork was laid, plot points tended to be made subtly, and with ""don't blink"" speed. Anyone used to being ""spoon-fed"" plot and character would likely miss much. The characters' realization of their situation and increasing terror were revealed gradually and very naturalistically, which may have made the film seem slow to some. It is, in its way, a great film, and a greater horror film, but I cannot see how it can be followed up at all effectively.  It would do better to remain unique. A sequel would surely seem contrived and redundant, and a different film using same or similar technique would merely seem derivative."

All in all, I was very scared by this movie and those who didn't like it didn't give it a fair chance. It's all about our deepest fears, and the parts where it was just black and we hear sounds was the scariest. People were really unfair to this film. It's a nice break from all these ""Scream"" and ""Poltrigist"" movies.

","When Blair Witch was released in Europe, it was inevitable to go to see it with a high level of curiosity and expectations, given all the rave reviews and incredible box office numbers it got in the States. Unfortunately, one of the things we were hearing about it was not correct: that it was a horror movie.<br/><br/>Because I don't think it is, or at least that it doesn't respond to the perceived conventions of that genre. Blair Witch IS a superb exercise of growing tension, suspense and anguish, with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere which gradually grips you and drags you into the nightmare that these three kids, normal people like you and me, suddenly find themselves in. You know as little as they do, and you don't need any more, because your imagination does the rest. And your perception of the film gets even better the more you think and reflect upon what you have seen. I was entirely satisfied. But this is undoubtedly an arthouse film, and it seems to me that many people had misguidedly gone to see it expecting a slick, popcorn-friendly, Kevin-Williamsonish scare-fest with lots of surprise shocks and a blood-drenched grand finale. Which it certainly is not. Therefore, I can understand why so many complain about it having disappointed them so much.<br/><br/>For me, only one thing could have made it better: having been able to see it without knowing it was fake, like the first people who saw it in the States did. When I came out of the cinema, a couple of ladies behind me, who had somehow managed to avoid all the hype and press coverage, were asking with worried faces ""...but did they ever find the bodies?"". And I envied them deeply."

","Ok, time to add my 2 cents about the ""Blair witch project phenomena"" ... and I have to say that I reallllllly loved this movie ... This was indeed an original film with lots of scary moments that are quite effective even if nothing *really* scary is ever shown on screen (Use your imagination folks... geesh !)<br/><br/>I understand how some people (most people ??) would dislike it though ... harsh language, minimal plot, shaky camera ... etc. etc.  But for me all those elements are waht make it really intriguing and believable.<br/><br/>People in this movie talk as ordinary people ... not like they are reciting lines of dialogues from a script written by someone else.  The plot is really not so important either as the documentary aspect of the project is only a way to get those 3 in the woods and show what happened to them in a realistic way, without some phony twists and turns ... and the shaky camera aspect is the icing on the cake ... making it look even more ""real"" ...<br/><br/>
The acting is top notch, especially by Heather in the lead ... some really good scene especially the one where she ""apologizes"" to her mother and the mothers of her friends ... extreme close up of her face in the middle of the night, brilliant !<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that you either love or hate and I am certainly in the 1st category.  It is also a movie that would appeal more to people who see a lot of movies I think ... People who watch a movie per month will probably hate it ... but if you have a little more ""experience"" it will probably be a better experience.<br/><br/>Some really chilling scenes and tension building up all the time make this movie one of the scariest of all times, if you are willing to ""think"" a little of course because it is not really what you see on screen that is frightening .. it is what you imagine seeing the situation those people are in.<br/><br/>4.5/5"

","Everyone you talk will say, oh, it wasn't scary, it was hokey. Oh, I wasn't frightened for a minute. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. And critics are saying this film was overhyped? I don't think so. Not since ""Event Horizon"" (a film that was much scarier than anyone said it was) have I ever been so frozen with terror. I just sat down in the theater and let the suspense build up to a point where I couldn't move any longer. This was an excellent film. It might not have been as scary as the billing suggested, but that doesn't mean it wasn't scary as hell. ""The Blair Witch Project"" chronicles the journey of three student filmmakers who venture into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while trying to film a documentary about a witch supposedly living in the hills who would take children into her house to draw blood from them. Even though the filmmakers never have a direct encounter with the witch, what happens to them is just as bad. They begin to fight, lose their food, direction, and find themselves fighting for their lives while in the meantime they're being stalked by someone they don't even know is watching them. As I've said before, in my opinion anyway, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an excrutiatingly terrifying film. Many people will have their own opinions, and I don't intend on challenging that, but if you ask me, it was excellent. The camerawork was crude but still had some incredible shots, the editing was masterful, the direction was also great, but what really takes the viewer are the performances of the three unknown actors, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams. Slowly they take their characters from happy, to goofy, to normal, to anger, sadness, and then finally terror. They won't get nominated for any Oscars, but they were still great. I give ""The Blair Witch Project"" 5 stars on a five star scale."

","Oh dear.  What a calamity.  This movie had so much promise, so much potential greatness - so what happened?  Why did this excellent on paper movie, not do the business on film?<br/><br/>I know exactly why - a weak script, average performances and too much pre-release hype.  To go into more detail..<br/><br/>Before I begin, the movies as most people clearly know is far from original - we have seen this done before and far better in Cannibal Holocaust, so we are not seeing anything new, irrespective of what Hollywood will tell us.<br/><br/>
OK, the initial premise is good - it makes you want to see it, and to see how the future of these guys unfolds.  However, the main problem lies within - you never feel as if you are with these people.  At times, you feel yourself rooting for the Blair Witch.  I could have produced very similar results if I took 2 friends camping ANYWHERE in England, left a Hi-8 camera running throughout.  There was a severe lack of substance in this movie - although you may think that a lot happened as you leave the aisles, nothing really did.<br/><br/>There were some good moments in this, and as a whole, I was intrigued to see how things would unfold - at several points, I found it difficult to take my eyes off the screen.  However, the other 75 minutes of this movie left the viewer wanting, and delivered nothing.  As we know, this is an amateur production - myself being an amateur film-maker, I spent a lot of the time figuring out how shots were produced - but this also was it's major downfall.  Scenes of argument and confrontation, always seemed 2 seconds away from total hilarity, as if the actors were ready to roll around the floor laughing.  Not a good sign.<br/><br/>So to sum up - Blair Witch is a horror movie?  sadly, no.  Never will be - not in this lifetime."

I'll skip all that and go straight to the review. This movie has scary moments, unfortunatly they were only in the last twenty minutes or so. Does the rest of the movie keep your interest? Yes and no. This movie has a ""real"" aspect to it, the problem is that real life is mundane. Most people go to films to escape reality, and when they are faced with mundane reality (people looking at twigs and going ""boo!"", it can get dull for some. I, however, found it interesting in a ""Real World"" voyer kind of way. Then when the characters do things that would never, ever happen in real-life (i.e. what happens to the map). That just wrenches you out of the story and completely kills your suspension of disbelief, you realize that you've been watching a movie for the last 45 minutes and nothing at all has happened. <br/><br/>The bottom line is, this movie was hyped...bad. Nothing could live up to the expectations people had. The only thing that could possibly save this movie for people just now seeing it, is if you could somehow forget the past few months of commercials, emails, and testimonials; and just watch an interesting little experiment from a couple of young, talented filmakers."

Still, advertisers make a damn good living from making a film seem ten times better than it really is.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the fact that when I saw it, I was sharing the experience with several hundred other popcorn-swilling punters in a huge state-of-the-art cinema where you go out expecting to have entertainment handed to you on a plate. Most of the people there weren't phased at all. I say most however; three of my friends were completely messed up by it. Maybe I missed something.<br/><br/>I can't help thinking how much more I would have enjoyed it if I had watched it in one of the subterranean screens of the arthouse just down the road. The audience would have been smaller, more subdued and more importantly wouldn't leave their mobile phones turned on. There, after all, is where the film deserved to be because it has bucketloads of artistic merit as opposed to mass appeal. The extensive use of method acting and improvisation really shines in places and if viewed under the right atmosphere, is exceptionally effective.<br/><br/>This film doesn't however have the makings of a true classic. Any box office figures that point to the contrary can be put down to media hype. When you look at it, bits of the film don't gel and the audience doesn't really get a chance to truly connect with most of the characters.<br/><br/>On the other hand what I like most about this film is that it shows that gritty realism with the absence of glamorous actors, makeup, special effects and post production can work extremely well. I just hope and pray that more filmmakers pick up on this in the future because the contrary has been getting out of hand in recent years."

Once I found myself believing what I was watching, I entered into the atmosphere, and this is what I found: morbidity, just that.

The DVD package is excellent - the movie, director's commentary, various trailers, BW myth, TV documentary. The user interface is also well done (very spooky). BUT... nothing really happens. That may have been OK when no-one knew anything about it but now that some of the story has leaked out (like the fact that it was the producers who spooked the campers) then something was lost. You couldn't help think ""I know who put that stuff there"". So it's a victim of its own success.

The fact that they seem to be the characters they are playing and are largely unknown actors only heightens the horror.<br/><br/>The jerky motion of the camera gives an authentic feel to an amateur documentary and reportedly left many viewers, including this one, with a feeling of nausea at the film's end.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project clearly demonstrates that the modestly budgeted independent film is alive and well. We'll now probably have to endure many big studio clones of this one that are sure to pop up in the next year.<br/><br/>Don't miss this one, it's an original and a one of a kind."
"BB-15","5","0","1","31 October 1999"," Once It Gets Going, a Powerful Exploration of Fear
","It is amazing when I see an interesting movie like Blair Witch that cost under 50 thousand dollars to make. I say interesting rather than rave about it because there is about half of a very good movie here but the rest I was less impressed with.<br/><br/>First the acting in Blair Witch is top notch, absolutely believable. I recently saw Clerks, another successful ultra cheap feature, where some of the characters weren't even acting. Instead they were simply being their strange selves. But Clerks from start to finish has something that Blair Witch does not. It is tightly paced while Blair Witch rambles for the first half hour. It is too slow and some of the townspeople are given too much air time. Now I understand this is supposed to be some quasi student documentary but it does not have to be dull. <br/><br/>Once the actors get into the woods, the film begins to hit its stride. My only complaint about the second half hour is the lengthy time spent on reactions to piles of rocks and tied together sticks. The editing here needed to be more crisp. On a positive note the tension between the actors begins to build in a very believable way.<br/><br/>The last third of Blair Witch was terrific. The actors slipping into madness, the running into the night is electric and the incredible speech in the tent by Heather Donahue is great. The final crazed moments in the house have a mind bending David Lynch feel, very disturbing. <br/><br/>
Few movies that I have seen are as up and down as Blair Witch. Considering that this is a first film and the limited budget this is understandable. But while the beginning is slow, the wait was worth it. Few films explore the depth of fear as well as Blair Witch."
"The Fuzz","Null","0","1","30 October 1999"," Wimp in ""too scared to visit the lavatory"" shock.
","Like many people have said, the film is just too long: 45 - 60 minutes would've been just fine.  Plus, again like many people have said, the sheer amount of hype and comment detracts from the film, preparing you too well for what would otherwise have been a deeply unsettling experience. Nevertheless, it spooked me, and not just for the rest of the night, but into the bright sunny morning that followed.  Embarrassing to admit, but I didn't want to leave my room, except when nature was calling too loudly to ignore!<br/><br/>Is it only me that detects the influence of MR James on the story?  As with James, we learn of the horrors from 'found' material: in James's stories it's usually diaries, or newspaper reports, or letters, or an overheard conversation, arranged and presented by a disinterested narrator; here, of course, it's the tapes and negatives unearthed long after the fact, the 'narrator' almost invisible except for the opening crawl (and for the fact that someone had to decide how the footage would be presented).  I'm not sure why this technique is so effective, unless it is simply the veneer of presenting facts, rather than creating a story.  The more obvious Jamesian influence is in leaving the precise nature of the horrors unexplained, but giving just enough information to leave you in no doubt that whatever is behind the phenomena is very nasty indeed.  Check out any James collection to see what I mean; 'A School Story', 'Count Magnus' and 'The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral' are perhaps the most typical examples.<br/><br/>But do you want scary?  I mean REALLY scary?  Oh, I can give you scary.<br/><br/>A couple of days after seeing the film, a friend of mine was talking to colleagues about it.  A lady in her twenties had also been to see it, with a group of friends.<br/><br/>""Did you think it was scary?"" asked my friend.<br/><br/>""Oh yes,"" she replied, ""it was terrifying.  I don't know how they got away with it.""<br/><br/>""Got away with what?""<br/><br/>""Showing those poor people dying like that""<br/><br/>""You're joking.""<br/><br/>""And the dead children, too.  They shouldn't have had the dead children on there.  I don't like that.""<br/><br/>""Tell me you're joking.""<br/><br/>""What do you mean?""<br/><br/>""You didn't really think it was real, do you?""<br/><br/>""Oh, it was.""<br/><br/>""It was not!""<br/><br/>""Yes it was.

It is a movie that is best seen without listening to all the hype thats going on, and best watched alone or with your partner.<br/><br/>The concept is simple, think Cannibal Holocaust, which the film makers admit as being inspirational. 3 college film makers enter a forest in Burkittsville to explain the legend of the Blair Witch. Legend has it that the forest is haunted and many children disappeared a century or 2 earlier.<br/><br/>When in the forest, they get lost, how original. They are haunted, but the question is.... by what? Is it a ghost or is it some lunatic, theres a nice reference to Deliverance by one of the characters. What is certain is they don't make it out of the forest, as you are told from the beginning.<br/><br/>What you are actually watching is the hours and hours of footage they managed to shoot which was found after they went missing, and edited down to 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Thats the original bit, along with the fact that you are watching raw footage of what actually happened in real life. The actors were given little food and were told to go into the forest for a week, camping, no civilisation for the entire shoot. Each actor only had their lines given to them, no one knew how the others were going to respond. Thats scary enough, without the directors firing gunshots at 3 in the morning and making weird stick things to freak them out.<br/><br/>By the end of the shoot the actors aren't just acting, its true emotion, they really are stressed out, they really are cold, and they really do want to get out of the damn forest.<br/><br/>So sit back in the dark, switch the lights off and be scared."

","I saw it the day it opened, to minimize the effect of heightned expectations.  So my expectations were minimal.  It blew.  From the very beginning there is no attempt to get the audience to empathize with the characters.  They could not have been more unlikeable.  They were afraid of a pile of rocks?  Not likely.  As soon as that happened, I lost any ability to relate to the character's sense of fear.  Everything else that happened was random and unclear.  You could never quite grasp what exactly they thought they were running from.  Whatever sounds they heard, I certainly didn't hear. And when a character does dissappear, there sense of fear doesn't seem to increase. Interesting because I think that would be pretty scary. It was random, and nonsensical. I'm sorry if you think I am warped by Hollywood's idea of a scary movie. But there is nothing inherently scary about bad camera work and bad dialouge. The scariest thing about this movie is the thought that similar movies are likely to be massed produced due to the unfathomable box office success of this piece. Skip it."
"Ace-38","Null","0","1","25 October 1999"," Absolutely terrifying
","I have intentionally waited to write my review for this movie.  I saw it shortly after its release and wanted to wait for the initial hysteria to die down.  I have now seen it twice at the theater and bought it on video Thursday.  This is truly the most terrifying experience I have ever had.<br/><br/>The plotline (borrowing from the tagline here) is three student filmmakers disappear in the woods in Maryland, and a year later their footage is found. A young film student (Heather Donohue) hires two guys (Mike Williams and Josh Leonard) to accompany her into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a local legend:  The Blair Witch.   The three soon find themselves lost in the woods, with no foreseeable way out, no matter where or how far they go.  All the while, an unseen force stalks their every move.<br/><br/>This movie clearly plays on all our most primal fears.  Where am I?, How am I gonna get out of here?, and mostly..what the hell was that noise?  It teases your emotions and tweaks your nerves to the point that you feel relief when the credits roll.<br/><br/>Heather Donohue is a major star in waiting.  Her ""portrayal"" of a young woman paralyzed by fear (remember folks, they only had a rough outline of the script, everything that happened was as much a surprise to them as it was to us) is chilling<br/><br/>Michael Williams and Josh Leonard are also wonderful in their ""roles"". Josh, in my opinion, is the most scared of the three.  He is the first to fall apart and shows his emotions easily.  Michael Williams is the one who tries, despite all odds, to keep the group together in an attempt to escape not only the woods, but whatever is hunting them.  These two young men have a wonderful acting career ahead of them, and it will be nice to watch them grow in the future.<br/><br/>One novel thing about this movie is the fact that, in my opinion, it works better on the small screen than the big one.  The (mainly) videotape footage frames well on your TV, and somehow adds to the terror.  If you buy the tape or DVD, you can skip the ""newly discovered footage"".  It feels very tacked on, and is clearly shot on 35mm film.  Probably footage scripted and shot especially for the home release.<br/><br/>Unlike modern horror films (Scream, Urban Legend),""The Blair Witch Project"" packs a punch whether its your first viewing or your 10,000th.  This movie grabs you by the teeth and pulls you into the depths of its insanity.  As an old horror veteran, I have to rank this one among the greats, such as ""Psycho"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Halloween"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".<br/><br/>4 out of 4"

The plot line was very well developed at the beginning of the movie and was able to sustain itself for the initial foray of Heather, Mike and Josh in the woods.  However, the mid section with everyone running around in the woods became extremely tedious and even annoying at time with their ineptitude.

While it is refreshing to see a horror movie that's more about true fear than gore, violence and sex, it's been done before, and much, MUCH better. Granted, the film 'Deliverance' did provide it's share of gore and sex (both to INCREDIBLY disturbing effect), it's shear 'it could happen to me' factor was far higher and it stuck with me a lot longer than this matinee, popcorn-movie version did.<br/><br/>I applaud the ability to market such a low-end product as edgy and surreal, but seems more work could have been done to flush it out into a truly terrifying tale.

The naive, smart ass kids who encounter their worst fears is also borrowed from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, another movie that came to mind while watching this (especially that ending).  The actors were pretty good, for once the nonstop usage of the ""F"" word seemed appropriate (kids scared out of their gourds would probably talk like this).

I felt like at times I was in the movie due to the fact that the actors held the cameras and this gives the film a certain flavor of credibility.  Rarely do horror films scare me, but this one did in certain scenes due to the fact that the kids acted in such a way that I would have, and this allowed me to get sucked in to the building tensions and terror-induced thinking schemes.  Truly this is a fabulous way to shoot a film if you like candid typed situations that lend an air of uncertainty. As I said before though, this film will not entertain everyone.  It comes up short as a horror film due to the fact that the storyline is somewhat vague. This brings me to the point I made earlier:  This film is not for those who like to be spoon fed the plot, storyline, or viewpoints of the director. This movie is slickly handled and well ahead of it's time."

","The Blair Witch Project scared me as only one movie before, that being The Exorcist. TBWP is not a gruesome, horrid, gore-fest as there is maybe one scene is featuring blood. All the terrors and monsters in TBWP are those that lie within ones own mind. As Heather, Mike and Josh become more and more desperately lost in the Maryland woods, you begin to feel them closing in around the heroes and yourself. The film is so immersive that you too feel like a part of the film crew that has become lost. You feel anger towards Josh, worried about Mike, and sorry for Heather. When you hear Heather's final confession, it's as though one of your own children or friends are saying goodbye from beyond the grave. The scariest thing is that these three actors never had a script, just a vague outline of the film and the producers following them and tormenting them throughout the process of filming. That means that all reactions onscreen are real and not portrayals. TBWP is not a horror film, but a serious mind screw as it dives not only into the what is out there formula horror but, the what the hell is going on in your mind formula of psychological thrillers."

","Imagine yourself and two other of your close friends, go into an easily looking woods to get out of, but get lost. Now, you are stuck in the Blair Witch Project, where you, the viewer are right up close with the people filming. At night, you hear noises of your friend screaming in the woods, and your tent starts to shake, and before you saw these sticks that looked like people hanging from trees, and you also are running for your life. Viewer beware, this is what happens in the Blair Witch Project.<br/><br/>But don't believe it is real. You have to look up for some background information on this hit movie. When I went to see it, I thought it was real, but how could it be when Heather Donahue was on the Tonight Show in mid 99. The movie was said to be filmed in 1994, which is a lie. But this movie does drag just a little when Josh and Heather start to fight over the camera. The ACTING is so life like and superb. I really liked this movie. The ending doesn't really symbolize anything, nor does it make any sense. But I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Let me just say it takes place in an old cabin/house when Heather and her friend hears Josh screaming. The end was just plain dumb."

","(Forgive any spelling mistake I made. I am a Chinese and my English is not that good) Let me start off by saying that this is a great movie. It is scary and really gives you something to think about the next time you go camping. The good thing about this movie is the feeling of uneasy stays with you, much like after watching Jaws you will think twice about swimming at the sea. I really really loves it.<br/><br/>However, there are times when this movie make no sense. While the way the movie is made and the acting really makes it looks like a ""Real Time, Real Life"" feel, the Heather do a lot of things that you wouldn't do if you are in that situation.  For example, after Heather opened the ""Package"" and we later saw her filming herself while washing her hand!! While you panicked and want to wash away the blood as soon as you can, you will never think about filming! The scene will make more sense if it was Mike who is filming Heather and ask what SHE is doing.  I understand they want to get back to the car so they won't follow the steam (which they should), however since the tent isn't much of a protection anyway why don't they climb a tree and stay there for a night? It is not a great idea but it least you will see if someone go near you and left a surpise at your door step (or tent step, whatever). Also, at the last part. While you are going into a house and try to save your friend, do you really have time to hold a camera to shoot a film? Anyone who had used a camera knows that it is very hard to search for anything if you are shooting.If turning on a camera is just for using the light, shouldn't it be held on the hand like a tourch, instead of a shooting position? I think the last scene will be better it there is only on cam. shooting.<br/><br/>If you could ingor what YOU would do in their situation, the movie is actually very good. I say go watch it!!"

","A good premise -- finding video and film left behind by three folks who disappeared in a dense forest -- and generally good acting -- all three main characters and those in supporting roles were fine.  However, the film is very repetitive, which makes it seem much longer than it really is.  (A plot summary would take about ten sentences, at most.)  In addition, somehow the ""villain"" never seemed real.  And, PLEASE, don't tell me that someone would have prepared for such an outing (as our heroine supposedly did with her backpacker's guide) and not know that if you get lost and come upon a stream, you simply follow it downstream until you find a home, town, or the shore of a large body of water, any of which allow you to quickly find others."

I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.<br/><br/>3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every day."

","Watching this movie is being part of a cultural phenomenom. The marketing created so much expectation that you just can't miss this great film. Making people think it was a real story was the best campaign they could have created. <br/><br/>You already know what it's about: 3 kids get lost in the woods while shooting a documentary on the Blair Witch legend. And you know that since the budget was so limited, you can't expect to see a computer animated witch.<br/><br/>But the film does deliver an eerie atmosphere. You can easily relate to this characters, just by remembering when you've been in the woods, or heard strange noises coming from the dark. And if you add the story of a haunting, you can feel the despair and fear of this three people.<br/><br/>Many people have criticized the camera work, saying it's confusing and dark. And that's exactly what it's supposed to be. You're looking at the work of Heather, Josh and Mike, not a professional Discovery Channel documentary.<br/><br/>The most important thing here is the psychological development of the characters. The way they react to the situation, the way they confront each other and start losing their sanity. The acting was amazing, specially when Heather asks for forgiveness.<br/><br/>What would I change? Maybe the sound effects should be clearer, specially the first night they get haunted. It was hard to recognize the noises they were talking about. And maybe we should have seen a light, a mist, a glowing figure in the distance. Not an eye popping special effect, just a little touch of visual terror.<br/><br/>But you can't miss The Blair Witch Project. Whether you like it or not, I'm sure we'll still be talking about it in the years to come. It'll be a trendsetter."

","Quite a few people have already expressed their opinions about this film that I don't want to repeat. Let's not fool ourselves, by thinking that this is the best horror film since the ""Exorcist"". The whole film is based on the premise that it is supposed to be real. By taking this first step in your imagination, then you can begin to appreciate it. Most of the horror comes from our own imagination, hardly anything is spoon fed (the slasher movies comes to mind which are so graphic in detail, it leaves little to the imagination). You'll have to put the old grey matter in to first gear to try and step into the character's shoes. <br/><br/>The film, if nothing else, is realistic. We see the three characters spiralling deeper and deeper into breakdown and insanity. Their ability to think logically is turned upside down as they get more and more lost in the woods. Strange sounds at night, wierd symbolic objects in the morning doesn't help their sanity much either. <br/><br/>The ending is abrupt, and an anti-climax for sure. But the horror of the film doesn't start until you go home and think about the film. The more you go over the film in your head, the more horrifying it is, as if it was a true story.<br/><br/>There will be people who won't like it, but the film is a docu-horror film which has succeeded where many before has failed."
"tooms-5","Null","0","1","13 October 1999"," great at making you scared
","Firstly to the sceptics... If you have ever gone hiking in the woods and been lost with a bunch of mates no older than 20 you would completely understand everything that goes on in this film. Group dynamics fall apart and the so-called leader, leads the group astray. Fortunately most of these events turn out good however something else is at work in this film.<br/><br/>Whilst I have an objection to complete improvisation in a film it has worked very well for this one. The authenticity of what happens is frighteningly chilling. People our age swear  worse than those in that film. There is always an annoying ""chick"" you drives people insane over their petty little causes. The characters were not written leaving room for faults and inconsistencies we see in everyday cinema. But rather they were constructed by people who most likely were those characters in real life. Good acting is not acting at all.<br/><br/>Being in the army I know what it is like to be up at night in the cold because you heard noises (only in training). Most of the time it is gunshots but not all the time. Your cold, you wanna sleep and you are scared simply because it is night (and if it were real you'd probably be dead). Hence those night scenes, the darkness, the cold, and the noises really hit home and play on the primal fear of the dark and the unknown. Unlike every other ""scary"" film out now, this one leaves it all up to your imagination, the most powerful tool! You can think of so much more than you can see and that scares people.<br/><br/>My recomendation is experience the film in a dark place with good sound and think of those times you got scared as a kid or a teenager in the night. Then you may understand what the people in the film are going through. And even though it is not real, it is still a landmark achievement in making you scared! not just of the film, but every time that light goes out and the cold air fills the place!"

"Fred-146","9","0","1","12 October 1999"," A Brilliant, Original, Classic Horror Film
","I just saw Blair Witch Project for the second time the other night and I was very surprised that the film had nearly the same effect on me as it did the first time I saw it. This is one of the most brilliant horror films I have ever seen!<br/><br/>For those of you this movie is BAD, I think your reasons are unjustified. I'm going to list the many reasons why people thought this movie was bad.<br/><br/>1. It was a home made movie-----The whole premise of this movie was to show the footage of three filmmakers who went into the woods and disappeared. The ads clearly said that this was ""their"" footage? What were you all expected. A glossy, high budget, special effects driven film, with lots of scary music and gore? Come on, these were film students!! The film remain true to that premise and did not deviate from it in any way. This was to look like a home video, and that made the film seem all the more real, therefore, much more effective.<br/><br/>2. Those kids were so stupid....Oh, as opposed to those brilliant teenagers we see in movies like Friday the 13th, I Know What You Did..., and countless other slasher films? Give me a break!!! Heather, Josh, and Mike were about as naiive as you and I, but they certainly were not stupid!! Many said they should have carried a cell phone with them. How many people in 1994 had cell phones compared to how common it is today for people to have one? Some said they should have been better prepared for camping. Hello! If any of you who said that had an ATTENTION SPAN would have learned that Heather is the type of person who goes camping and is familiar with navigating her way through the woods. Most importantly, these kids would have found their way out of the woods if they were not scared out their minds!! They were researching a legend, that they apparently believed was not true. Nothing these kinds ever did made me want to shout ""STUPID! STUPID!"" at them. I however have wanted to do that to many of the characters in several films. Plus, the characters in most slasher films have a choice to what danger they put themselves in. They know a killer is on the loose. In Blair Witch, the kids were lost in the woods before they realized something unexpected was hunting them down.<br/><br/>3. The acting was TERRIBLE!...There were many people who saw this film and thought it was real. Oh, but how could that happen if the acting was so bad? They should have known by that it was all fake, right? I think many of you have confused bad acting with ""raw acting"". The acting in this film wasn't meant to be dramatic, otherwise the film wouldn't have worked. The fact that the acting was so raw, made the film all the more realistic.<br/><br/>4. Nothing ever happens in the movie, it's so boring....Apparently you who say this do not know how to use your imagination. Plenty happens in this film. Imagine how you would react if you heard strange noises in the form of laughing in the woods, or if someone was attacking your tent, or if you then found and area of the woods with all these occultic symbols, or if you heard your friend screaming in the woods and you were unable to help him, and then find parts of his body wrapped in his clothing...Many of these things gave me the chills becuase I was able to put myself in their shoes.<br/><br/>5. They should run for their lives....What in the world do you think they were doing the whole movie?? They were walking, and running, and running, and going in circles and losing their mind. If you knew what it feels like to be lost, you'd understand that panic ensues and thinking your way out of a situation becomes harder and harder. And when they heard Josh's voice in the house I wasn't surprised they went in after him because that is something I would do in such a desperate situation.<br/><br/>I guess many of you still need to the graphic violence and gore for a movie to entertain you and simply can't use your imaginations. Go on and continue to be entertained by the brainless horror films like Friday the 13th. I guess the Blair Witch Project is just way out of your league.<br/><br/>This was one of the most original films of the decade and was so worthy of the hype. Many films used hype like TBWP. ""Psycho"" comes to mind as Hitchcock stated that NO ONE would be admitted after the beginning of the film. This sparked everyone's curioisity thinking that something happens at the beginning. There's nothing wrong with this as long as the film lives up to that hype. Psycho and Blair Witch both did that.<br/><br/>Face it, Blair Witch Project will go down in movie history as one of the greatest horror films ever made along with Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs, Seven, and Scream. All of these films redefined the horror genre and expounded the limits of what horror films could do at that time."

","it's not only a movie or an unexpectedly generated moneymaking wonder but a FULL-STOP for the 20th century cinematography as well. Shaping of the cinema as the 7 art is cruised a long road until now. Horror films evaluated from Mr.Karloff to Mr.Craven. Poltergeist is a milestone at early 1980s by opening a new era it was a pioneer. With Blair Witch Project we've noticed the naivete and innocence of personally generated fears with instincts alone. That's why we can name this a full-stop with an expectancy of unlimited human genius and creativity without hi-tech tricks but mind (which we can use the 20% power of that engine). A simple way following the destiny with those guys who were (maybe far from realism and reasonability but leave as it is) lost in forest. A trivia of victim and victimization. There is no need to critic the scenario: as we've meet the improvisations of the players are perfect. Film accelerate itself good enough to accompany the audience smoothly together. But I've heard some of them: Wow it's good, but i felt that the film wasn't over it's just started. Finally, by the help of Blair Witch Project, we've noticed there exists a genre or cult: INDEPENDENT MOVIE. It really seemed as a graduation project of postgraduate students. By this well woven harmony and loop they have remained a forgotten taste from the distant shelves of pure genius and simplicity.

There were a few frightening scenes, although the ""stick-and-rope"" people was not one of them.  I found the rock piles captivating as they were slightly druidic as was the scene where Heather discovers Josh's clothing wrapped around something grotesque and bloody. The story-line was great, and the ending captivating, but all of the bickering between the actors about the map, getting lost, and needing a cigarette, ( embellished with all of that profanity I mentioned), took away most of the horror the film was meant to convey.  The best thing about the film was the dialog that followed after the return home.  My twenty-something sons actually spent time discussing something other than baseball standings and Tekken 2, and that was refreshing.  I spent $7.50 on the ticket to see the film, and if I had to do it over again, I would wait until it came out on video.  This film can be watched on small screen and lose nothing at all."

""Reality"" based television, through Blair Witch and others, has adapted to a bigger screen, only now its called ""method filmmaking,"" so say the Blair Witch filmmakers. Their improvisational filmmaking, however, is not new to cinema. The trend may reveal a youthful audience that is growing passive to traditional storytelling techniques, a trend that suggests a danger of sorts.<br/><br/>American filmmaker John Cassavetes, Faces (1968), Husbands (1970), and many European directors like Ken Loach, Kes (1969), Carla's Song (1996), and Mike Leigh Naked (1993), Secrets and Lies (1996), use improvisation to develop character and dramatic tension. The use of cinéma vérité in Blair Witch, though, is another clever device which may further convince the audience that what they are seeing is ""real."" This, of course, is also not new.<br/><br/>The French New Wave filmmakers also used hand held cameras for the same reason as the Blair Witch, and most independent filmmakers do. It is much less expensive to shoot on location with a small crew, on videotape and 16-millimeter film, and a tape recorder, than it is to pay for a studio, professional actors, and state-of-the-art equipment and effects.<br/><br/>So what is so new about method filmmaking? Not much.<br/><br/>Not even the marketing objectives for Blair Witch are new. The Beatles made a bundle on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and the albums that followed by the developing the myth  that Paul McCartney was dead (I am the walrus!). Alfred Hitchcock used hyperbole for the marketing of Psycho (1960) by announcing in trailers and on posters for the film, ""No one . BUT NO ONE . will be admitted to the theatre after the start of each performance of Psycho."" Hitch implied a seriousness and immediacy which helped to create an interest in the unknown.<br/><br/>So why is Blair Witch so successful? Most reviewers mention the clever use of style and the filmmakers' objective of wanting to ""Make this thing to be 100 percent real."" The strength of Blair Witch and other ""reality"" productions such as MTV's Real World or Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1993), is the ability to draw from our sense of what is real and how it is represented.<br/><br/>In the same style that television reveals space walks, or provides point of view shots from deadly smart bombs falling on invisible enemies, - all ""real"" events - we see three college kids, tormented by unseen demons, run in fear into foreboding darkness. Their fear is real, our reactions tell us, and their absurd video camera captures their irrational and eventually hopeless flight. This style vividly recalls the terror of wartime film journalists during nighttime firefights (where is the enemy?). The effect is real, immediate, and frightening.<br/><br/>If we are to believe that television reveals the truth, then we must also sense that there is a truth to a production using similar production techniques. If audiences begin to expect a truth from fiction, that there must be something ""real"" in dramatic narrative cinema for it to be entertaining, we enter the spin city world of Paul Verhoeven's RoboCop (1987). When that happens, audiences will literally believe anything they are told, and what is ""real"" may turn out to be fiction after all.<br/><br/>Does anyone remember a person named Nixon?"

","I watched The Blair Witch a few days ago, because it took some time for the release here in Brazil.This is an interesting and innovative motion picture, with great actings (Heather Donahue is fantastic), great lines (there is one specially funny line in which one of the friends mention Deliverance) and some scary moments. Different from other horror movies, is what you don't see in The Blair Witch that almost turns you crazy, is the psychological aspect of the tension, of the loneliness that makes it so great!the ending is really frightening, and one of the most intense moments show the friends inside a hut at night, and then they start to hear children voice: it's the most powerful part!"

","I can say that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the most disappointing film I've ever seen. I was expecting something very creepy and impressing, but that's what I saw: three annoying and dumb amateur actors (specially Heather Donahue, that doesn't stop screaming and groaning) who don't divide their fear with the audience. Result: I simply hated this film.<br/><br/>OK, there are no special effects, but it isn't a reason to bore us. The directors expected to put the audience as a 'fourth character' but they couldn't come even close to this. Only the 'actors' were scared. Telling the true: Snow White's witch stepmom is much scarier than the little Blair witch, who doesn't frighten even a child afraid of monsters from outer space.<br/><br/>Everytime I expected the night to come in the film, but nothing happened and the morning always came again.<br/><br/>And the end? There's no end and we think: 'Oh! Why did I spend my precious money with this piece of crap?'

"Artêmis","1","0","1","2 October 1999"," The biggest disappointment I had in my life
","First of all, WARNING SOME SPOILERS IN THE COMMENT<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project is for sure the stupidest movie I've seen in my life. I had listened and read a lot of good things and opinions about it and I was expecting something incredible and terrifying but what I found was one film less frightening than the Team Rocket in Pokémon, the purple Teletubbie and Dr. Evil in Austin Powers.<br/><br/>I simply didn't fell scared in any moment. It's so silly. Only stupid Americans that believed this documentary was real liked it. It sucks!<br/><br/>The unique moment I felt pleasure in watching this was when someone in the theatre, tired of Heather's screams (as all the audience), shouted ""SHUT UP"". Everybody laughed. After it, all the people (more than 150) in the theatre hooted when the credits appeared.<br/><br/>I really can't believe how someone felt scared in this piece of c**p. It's boring and nothing happens. During the day they only walked and walked and during the night they had to turn off the camera for the witch not to know where they were.<br/><br/>I really think that the problem is that there are very much stupid and ingenuous people in USA. How can someone believe all this was true? That's the only chance to like it. As all the people around the world know it's a silly and not creative story, I think The Blair Witch Project's average rating will fall. The worst is that as they wanted American people to believe in the story, they made everything so real that the movie got boring. And they never show the witch or killer or murderer, so the documentary looks really real. If you are supertitious, you can think that there's a witch in the forest. If you are not, it's possible for you to think that a crazy murderer is killing everybody. So all American people were able to believe in the documentary. How smart they are!<br/><br/>I'm until not sure about my vote. I wanted to give it 1, but I'm thinking about 2. The end of the movie is a bit interesting and unusual although many people think the end is the worst part, it's the only bit I liked!<br/><br/>In summary it's a horrible, silly, boring, slow and childish movie. And who said it's the best horror movie ever made should be arrested for offending Hitchcock and even Wes Craven!"

","I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was original and the cast did a good job of convincing you that what they were experiencing was real. It is a low-budget movie and it shows but I expected that. Yes the camera does move up and down, up and down to the point that it can really bother you. To me a movie like this is a refreshing change from Scream and all of the other teen flicks that have come out the past few years. The main difference between Blair Witch and the others is that BW is actually scary and creepy whereas the others are too busy making jokes and showing shots of buxom teens with low-cut sweaters.

","The Blair Witch Project, set an example for many movies to come.  With a budget of only 36000, this film was able to create a horrifying film.  This proves that money and special effects don't make the movie.  The Blair Witch Project is a story of three filmmakers, who are creating a documentary.  As their curiosity thickens, however, they find themselves lost in the forest of the Blair Witch.  Over the next few days, they realize that they may never find their way back, and gradually their optimism disappears.  The amazing part about this movie is how they are able to frighten you without even showing the Blair Witch, or having the villain pop out and scare you. In this film, the terror builds up gradually, instead of very quickly, and allows the fear within you build intensity.  The final scene of this film, to me is an interesting outcome, but I will leave you in suspense.<br/><br/>Original, and very scary.........*******(7 stars of 10)."

"Transit","7","0","1","26 September 1999"," Innovative technique. Not quite as good as it could be done.
","I spent a surprising amount of time trying to decide how I felt about this movie. It was not the scariest film of the year, nor even the scariest film of the month in which it was released, If you're looking for pure chills or something that will make you scream along with the protagonists, you won't find it here. It is, however, quite entertaining, and disturbing in a fashion that falls in the general realm of terror. <br/><br/>The choice of storytelling medium is the instrumental deciding factor in making this film worth the price of admission (or of rental). It is such a total departure from typical Hollywood glamour and high tech fests that it imparts a deep sense of realism that could never be achieved by any other means, no matter how sophisticated the industry becomes. But the decision to use ""amateur footage"" as the sole medium for the storyline is paradoxically both the strong point and the greatest weakness of this film. First, the story couldn't work any other way without a serious rewrite. It would be too hokey any way but the way in which it's presented. But in the form of ""real life"" footage, it works. At times, the effort to make the footage look sufficiently amateurish to seem real is strained and in some cases overdone. At others, the very unprofessionalism is what makes it so moving. For instance, Heather's taped apology to their parents. Bad camera angle, no obvious makeup, bloodshot eyes, and a shot so unglamourous that even when you've read the disclaimer of fictionality, you still think for a moment... ""are you sure this isn't real?""<br/><br/>But the most critical decision point is whether we believe that all of this would make it onto film. There is a pivotal scene in which Josh condemns Heather for ""still making movies"" when they are lost in the woods. She replies, tearfully, ""It's all I have, okay?"" Miss that scene, and you'll never stand any chance of believing that so much of this story ""realisticly"" made it onto film. Simply put, these are aspiring film makers whose life training has made it a deeply engrained habit to film everything. That's as close as you'll get to an explanation for the completeness of the film records here. Still, it's a tough sell. There are things you still can't believe got on film, yet without these scenes, the story would lose a lot in the<br/><br/>translation. That's the double edged sword: show too much, you lose that natural realism, show too little, you lose the story itself. Clearly the film's producers were treading a thin line here.<br/><br/>It worked. Just about. But there was still room for improvement."

","There is a craze that is currently sweeping the country, or maybe it's more like some type of misdirected phenomena.  It's called ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and it has received almost as much hype as that long-awaited ""first"" entry in the ""Star Wars"" saga.  Make no mistake about it; the Blair Witch is definitely something to marvel at, even if it's more for its utter stupidity than anything else.  Filmed in 16mm black-and-white, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is filmed like a documentary.  After about five minutes of watching the camera wobble from the ground to the sky and back to the ground again, the viewer is overcome by a splitting headache and a desperate urge to vomit.  Actually, much of the film is spent with the camera directed at the ground, leaving the viewer to wonder if the filmmakers were looking for the Blair Witch or merely looking for rare species of ants.  With a running length of 87 minutes, approximately 75 minutes of this time is consumed with the student filmmakers, who are the center of this lowly production, running around in the woods, lost, screaming obscenities at each other.  One is left to wonder that if they would have shut up and actually walked for a little while, they would probably have stumbled upon a strip mall within 5 minutes. But that obviously wouldn't be interesting enough. So forward we trek with our documentary crew, fully absorbed in the frightening reality of their situation.  While the threesome soon run out of food and supplies, the camera continues to roll, as if it's powered by a nuclear generator.  I don't want to give away any more details about this ""fright-fest,"" but let's just say that the three leads in this film are intolerable at best, and are representative of everything that the youth of America stands for: incessant chain-smoking and rampant profanity.  How proud we are. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.  I found myself highly anticipating this film upon its release, due to all the great thing I had heard about it.  After about 30 minutes, however, I was hoping that a fellow audience member would feel as cheated as I, and do everyone a favor and go on a mass killing spree in the theater.  The producers wish to promote this film by saying that it is ""the unseen terror"" in ""The Blair Witch Project"" that makes it so darn scary.  After viewing this travesty, though, it is my belief that the witch is never revealed simply because the movie was so damn low-budget.  1.2/5 stars."

","Spoiler Alert: This film contains the scariest heaps of pebbles and most menacing twig-wrapped chicken giblets ever to grace the screen. Real Spoiler Alert: Nothing happens in *The Blair Witch Project*. Nothing.<br/><br/>There's no witch, there's no suspense, no chills, nada. There are three grubby-looking drama queens running around in the woods, painfully aware that they've been instructed to scare up a little fear. It's possible to conjure terror out of the ether; Dreyer's *Vampyr* did it more than 60 years ago. But there has to be some sort of intelligence behind the camera, if not in front of it. Horror is a genre that depends on phrasing; it thrives on tension and release, created on film much as they are in a piece of music. The structure could have come together in the editing room, but it didn't.<br/><br/>Nothing in the movie is phrased properly. Mike freaks out much too soon, bringing disagreements to a head before they're motivated. The tedium of our unhappy campers fails to translate into a sense of their tiredness. Heather emerges as a doggedly faithful chronicler, improbably refusing to relinquish the camera, though she (and Josh) record nothing cinematically effective. Everything's a stolid closeup or a jerky pan. There's only one advancing shot that gives any sense of an ""out there"" that could be inhabited by unseen evil. The eye simply bounces off the rest of it. Not that we ever believed in Heather's film credentials. In the beginning, she undermines the impression that she's a documentarian by failing to conduct a single successful interview. She interrupts each of her subjects before she gets a usable quote. By picture's end, we want to see her get it in the neck, but, alas, are denied even that pleasure.<br/><br/>The actors are clearly at a loss. They never refer to ""the map"" when ""the f**king map"" will do. There's nothing wrong with a little profanity, even a lot of it. But our trio uses it desperately, lamely attempting to create an atmosphere of urgency by ""f**king"" their dialogue to death.<br/><br/>I live four miles from Wheaton, MD, where some of the early scenes were filmed. I saw the movie in the theater closest to Seneca Creek State Park. Intrigued by the concept and bolstered by the hype, I was rooting for the home team. But I feel ripped off.

","The movie Blair Witch Project was a supense horror that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The movie was excellent from the acting to the special effects.  The movie was based on three student filmmakers who wail doing a documentary on the Blair Witch get lost in the woods.  The legend of the Blair Witch states that Elly Kedword lured several children into her home and drew blood from their bodies.  She was charged with witchcraft and sent into the woods to die.  A year later at least half of the town's children vanished, while the town's people feared that they should never say the words Elly Kedword again. The one thing that stands out the movie was the special effects.  One of the best special effects of the entire movie was how they set it up for  the students to be the ones filming the movie.  The way the camera always moved during the movie is what made it so good; they set the seen with it.  See, that just gave the movie life.  It makes you thinks like you are in the movie,like you are running away.  You do get scared by watching the camera shake in fear like you are. The second thing that stands out in the movie was how they set the scene.  How it was so dark in the woods ans the Witches were able to hear the charter hearts beat fast as possible.

","The eerie tale of three college students entering the woods where the Blair Witch, supposedly lives. The very recognizable plot also the theory emphasized, the un-seen equals scarier. The simplistic tale probably had many directors in Hollywood, kicking themselves pondering why they didn't think of it first. A film I fo one say should be awarded for for well efforts and acting. Bringing the film into a well perspective on how a true human acts. 	Immediately seeing the commercial it is recognizable what the plot is, three average college students that are goofing around want to make a documentary on the Blair Witch. Trying to gain further imformation they set out for the woods to find out what really lurks in the deep foliage. as the plot thickens the audience knows that their in the woods, loose their map, and lost. Pressing on farther into the woods, they slowly under go phases of a mental breakdown. On top of their stresses to keep a steady mind, they are introduced to many incounters they wish not to see. Examples of piles of rocks around their camp site, stick figures that mimic a human body. All these visions and phases, slowly tears the group apart. from then on they know something is following them. Another day passes and the students are never seen again. 	Is the seen or un-seen scarier? The un-seen from my perspective seems a tad bit scarier. Not to know where this so called witch is in the night as the strange noisese fill the night air. Not knowing how far or near she/he is they sit in silence scared out of their minds.

It was funny and I am calling it the 'feel good comedy of 1999'.  It should have been called 'What happens to people who aren't quite smart enough to get on Springer'.  Like Springer, you can not believe most things you see in this film.  This is not a documentary, regardless of what you hear.  From years of working in video, I can tell you that no one can get that much usable footage while hopelessly lost and starving in the woods.  I have to give this documentary credit, it did achieve something that has not been seen in a while.  It made a horror movie, without showing buckets of blood or even a monster.  This was quite clever.  <br/><br/>As a public service please remember the following when you are venturing to the great outdoors looking to film a witch, bigfoot or Pat Buchanan.<br/><br/>5.  Carry a gun.  Even though I am not a fan of the NRA, you are in the woods and the assault rifle is more feasible as a tool for taking down large game (i.e. Pat Buchanan, etc.) in this environment.<br/><br/>4.  If you look around at your group and there are no Asian, Hispanic or African Americans in your party, this is a bad sign.  Abandon the trip and rush home and try to catch that rerun of 'Friends' that you like so much.<br/><br/>3.  When you wake up the first morning and notice a strange arrangement of stones, a bleeding tree, or a severed head on a stick that you swear wasn't there when you went to bed last night. Consider abandoning the trip.<br/><br/>2.  If there were four of you when you went to sleep, and only three of you when you woke up, proceed immediately home.  Don't waste your time searching for your 'lost' friend.  He or she probably had something to do.  When you get back home you can call their house and leave a message or something.<br/><br/>1. Consider the monster's feelings. They may be hiding from the mob, their ex-wife, their ex-husband, VISA, the IRS, the student loan people, or sixty minutes.  Leave them alone.  When they want to be found, they will be.  If you do continue to pursue them and get mistaken for their pursuers , oh well, at least you got it on tape."

There was NOTHING violent, maybe just ONE scene or two, and it was mild. I got so mad after watching it!<br/><br/>Ok, this movie suffers the same fate, but triple. Quadruple, even.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the movie was bad or anything, it was just NOT SCARY!!!! Why do people have to say this was scariest movie of all time??? There was not ONE DAMN SCARY THING IN IT. Ok, there was one piece of something red, that you don't even know what it is. Looks like flesh. But whatever.<br/><br/>This movie is not scary.<br/><br/>Seven was a scary movie. It wasn't that scary.. but there were a couple scenes I'll never forget. The Pedophile who was tied to his bed for years, and who was still alive. A living skeleton. That scene scared the sh*t out of me (it didn't scare me... it surprised me... people confuse ""scary"" with ""surprising"". If someone sneaks up to you and yells in your ear... that's not scary. That's a ""surprise"". But people call that scary when that happens. That's so wrong.) Still though... I would lie awake at night and think about that guy. He ate his tongue to stay alive. He was a living skeleton. It disturbed me. And that was good. That's what a good movie should do.<br/><br/>The Blair Witch Project was a walk in the park. Nothing was scary at all. Go watch, I don't know... episode #.. um.. 212 of the simpsons. Or no... um, read a random page from the LA times. Whatever. The Blair Witch Project is no scarier.<br/><br/>Ok, the camera shaking. People say the camera shaked so much that people would VOMIT. WHAT THE HELL???? It didn't shake that much!!!! Hey I hope you guys who said that don't go sailing. You won't get seasick... you'll probably die.<br/><br/>Also, the camera was SUPPOSED to shake around a little. These guys were hiking through the woods with packs strapped onto their backs. Packs that were almost as big as they were!!!!<br/><br/>Also, don't complain that the movie ""looked like a home movie"". Jeesus christ, it IS a home movie!!! They used a handheld camera to film it! What do you expect? Con-Air?<br/><br/>But there's nothing scary. You never see what is chasing the 3 people. Rocks and sticks are left around them. But those aren't scary either. Screaming and yelling and crying and fighting and shaking and trembling... that's not scary to watch either. Hell I watch that every day in my dysfunctional family!<br/><br/>Here's where the genius is: Movies cost around 100 million dollars or so to make. Half of that just pays the movie stars.  Then, say, 200 millions dollars to advertise in your face all day. Then the movie has to sell hopefully 700 million dollars over the course of its run, to make 4 hundred million dollars. Of course, then there's the whole crew and studio that got paid their salaries, and royalties, and paying back loans, and the big guys cash out with maybe a hundred million bucks. Ok, the Blair Witch takes $30,000 to make. But for some reason, idiots are SO scared by it, it's called the scariest movie of all time, they market it on the web for almost free, and it ends up making over a hundred million bucks. It made just as much or more than a full production film. That's genius. Congratulations Heather, Mike, and Josh. You guys fooled America and cashed out. Ain't this country beautiful??"

But Oh My God, it sucked so bad!  The only thing scary about this movie was the big ball of tear stained, snot dangling from the actress's nose while she was confessing to the camera.  Unless of course your afraid of rocks and sticks.  The constant jerky movement of the camera combined with the perpetual whining amongst the characters almost makes you want to puke.  In total, even though I do agree the idea of the unknown is more frightening than the known, this movie is seriously a joke.  It's good only in the fact that no movie like it has actually made it this far and somebody is actually making a lot of money off of it and I can't say that I wish it wasn't me.

","The good, the bad and The Blair Witch... The fact that I saw Blair in a small theater did not help my perception that it really belonged somewhere in the realm of a college film production class and the annual showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Yes, I realize that the rawness is part of the reason so many thought that it was an incredible experience.  I can not begin to agree.<br/><br/>The good: incredible acting on the part of all of the characters in this film, especially Heather Donahue as herself.  They truly convince me that this was film from an amateur's escapade (unfortunately part of the bad.)  I could see their emotional decline and feel their hopelessness and frustration.  The bad: Almost all character development was diminished by the monotony of the plot (see bottom for generalization  WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILER).  I was at no time scared by anything in the film, and toward the end was wishing something, anything, would really happen.  The Blair Witch: Where is she?  Who is she?  What the h*ll is she doing? <br/><br/>
All in all, Blair seems like a reoccurring nightmare.  When it's over, you're really relieved and hope you don't have to go through it again.  The Blair Witch Project proves that you can have almost flawless acting, but if you don't have a direction, a plot or some sort of clarification, you can't have a truly great story.  I can't tell you that Blair Witch is the worst movie I have seen.  In fact it wasn't bad at all, but it definitely has a sense of not belonging in theaters and a lot of filler.

This, however, doesn't seem to phase our heroes who hike into the creepy forest of Burkittsville.

The fat chick lives and has to explain why she was thin on camera.<br/><br/>The Inexperienced Everest Climbers Project<br/><br/>3 Film Students film maker set out to find the elusive Yeti on Mt Everest. They expect a quick hike, but get lost and freeze to death. Film is found with strange long white hairs on it  at the bottom of a deep crevasse<br/><br/>The East Bronx After Dark Project<br/><br/>3 naive Film Students go to East Bronx to make film about urban decay. They get lost.  They see burning effigies. They get lost, robbed, mugged, raped and murdered by the locals. Film turns up a year laterin a pawn shop.<br/><br/>The Zapruder Film Project<br/><br/>3 film students go to Texas as part of a documentary on a president.  While there they ask a local to hold their camera while they unload. The local walks away with it. Later the ""Lee"" frustrated over not being able to film the event storms off to go to the movies. Misses assassination of political figures. Leigh later gets killed by Jack for losing camera. Everyone else who sees our knows anything mysteriously dies.<br/><br/>The Were Bitch Project<br/><br/>2 Film makers go on a hike to film foliage with their snooty blue blood girl friends.They get sick of them complaining. So they ditch them in the forest accidentally leaving a camera behind. The film is found a year later by the Lost Independent Film Finders. The documentary shows the women filming each other putting on make up and commenting on how thin they are. Eventually they whither away and disappear.<br/><br/>
The Bear Witch Project  Project<br/><br/>The makers of Blair Witch Project go back to the Hollywood for a follow up. A murky mess where people dressed up like bears stalk and kill campers that make forest fires. The makers get lost in a sea of sex, drugs and hangers on. Unfortunately with cost over runs the 2nd movie is shut down half way through production. All the Blair Witch Project profits are lost.  They go home penniless, and work at local a supermarket.

I liked the premise, but with a budget this miniscule, even Orson Welles could only do so much.  The only people who may find it frightening are those that have never spent any time in the woods at night, and as such might find the dark and the occasional bump in the night unsettling.  This film has no special effects, no substantive screenwriting (most of the dialogue consists of the principals shouting ""f*ck"" you, this etc.) and no compelling performances in it.  Cheap shaky-cam shots abound, however, of third-rate actors portraying sniveling characters coming unglued after spending a day or two, mostly intentionally, in the forest despite having plenty of food, water and shelter.

ANother thing I recommend is when the movie turns pitch black close your eyes and listen deeply to the sounds cuz they really make the scene more intense. The bottom line is to find out more about the mythology behind the movie before you watch it even though you know its fake.

Some of the folks unfamiliar with art / experimental films have found theirselves without a benchmark and have aligned themselves loosely along this film's marketing efforts.

If I had been in the characters' place, I'm pretty sure I'd be freaking out too.  However, I seem to fall into the camp which claims the film isn't scary.<br/><br/>What could be called scary about the film, though?  Aren't there definite moments meant to create fear in the viewer?<br/><br/>From short clips used in trailers of what looked to be people running in the dark of night, I inferred that they were being chased by an unseen monster. To my dismay, in the film the characters are the ones trying to do the chasing -- tracking down the source of some unexplainable sound.  Any running in the dark in film fails to be frightening for this reason.<br/><br/>There are also some scary anecdotes, stone piles, stick figures, sounds in the darkness that the characters could certainly hear better than I could, a stick bundle encasing bloodied clothing and flesh, and finally a deserted old house.  I'll admit that the bloody piece of flesh perhaps raised a hair or too, but wasn't close to giving me the kind of shivers I got from the film Seven -- which I use as my personal standard of a scary film.  I was prepared not to be able to sleep the night I saw TBWP as I wasn't able to when I saw Seven.<br/><br/>The house is the only element that seems to tie back to the beginning stories which could be used to stir up more fear, for it was in the basement of a house in the woods where some children in the 1940's were killed in a particular manner, not by any witch, but by a man who admitted to it.<br/><br/>My final reaction was that it was unrealistic and somewhat comedic."

In this respect,it doesn't live up to it's hype,(how could it)?,and if this is the sole criteria on which it is judged,it is bound to disappoint many viewers.<br/><br/>For myself, a film made on a shoestring, eschewing overt violence, gore, and bloated Hollywood style special effects is a long overdue breath of fresh air. Additionally, I found the story compelling. The way this trio moves from initial camaraderie, to petulant arguing and sniping, and finally to panic and hysteria is finely conveyed.The last few minutes were unsettling rather than frightening, but I can't help but admire the filmmaker's conviction in crediting their audience with some imagination.<br/><br/>In short, this is a film that will not please everyone. (Few worthwhile things do). But it should please most patrons who don't check their brains at the door."
"Doc Q.","1","0","1","22 August 1999"," I didn't like it.
","This movie was horrible.  It was more funny than scary, but it wasn't even remotely funny.  I'm sorry, but to be lost in the woods with a compass is rather inept.  I think all three of the main characters had to be seriously unintelligent to get and remain lost.  It was innovative, just not positively so.  I mean, if this is how horror movies will be in the next millenium, I'll check out the romantic comedies.  I give it very few points, mostly for the slight innovation and the concept.  Overall, it wasn't scary, nor was it an entertaining film."

They try (and fail) to make U believe that the movie is a real footage of a bunch of bozos that got lost in the forest. The also managed to convince some of the (scary part is that some refers to quite a lot) people that the whole idea is tremendously original - well it isn't. For one the unsteady amateur like camera: That was done  several times before (and with much better affect, for instance in 'Man Bites Dog'). And having amateur like unsteady camera is one thing, but the picture being so bad that its barely watchable hkhm... People getting lost in the wilderness and faced with extreme conditions: Much (MUCH) better done in 'Deliverance'. People getting on each others nerves: 'Who's afraid of Virginia Wolfe '. People going slowly insane: has anyone seen that play 'Caretaker' or 'Birthday Party' (by Harold Pinter) and finally people doing stupid things: what about 'Dumb and Dummer'.<br/><br/>Well since acting on some parts is even better than the local amateur theatre group so I rate this movie 2/10."

The Blair Witch Project is yet another cheap trick from no-talent film-makers trying to give us the 'fright of our life'. The only difference in this movie is that it is made by amateurs using shaky cameras, which only detracts from the film.

And while this is certainly an interesting exercise in improvisational scripting, it's no match for a well-crafted script with a beginning, a middle & an end.

While its neat that you get the ""handheld HI-8"" effect, it doesn't lend itself to easy watching on the big screen.  In fact, if you get motion sickness, stay away.  I expected much more from something hyped as one of the greatest thrillers of all time, and I was sadly disappointed. Perhaps ""Three Morons Lost in the Woods"" would have been a more appropriate name for the film.  It would all be worth it if it was at least a little bit frightening, but it even fails at that.

","I was drawn to The Blair Witch Project by the media hype and by Roger Ebert's praise for the movie.  I knew that something was amiss when I saw posted on the door at the entrance to the movie a large printed sign which read, ""Warning: To date, fourteen patrons have complained of motion sickness while viewing this film.""  I computed that the warning had to be a reference to the continual jerkiness of a hand-held camera, the same kind of camera jerkiness that caused me to walk out on the first thirty minutes of the Normandy Invasion in Saving Private Ryan - millions of dollars spent on recreating the invasion, yet not allowing the viewer to fully take in the horror and detail of it all - a cinematic cheat.  The Blair Witch Project is well suited to cinema at the university level - avant garde, simple exercise in horror and suspense, use of a hand-held camera to show disorientation, etc.  Great for teaching film-making techniques.  But to place this 16 millimeter student-like film in general distribution is to rob $8 admission-payers of their hard-earned money.  We get from a movie what we bring to it:  I live in a forest much like the Maryland forest in the movie and do not find forests creepy; anyone with a scintilla of sense knows to look for moss on the trees to know which way is north; I do not believe in witches; and, I believe that paying audiences should receive a dramatic payoff of some kind after investing 80 minutes in a movie.  For these reasons, and others, the Blair Witch Project fell far short of the mark.

","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a fascinating, but fatally flawed film. Like an inside joke, the movie assumes a greater understanding of the mythology behind the story than is given in the movie. The significance of story elements are lost amid the jostlings of the camera and the breathless (and frequently unintelligible) narration of events. While this jostling and narration contribute to the tension experienced by audiences in the later portion of the film, they prove to be little more than a one trick pony.<br/><br/>The film is well paced and edited, ratcheting up the tension as the filmmaker-characters experience the mysteries of the Maryland forest. However, it is an empty tension. It is difficult to willingly suspend one's disbelief when (1) the characters themselves defy empathy, and (2) their decision-making and behavior reflect a woeful naivete and lack of basic survival instinct.<br/><br/>""The Blair Witch Project"" was fascinating in that it pushed a documentary narrative technique to its limit. The editing and pacing is well executed. The sound is serviceable, and the cinematography (such as it is) perfectly matches the desired atmosphere. The performances by the filmmaker-characters were remarkable.<br/><br/>That said, the film is flawed because of a presumed understanding of background mythology, a reliance on manic first-person narration, a lack of characters worthy of empathy, and unbelievable behavior and decision-making on the part of the filmmaker-characters.<br/><br/>I understand why there is electric hype surrounding this film.

","This movie stinks from beginning to end. It's a waste of time and money. I went in without any proconceived expectations. I knew it was a low budget film and that production value would be minimal, and I expected it to have many faults. But I rarely walk out of a film and I was on the verge of walking out of this one at least five times. Not from motion sickness, but from the nausea that these guys pulled the wool over so many eyes and made so much money from a film that can't even be deemed a decent ""student film."" The story line is decent. The acting moderately passes. But I couldn't wait for someone to put this film out of it's misery! For what it's worth, this film could have been 20 minutes, with the same ending, and been much better!

"Siuloir-2","Null","0","2","15 August 1999"," (Mild Spoilers) re: the money shot
","So I've been reading horror by Joyce Carol Oates recently, and I've been astonished and refreshed by how she writes without any moneyshots.  A ""moneyshot"" is a term from the porn industry:  the close-up of the male climax is apparently the high point of most straight male porn flicks, and in the industry they call it the moneyshot.  I got to thinking how most horror, book and film, uses moneyshots:  the teacher turns into a multi-tentacled alien, the vampire appears in full glory and starts killing folks off, the demon is summoned and holds the severed virgin's head in its hand.  Whatever.  Oates deliberately avoids moneyshots in her fiction, leaves the reader a little bit frustrated, never resolves the tension she builds -- and the horror is all the greater.<br/><br/>Seems to me that that's what the BWP is trying to accomplish, and that's a major reason why a lot of folks don't like it.  There's barely any moneyshots in the movie.  The tension builds, but the directors never let you release the tension.  There's never an appropriate moment to scream, so the screams stay on the inside.<br/><br/>Some folks have criticized the characters in the film for acting unrealistically.  I wonder how many of these critics have gone camping with cityfolk?  In unfamiliar environments where they're incompetent, folks can get crazy real quick.<br/><br/>The camerawork functioned very well.  The characters were off-kilter, frantic, crazy; the camerawork prevented us from gaining our balance once we got sucked into the story.  And Josh's brilliant minispeech about Heather's use of the camera --""Now I see why you like this thing:  it filters reality, lets you believe it's not real"" -- neatly reversed itself, suggesting that we ourselves were filtering reality and best remove the filter.<br/><br/>The twiggy props were terrifying.  It's hard to believe that a sane mind would think of building them, and then could create them so well that in the latter half of the movie the whole woods looked like one massive malevolent twiggy prop.  Anything more polished would have shouted, ""Hollywood! Hollywood!"" and allowed us to distance ourselves from the movie.<br/><br/>I'm grateful for the audience with which I saw the film.  I would've wanted to kill anyone sniggering in the theater.  However, when the movie ended, the entire audience was stone cold silent as we filed out the exits, stunned.  My girlfriend clutched my hand bloodless and kept telling me, ""I'm *never* going camping again.  I'm *never* going camping again.  I'm *never...""<br/><br/>I hope more horror fiction will learn its lesson and leave out the moneyshots."
"RumblePen","1","0","3","16 August 1999"," Interesting, Fun, but definitely NOT Scary
","I heard about The Blair Witch Project months before the first TV commercial for the film aired. I counted the days until the first showing in my area. After reading reviews that declared it ""scary as hell"", ""terrifying"", and ""the scariest film ever"", I was almost certain I was going to be frightened for the first time since watching The Omen and The Exorcist.<br/><br/>As a young boy, who sincerely believed in the devil (thanks to my mom), the two films were especially terrifying because I truly believed what I was watching was real, or at least possible. That, I believe, is the only sure way of scaring an audience. The Haunting was such a disappointment because there was no way you were going to 'buy' those blatantly apparent special effects. Moving books and opening cabinets with fishing line is more frightening than rendered graphics (didn't those episodes of Sightings make you at least a bit more uneasy?)<br/><br/>And that's why The Blair Witch Project appealed to me. A horror movie that feigns reality, achieving frightening effects with simplistic techniques (or so was claimed). A documentary film-crew of three investigates a local witch legend. The three disappear and a year later their footage is found (probably within a bundle of wood or under a pile of rocks opposed to a film can). Great! What a concept! But the film isn't executed properly.<br/><br/>The film was shot with very little preparation, relying mainly on improvisation. The result is a film that is very funny, but not very suspenseful or shocking. Humor is something that can easily be improvised, but not suspense and horror. They need to be brought about by the manipulation of sounds and images, not by running frantic with a video camera.<br/><br/>I in no way doubt the integrity of the actors' performances, but I need a little bit more than their fright to make it my own fright. Piles of rocks and bundles of wood just don't cut it. Sure, they along with the stick figures that are discovered are freaky as a preliminary, but I require something more dangerous. Phantom hands, Shadows, two points of light that could be evil eyes off in the distance, even grasping branches would have satiated. I spent most of the time scanning the screen looking, hoping to see SOMETHING.<br/><br/>Sadly, the filmmakers give you nothing. You leave the theater unsure of what exactly accosted the three. Was it sadistic practical jokers? Rednecks or devil worshippers? A witch or malevolent spirit? I'm afraid you'll never know. I didn't want full disclosure, just enough to make me think ""Maybe Mom was right, the devil IS out to get me!"" Less is sometimes more, but nothing will always be nothing. After all, a house isn't haunted if it hasn't any ghosts.<br/><br/>Some argue the point that if I were one of the three lost and haunted filmmakers I would be scared. No doubt. But I would just as soon be afraid of what happens in a Will Smith movie if it were happening to me.<br/><br/>So, is this movie worth seeing? Sure. I did laugh quite a bit and any movie that does that is no waste of time. There are two very tense scenes, but they are quickly over before they can be called ""terrifying"" (the final scene is especially disorienting). Although, be warned, those likable characters soon become annoying as they get lost in deep, deep Maryland and begin fussing and fighting. You may be longing for their deaths and find what does befall them disappointing. So, see this movie, but don't tell me ""it'll make you afraid to go into the woods"". Deliverance has already done that.<br/><br/>Last Note: Here's a funny thing you can do in a packed movie house showing The Blair Witch Project. When Heather, Josh, and Mike first discover the pile of rocks outside their tent, scream, ""Oh my God! Rocks!"", then, frantically run up the aisle, through the theater doors, never to return."

You must imagine that you are in one of the other theatres, watching a different movie. This movie must be one of the most disappointing films in a very long time. The most devastating blow to its credibility was that there wasn't one genuinely scary scene; only 3 scenes could even be described as potentially scary.<br/><br/>The acting, admittedly, was passable; the reactions of the cast were about what you would expect from the 3 filmmakers. However, although the idea was good, the execution of this film was very weak. How can you try to psychologically thrill your audience, when the sound is so horribly done that you can't hear the sounds that the characters are afraid of? In addition, some of the events that make their situation worse could have been handled by some unexplained phenomena; I highly doubt anyone would kick their only map into a river.

I saw it with a mind untainted by hype, therefore I had almost no history on the movie except that it was supposed to be real footage.  With that in mind, these comments are from the perspective of a viewer who was skeptical at viewing time about authenticity and needed to find affirmation of doubts.<br/><br/>Immediately after viewing the movie, I had a few criticism of the film, if not suggestions for the characters:  to begin- WEAPONS!  I would ask if anyone brought at least a boyscout knife, but everyone was so frightened during the movie, I doubt that it would be used anyway.  Plenty of sharp sticks hanging around, and piles of nice rocks for projectiles.  ...they didn't even try. second- DROP THE CAMERA AND RUN!  Is it dedication to their documentary, loyalty to Heather, or just plain craziness?  I understand that a movie would be a radio program without the visuals, but at some point even the most obsessed would value their life more than making a film.<br/><br/>If one suspends disbelief, however, the film has some good qualities, which makes the premise work.  It was consistent in portraying all shots from the view of the two cameras as opposed to an audience view.  It was also plain in its style which made it seem like the work of film students.  Some shots were too deliberate in their use of space, focal point, etc. however, for someone who would be running or looking around out of fear and holding a camera.  Another good quality was that the characters seemed genuinely afraid.<br/><br/>Despite the comments of other critics here, the fear-factor *is* there, depending on what one finds frightening.  For myself, the house at the end of the movie is not unlike houses that are in my nightmares, and not being able to escape from something that is chasing me has also been nightmare material for me.<br/><br/>The good with the bad, what is my overall impression of the movie?  Hmm... I can't help but think of the impact of ""War of the Worlds"" or of Milli Vanilli ""exposed"".  Maybe I just didn't get it from the beginning, that the viewer wasn't actually supposed to think that it was real.  Despite the movie's authenticity, or lack thereof, the real masterpiece is not the movie itself.  That is, this film probably shouldn't be critiqued on a movie website, but on one for marketing strategies.<br/><br/>On that note, although I liked the movie from a cinematic point of view, I can't help but feel duped by the movie makers- like my money in their pocket is just one more chuckle for them.  I would recommend that the movie be seen, but in doing so, I would just be another victim of the marketing ploy of its creators.

However, it will never be more than it was - a gigantic hoax on the movie-going public.<br/><br/>Blair Witch did some interesting things - the use of method acting to the extreme, where the actors were issued secret instructions and forced to go without food and sleep, etc. Creative and ""real"" as it is however, the film falls flat on its face. <br/><br/>Heather is shrill and annoying throughout... her ""method"" acting reminiscent of a bad introductory college acting course. Thus, the psychological horror that the film is going for never quite hits the target. The 'seasick' inducing camera shots don't help, either.

","The Blair Witch Project deserves an A as film class final project. The concept is good. The throwback to the pre-special effects days where the imagination was loosed to create horror/fear is fine.  As entertainment a C is much closer. The ""forest"" has been great in myth and literature as a frightening place where trees blot out the sun and poor lost waifs wander. So how do we get stuck with this scrubby excuse of a forest? I've been lost in far scary forests and this one would have been a joke. Then we have the acting... There isn't much worse than reaching the end of a movie and the only remaining character is someone you hope dies quickly and painfully. Fortunately, from the beginning we knew all the characters had disappeared and were undoubtedly dead so we had little to stress over. It is just amazing how many people have seen this ""ink blot"" of a movie and managed to project their own imagined story lines, fears, stellar performances etc into it. I haven't been a fan of  all white or all black paintings that profess to have some deep insights into life.  It is commendable that with not much more than that the directors were able to catch an audience willing to fill in not only the details but all of the main ingredients.

With each passing minute I kept waiting to feel scared, but it never happened.  I liked the idea of the actors filming the movie, and the dialogue was fresh as it was unscripted.  I was even one of the people who actually thought this stuff happened and that some of the footage was actually from the missing students.  Even with that mentality, I was not frightened.  I was using my imagination at full throttle, and the movie just left me empty.  I guess the ending was good for one reason: it was consistent with the rest of the movie.  I kept saying to myself, ""Something good is going to happen now....."" right up to the ending. After seeing the ending, nothing good happened.  I give it an 10/10 for marketing, 6/10 for the concept, but only 2/10 for the film itself.

","If the big deal about TBWP is that it leaves things up to your imagination, just get yourself a good book from the library.  If you're really scaring yourself you can get much better inspiration from any of thousands of books than you will get from this film.<br/><br/>Also I miss out on what is scary because I not worried about getting lost in the woods.  I have simple knowledge of the great outdoors that tells me if I can find freshwater I can survive seven days without food following my compass or a stream and will find something before the end of those seven days that will lead to my rescue or return to civilization.<br/><br/>Next point is that if the Blair Witch is out to get you, you're dead meat; a powerful supernatural force that has escaped human recognition for all these years is not going to be uncovered by three bumbling students with camcorders.  Rather than losing your mind inside a tent, open the flap and get killed by the supernatural or find out you were going crazy over nothing.  Do what the audience of the film can't do and take charge of the situation rather than slowly losing your mind, like the tent would protect you if the s**t hit the fan anyway.<br/><br/>And if you are impressed by the lack of budget, you are just strange.  It costs you the same to see the movie regardless of what it costs to make; be impressed by their ability to promote the movie on the cheap or applaud their financial success; but in no way should you think a movie is better because it was made for less.  Think if this movie is so good why not impress a studio and get some more money to improve the movie before releasing it to the general public; if they did this you could have gained from the low budget as a two-step production would have shown you a better final product.<br/><br/>$800,000 (in 1960 dollars) got you a set that is still standing today, the services of one of the greatest directors of all-time, an actual screenplay, known and quality actors and the greatest horror of all-time.  Psycho got the money it needed to provide the audience with everything it could hope for; TBWP just turned $30,000 (in 1999 dollars) into an immediate profit for a select few and what will be nothing more than obscure movie trivia in a few years for the masses."

","""The Blair Witch Project"" is not the scariest movie. It isn't even scary. It is a bit eerie. However, it is so crudely filmed ($100,000 budget) to reflect its feeling as a student documentary film, that it works against itself. So much of the screen time is devoted to a black screen or shots of grass and trees shot with hand-held cameras, that it is just annoying. The most atmospheric thing about the film is the soundtrack composed of dialog and weird sound effects. The hype around the film's origins and promotion on the Internet is just that, hype. The movie just doesn't have much entertainment value. It is just a curiosity, and audiences are flocking to it just for that reason. I suspect they will be as disappointed as I was. The writers/directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, gave the gist of each day's shooting to the three actors who use their own names for their characters. They then just took the two cameras, one 16mm black & white and an RCA video camera, and improvised the dialog and action to fit the generalized plot of the day. The actors should be given screenplay credit. Their performances are natural and in its final sequence amazingly real. All of the film's creators will probably go on to more expensive productions in the near future. Possibly then their creativity and talent will be more fully realized."

","The hype behind this movie is phenomenal and i give credit where credit is due. The marketing behind this movie is genius and still today, several weeks after its nation wide release, there are still some who believe that this is real documentary footage. Of course, no studio would ever purchase actual footage and turn it into a major motion picture. Real documentary footage and home videos are reserved for the FOX television network and shows like RealTV. But that's besides the point. The movie itself is not very good for a couple of reasons. The first reason is unavoidable, but darn it, i got so dizzy watching this movie that I spent much of the movie looking away from the screen in order to stop myself from getting sick. I was expecting it, so it didn't come as a surprise, nevertheless I almost lost my lunch. The second reason is that this movie was not believable. I'm sorry, perhaps their nighttime footage was believable, but I didn't buy into their daytime footage with their little quarrels and soliloquies. It was highly exaggerated. The third reason, to go along with reason number two, is the ""townspeople"" at the beginning of the movie. Not to spoil it for someone who hasn't seen it, but the ending was more realistic than the two fishermen being interviewed. There was no way anybody could watch these two clowns and believe they were real. By the time the movie got to the end, i was too upset with the camera and with the girl to be scared or creeped out. It might have been a cool ending, had the previous hour and ten minutes not ruined it. I almost wanted to leave during this movie because it was so bad.

","You've heard the viewer testimonials.  You've been to the website.  You've seen the ads, and you know the premise.  Upon entering the theater, prepare to experience an incredible letdown in both the horror and story aspects of this film.  The Blair Witch Project almost seems to have fallen prey to its own hype.<br/><br/>This is not to say this is a bad film.  The Blair Witch Project has no less than three things working for it that have rarely been seen in recent cinema.  The low-budget advertising campaign and the savvy move of keeping the national number of screens to a minimum were both brilliant marketing schemes.  And clearly, not many recent films have kept pushed the envelope of truth/fiction.  The Blair Witch Project wants you to decide whether this is a true story or not, and one cannot easily make that decision while watching this movie.<br/><br/>But who cares?  One problem with realism is the complete lack of creativity and imagination displayed by the movie.  As an exercise, imagine you are camping in the woods with two others to research the supposed existence of a witch.  Think about what could go wrong.  This film takes all those ideas and runs with them, making you say ""I already thought of that"" at just about every turn.  If your imagination is as ""vivid"" as mine, you will feel like you have already seen this movie, which tends to ruin the suspense. Although, the climax is certainly worth the wait, making it the only part of the film that meets, or perhaps exceeds, the hype.<br/><br/>Go see the Blair Witch Project for the climax, a scene you will be thinking about for days.  But take the movie (as a whole) as an average horror film with a different edge, and see if you like that edge.  Your mind may be messed with, but it certainly will not be blown away.  This movie is low budget for a reason."
"Roark-9","Null","0","1","8 August 1999"," Three people decide to make documentary in the woods...three people get lost in the woods...three people freak out...that's all folks...
","Good Lord, this is the first movie I've seen in years were I actually wanted to ask for my money back. When exactly was I supposed to be scared? When these three (actually two: Mike did an adequate job) over-actors woke up to some foot steps or a few small piles of rocks? Or, while--for about 50 minutes--these unsympathetic characters just walked around the woods in circles, cursing, because they were lost. The only thing keeping me on the edge of my seat was the fact that I kept on wanting to get up and leave out of sheer boredom. But, alas, I hung in till the end, assuming something would happen--eventually...and it did, in the last five minutes...a final five minutes that certainly did not justify the previous 81 minutes. There might have been enough substance here to hold together a short, but that's about it...and that's pushing it. All in all I can not say that this feature film had any redeeming qualities. Suspense: ney; Cinematography: obnoxious; Dialog: with the exception of the line, ""this stuff couldn't have been made by rednecks, it's too creative,"" it was flat, uninspired and, if any indicator of these actor's improvisational skills, a wake-up call for these people to choose a different profession; Drama: You got us lost. No, you got us lost. No, you did. No, you did...etc...(pretty intense, eh? see Dialog:); Sex: zilcho; Humor: All the hype the movie's getting; Action: redundant.<br/><br/>Obviously, these film makers have yet to be let in on the independent's secret: when you are dealing with a limited budget you optimize your production value by making up for the  poor cinematography, set design etc., with stimulating dialog, dramatic tension and story line (e.g. Pi, Clerks, Swingers)...At least Artisan exhibited some artistic talent in their manufacture of the hype.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I was reminded of a quote that Stanely Kubrick used to win an argument he was having with Jack Nicholson during the filming of the Shining: Jack wanted to say a line his way because he claimed it sounded ""more real,"" to which Mr. Kubrick replied, ""It might be more real, but it is less interesting."" That about sums up this movie: Maybe it appears to be real, but it certainly isn't interesting.<br/><br/>The saddest part about this whole experience is that now there is sure to be numerous ""rip-offs"" of this film...looks like The Blair Witch might have cursed us all."
"OdeLute","3","0","2","14 August 1999"," Over-hyped
","Look, I know that as a college student and film fan I'm supposed to prattle on that this was the coolest, scariest film ever.  Well, it's not.  The idea behind it is great, the execution is decent, but when it all comes to an end I had to agree with the rest of the audience I saw it with: ""You mean, that's it??"" The ending didn't leave you hanging, it just left you.  This was the first film I ever saw where the whole audience responded at the end with a collective ""You've gotta be kidding me, what the heck was that?"" Plenty of people have said it scared them away from camping, all it did for me was make me a little nauseated (The Blair Sick Project strikes again) and wish I still had the money I paid to see it.  Maybe I won't go camping in places I've heard witch stories about now, but I doubt I would have before. You'll most likely go see it anyway, but I honestly don't know why."
"G-Man-25","4","0","2","13 August 1999"," Much Ado About Nothing
","I'm not sure this movie is worthy of all the hype being heaped upon it.  I wanted the hype to be valid, I REALLY did.....I'm a big fan of independent films, so I wanted all the rave reviews to be true....most of all, however, I wanted to be SCARED!!!   Hmmmmmmmm.....well, I liked the way the filmmakers set up their story in the early scenes, giving background in to the whole Blair Witch legend, and there was the promise of a few mild chills.....but I found most of everything from the mid-section on to be rather tedious.  There were a couple of things that really kind of negated the whole thing for me.   The characters behaved increasingly more stupidly and illogically as the movie ran on (not TOO different from any other horror/slasher film, eh?).  And I know it's supposed to me a mock documentary but let me ask you this:  If you're awakened in the dead of the night out in the forest and scared totally witless, would you REALLY take the time and bother to pick up a video camera and film yourself as you're running away???  NO!!  You're terrified!!  Forget the camera!!  You'd just take off running like your very life depended on it!!  I'm not normally one to sit and actively poke holes into a story like this, but that fact just bugged me.  Maybe it's because of all the hype and people (even big-time critics) falling all over themselves and calling this a new classic...well, I don't buy it!  It's a nice try, but the entire group of people I went to see this with also gave it an ""is that all there is?"" shrug.  It just isn't all it's cracked up to be."
"anyte","Null","0","1","13 August 1999"," Why did I bother?
","May I just say that I do NOT recommend this movie.  The jerky hand-held camera being carried through the woods by running people made me feel nauseous.  I left the theatre after the first half-hour or so because I felt ill.  After the end credits began rolling I went into the bathroom at the theatre only to hear a girl vomiting. I wasn't the only one unable to enjoy the film, I guess.  The plot wasn't too bad, the idea of it was rather interesting but very Very poorly executed.  Speaking of executed, I'd rather spend a month camped out in the woods outside of Burkittsville, Maryland than see this movie again."
"Primtime","5","0","2","12 August 1999"," Highly Overrated
","With The Blair Witch Project, I have read and heard many an overrated reviews. This film simply isn't all that amazing. Rather than what others say about being shocked at the last ten minutes of the film or being scared throughout, it just doesn't ring true. What really got me was the fact so many people still sat in their chairs after the film was over. Someone was even crying. I haven't seen that kind of reaction to a film since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Even Eyes Wide Shut, which is a much better film had no one staying afterwards.<br/><br/>One can talk of the raw emotion that this film conveys to the viewer. I have a problem with this though. Not enough of the film is seen on camera. During the late night scenes in which someone or something is moving around the tent, we never get to see the looks on the faces of the actors. A lot of emotion is heard, especially during the last quarter of the film, but since I couldn't see it happening, it all seemed rather phony to me.<br/><br/>The fact that this film will in time become the most profitable of all time just goes to how much impact hype really has. There hasn't been a person who I talked to about this film that doesn't want to see it. The truth of it all is that I have seen much better films this summer including EWS and American Pie and would recommend these over BWP any time. This film is definitely a rental.<br/><br/>5/10 stars."
"EJK-3","1","0","2","11 August 1999"," Incredibly over-rated and NOT scary
","this movie has received more hype than it deserves.  while the premise is incredibly original and clever, the actual execution and story are weak, and there are some glaring holes in the story line.<br/><br/>#1 -- even though it is 1994 --- who would go into the woods in the middle of nowhere WITHOUT A CELL PHONE, or at least not driving the car.  and why would you film this if you were being chased by a witch.  even though you have to buy into the fantasy of it all, i just couldnt due to so many holes.<br/><br/>it was not scary and the hand held camera is sure to give the weak of stomach major problems  (it did for me)<br/><br/>to much hype"
"Mr. Snow","3","0","1","9 August 1999"," Atmosphere isn't enough
","Yes, this movie is extremely creepy.  The atmosphere alone can give you nightmares.  But atmosphere isn't enough to make a truly great film.  The movie begins with a caption telling us that 3 filmmakers went into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch and disappeared.  Then the movie begins and then it ends and we've learned nothing more than what the opening caption told us.  I knew they went into the woods and disappeared long before I saw the movie.  I expected that seeing the film would enlighten me in some way about what actually happened to them and what was really out there in the Maryland woods, but the credits roll and I still know nothing. Actually, that's not true.  I know some more of the story because I went to the Blair Witch website, which provides much more information than the actual film does.  I figured we'd get to see the ""discovered footage"" framed by a ""documentary"" about the disappearances, with experts and friends speculating about what happened to the missing trio, but all ""The Blair Witch Project"" shows us is the missing footage.  Period.  That's it.  With nothing to frame it, it tells us nothing.  Three people went into the woods and disappeared.  I knew that much from the commercials.  Are they dead? Are they captive somewhere?  Was it a witch who got them?  A homicidal maniac?  I still don't know.  I can't help but feel that after shelling out $9 to see the movie, I should have more of a grasp on those answers than people who've only seen the trailer."
"KG140NY","3","0","1","8 August 1999"," Just didn't do it
","Maybe it was the hype, but this was an all around mediocre film, which I probably liked less because the hype was so much.  Excellent concept, excellent premise, but it was no 'The Omen'.  I understand what was trying to be done here, but to be honest the one piece of information which you didn't want to know (that all three are going to buy the farm) was plastered up on the first frame of the movie.  After that it was an exercise in conclusion.  You knew they would die, it was just how that was the issue. And the how was a pretty boring trip.  I must admit that the stick figures creeped me out and the last 30 seconds were intense.  But honestly I just am not intimidated by a pile of rocks.  I know, I know, it's the simplicity of the whole thing that is supposed to make it work, but I just didn't find it very scary.<br/><br/>The other thing, and this bothered me too, is that streams turn into creeks turn into rivers turn into lakes and oceans.  In the first 30 seconds they show that they have a field guide with them, but apparently no one read it. Follow the stream!!!!  It was almost like watching a cheese film where the dumb victim runs upstairs when the zombie is chasing them.  I suppose the possibility of intense magic precludes this as an option but we never get the inkling that that is the reason.  Instead, by the end, I almost felt like our heros get the benefits of their stupidity.<br/><br/>Regardless, I must give kudos for I wouldn't have done better with $60,000 and I've seen much worse with 10-100 times that amount.  It's an OK summer movie, but it is not overwhelmingly scary or intimidating<br/><br/>David Campbell"
"Foggy-7","4","0","1","9 August 1999"," Real World IX: Crystal Lake
","First of all, I give a lot of credit to the three main actors for their believability; most notably Heather Donahue as the goal-obsessed director of this doomend documentary.<br/><br/>But it wasn't scary. More important, for the film to work, you had to see the right footage. Heather, Mike, and Josh of course, just happened to have their cameras running at the right times for us to get a full sense of the picture. (Even edited down from complete footage, it still strikes me as odd.)<br/><br/>The ending, for me, failed to leave me with enough information to want to have questions about it. It simply left me with a feeling that this was Real World IX: Crystal Lake."
"zebeth","3","0","1","7 August 1999"," Is it over yet?
","I'm not a horror fan so I won't complain about the lack of gore but I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.  The acting wasn't bad but this is a low budget film and it looked it. Once the kids went into the woods it was just the same thing over and over. At the theater I was at, people actually got up and walked out.  I went relying on reviews and the ""93"" rating. I should have read the other user reviews.  If you must see this movie, I would advise waiting for the video."

","pretty stoopid movie - where was scary part ?? the camera shakes so much (just to show that it is in the hands of amateurs) that it gives you a head ache .. i think it's another of the media hyped movies or the only other reason that people are lining up to see it is that people are so sick of big budget movies that they dig a simple low budget plot for a change - other than that i wouldn't advise any body to waste their time and money to see this movie .."
"gartner","4","0","1","7 August 1999"," Interesting concept; but not nearly up to the hype
","I just saw the Blair Witch Project and must say that I was disappointed.<br/><br/>My real disappointment is that I went into the film just hoping to be scared out of my wits. I found myself on the edge of my seat waiting for the moment when I would be so overtaken with fright that my stomach wouldn't be able to take it. That moment never came. <br/><br/>Were there moments of great tension? Yes. Were some of the events in the film freaky? Certainly. Was it the greatest horror movie ever? Hardly.<br/><br/>It was a very interesting concept, but in the end the most scary part of the film is that I found myself driving home woozy from the scattershot home video style.<br/><br/>I would not advise anyone not to see the Blair Witch Project, but I would warn not to expect too much."
