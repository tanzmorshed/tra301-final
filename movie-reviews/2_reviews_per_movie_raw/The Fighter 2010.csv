"Matt_Layden","8","82","95","23 December 2010"," The Fighter is a winner.
","The story of Micky ""Irish"" Ward and his boxing career with his crack addicted brother at his side. Apparently Marky Mark was so hell bent on getting this film made that he stayed in ""shape"" for years and years just in case the film went into production. That's dedication and passion for you, yet the man still manages to be the weak link. <br/><br/>It's not really his fault, David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. Christian Bale plays Dicky Ecklund, Micky's crack addicted brother who tells the same story over and over again, about him knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. It's his claim to fame. There is a film crew following him around, he thinks it's going to be about his comeback, yet it's really about the harsh realities of crack addiction. Bale, again, submerses himself in the role. He is pure method. You can not like him as a person, or even an actor, but you can't deny his passion for the art. He is on the thin side again, with thin balding hair and brown teeth. He looks deathly ill in every scene. The man has one of his finest roles to date and will no doubt be nominated come award season. I hope he actually takes home the award. He is without a doubt, the most interesting character in the film. <br/><br/>Their mother is played by Melissa Leo, another performance worthy of recognition come award season. Her desire to see her kids rise to fame blind her from the truth. She denies the drugs and the failures and believes she knows what's best for her kids. This means not letting them get a real chance because it would be with a real manager and she would be left behind. Family is important to her and she wants to keep everyone very close, even if it harms their chance at making a name for themselves. She of course, doesn't realize this. Amy Adams is the love interest, you know there had to be one. She manages to pull Micky away from the family that is dragging him down. They don't like her for it. She has her own inspirations too, yet the story isn't interested in them. The main focus of the film is with Micky's bumpy road to the championship fight. Since this is based on a true story, I can't really fault it for becoming a bit formulaic and predictable, yet it is. <br/><br/>David O. Russell is notorious for getting angry and violent with his crew/cast. He was in a physical fight with George Clooney on the set of Three Kings and anyone can go on youtube and check out the melt down he and Lily Tomlin had on the set of I Heart Huckabees. Both films coincidentally star Mark Walhberg, so it seems he doesn't have a problem working with the combative director. I can't deny that the man has talent. I really love Three Kings and found I Heart Huckabees to be an ambitious project for the sheer weirdness of it all. With The Fighter, he plays to a more conventional audience. In terms of boxing films, it works. It plays on the down and out character, the poverty of his life and the sheer determination he has to make a name for himself. It's no Rocky, or as others have mentioned Raging Bull, but it is good enough to be mentioned with them.<br/><br/>Russell always has an eye for a creative shot. Check out Three Kings colour scheme for what I mean. Here he uses TV cameras for the boxing matches. Interesting move, it feels like we are watching it at home and are not really in the ring with them. I admire directors who think outside of the box. Russell does this, no problem. He also decides to include real footage of the characters. The film has some home video segments throughout and during the credits we get to meet the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eckland, which is even more reason to appreciate Bale's performance. <br/><br/>The film trips a bit because of the lack of emotion from Walhberg. I dig the guy and enjoy his films, but his range isn't there yet. When given a role that he can play the absurdity of, he scores. Watch The Departed for that. For a film where the audience needs to get behind a character, to root and cheer for them to overcome their obstacles, he falls a little short. Thank goodness the film makes up for this with the performances from Bale and Leo.<br/><br/>The Fighter features great music, engaging performances and a predictable, yet true story. I felt attached to the characters and hoping they would make smart decisions. If a film can get me to care about the characters, I say bravo. <br/><br/>The Fighter is a winner in my books."
"littlemartinarocena","9","206","256","28 December 2010"," Wahlberg's Corner
","In many ways, ""The Fighter"" is the film of 2011. A family drama with a pugilistic background. The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didn't surprise me was Mark Wahlberg's signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovan's made for TV ""The Substitute"" Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlberg's strengths and ended up saying ""Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade"" I had Donovan's words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching ""Boogie Nights"". Wahlberg also produced ""Entourage"" and the startling ""In Treatment"". He now produced ""The Fighter"" and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I won't be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!"
"CarpeDiem12","7","9","9","15 March 2018"," Supporting Roles stole the limelight
","This a great American family drama movie. Shows the ups and downs of a big crazy family with 2 boxers in the family. The big ''legend'' Bale and his young brother Wahlberg. This story is about how the younger brother who looks up to his crack addicted older ''legend' brother for guidance and advice, has to turn away from him and his toxic family to succeed in his boxing career. <br/><br/>It shows the struggles of a young fighter as he attempts to turn his life around after always living in the shadows of his brother. How he faces dilemma's when confronted with his family and newfound love interest (amy adams) about what is good for his career. <br/><br/>Walhberg does a good job with his role but the supporting cast take the cake. Bale, Melissa Leo and Adams all acted incredibly and are worthy of the awards. This just shows how well acted this whole film is."
"jcaesar-01251","7","8","8","3 March 2017"," The Fighter driven only by flawless performances.
","Look, i like the film, I think it's awesome but I also think were the characters were played by less effective actors, this wouldn't be as awesome as it is. The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn't invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn't care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that's worth the concession price."
"Monotreme02","8","156","212","18 December 2010"," Conventional script elevated by great direction and fantastic performances
","After Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella man, and many others, one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world, and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed, watching The Fighter, one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, the answer is ""nothing much"". The script is a pretty conventional rags-to-riches story, whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother, Dickie Eklund. Luckily, Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script, with some problems with flat characterizations and unnatural-sounding dialogue. However, everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script, and for the most part, they succeed.<br/><br/>Russell's direction is absolutely fantastic. His use of the camera – which still has that indie looseness, free-moving and hand-held and gritty quality to it, which really adds to the atmosphere and energy the film tries to capture. His staging of scenes is fantastic and he usually just lets his actors riff off of one another, sometimes sticking to the script but sometimes talking over one another, interrupting, and creating a very dynamic back-and- forth that further lends to the realistic quality of the film and its setting. A fantastic rock- oriented soundtrack only adds to this energy and atmosphere. In terms of bringing something new to the table of boxing movies, Russell employs a very interesting technique of filming the boxing scenes as they were shown on HBO pay-per-view TV in the 90's; cheap video quality, multi-camera set-ups, the whole package. The boxing scenes were all shot over 3 days, which left the crew just enough time to run through one boxing match at a time and just shooting it as if it were an actual match, the cameras capturing everything, including mistakes and mess-ups and spontaneous, uncontrolled occurrences which yet again add to the very loose and realistic style the film attempts to capture. It is a very interesting and unique technique I have not seen used before, and I thought it was a fresh approach to boxing scenes, which have become very conventional ever since Raging Bull.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, this is a movie about two brothers and their overcoming demons and obstacles in order to succeed and reach their mutual goal, together. Being a character-based film, the success of the acting is a key to the success of the film, and luckily, it is in this field that the film succeeds the most. Mark Wahlberg is adequate in the lead role of Micky Ward. I have never thought much of him as an actor and think that he did an ""okay"" job on this film; not bad but not particularly noteworthy. However, his supporting cast all shine, and his chemistry with them, especially with Christian Bale, is really what sells the movie for me. Bale's achievement is nothing short of revolutionary. He completely steals the show as Micky's crack-addicted older brother and trainer, a former boxer himself, and a shadow of his old self, except he can still throw one hell of a punch and knows just what Micky needs to do in order to succeed. Bale completely embodies the role and really gives it his all – both in his appearance (hollow cheeks, bulgy eyes, balding) but also in his bravura performance. It is an incredible feat of acting, one of the best I have seen all year; Bale's best work as an actor yet, and totally deserving of all the accolades it will inevitably receive. Also worth mentioning though are the two main female supporting roles, namely Amy Adams as the tough and sassy but supportive girlfriend, and Melissa Leo as the overbearing mother. Both actresses are very much out of their comfort zone, which is just what makes their performances so good. Adams, who has never really shown her tough side like she does in this film, does a spectacular job, and really creates someone human and relatable out of what is otherwise an underwritten character. The same goes for Melissa Leo: her character could have gone the completely one-dimensional villainous way, but Leo adds a certain humanity to the character which just makes her seem more sad than vicious.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Fighter tells a pretty conventional story in an interesting and not necessarily conventional way. It is a film that could have been over-dramatized and heavy-handed had it been put in another director's hands (see Cinderella Man for an example of over- dramatization), but Russell and his cast reign it in and set out to create a very specific atmosphere and set a particular mood that lends the film a sense of realism and a very unique dynamic energy that, with the help of the fantastic performances from the cast, help carry it above and beyond its conventional script."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","45","57","27 December 2010"," Excellent cast focuses boxing drama on family dynamics not usual themes
","When it comes to winning awards, boxing films seem to always be contenders; as such, the thought of watching ""another boxing film"" can be off-putting. But ""The Fighter"" hangs in and fends off those labels, earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring; ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.<br/><br/>David O. Russell brings a needed dose of realism to the boxing genre, downplaying the underdog nature of Micky's true story and focusing on the relationships that push him through and hold him back all throughout his journey toward the welterweight title. Much of the time, in fact, the story feels equally Micky's and his brother's. Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), as beat over our heads early in the film, went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down, becoming the pride of small working-class town Lowell, Mass. — which as one might imagine, wasn't hard.<br/><br/>But Dickie, an off-kilter, fun-loving yet irresponsible guy (a transformative performance from Bale to say the least), spends the time he's not training Micky in crack houses. In fact, he's completely oblivious to the fact that HBO is following him around for their documentary on crack abuse, not one about his ""comeback."" It's clear that his behavior is keeping Micky, whose had a string of bad losses of late, down. After an embarrassing fight in which Micky was mismatched, Micky suddenly finds himself wondering whether he should keep his boxing career and family separate.<br/><br/>The idea of it irritates Micky's mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, who impressively embodies every controlling mother. Alice sits in her house most days and smokes cigarettes while her seven grown daughters pathetically vie for her attention. Leo keeps Alice from being an aggravating total monster, providing a more complete picture of a mother whose blurred the line between business and family.<br/><br/>Amy Adams also excels in her supporting role, a bartender and college dropout, but one who — like the audience — sees how Micky's family has kept him back and as his girlfriend pushes him toward the right path. Interestingly, as she grows more invested in Micky's career, the script divides her from the audience, which gives her performance more weight.<br/><br/>Russell's characters have a harsh reality to them, much like the Boston-based characters in Ben Affleck's films ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town."" In addition to looks, clothes and mannerisms, Russell chooses a more hand-held documentary feel for the film like Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler"" and even opts to film parts of the boxing sequences with lenses like the ones used in the late '90s to give the feel of watching a live broadcast.<br/><br/>The fights, though effective, remain secondary to the other ""fighting."" Watching Dickie spiral downward and come back up again, Alice have trouble letting go and Micky struggle to speak up for himself and recognize what he truly needs serves as the more compelling conflict. All together, they give ""The Fighter"" the best ensemble cast of 2010. And like all great boxing films, all these tensions blow in and out make their way symbolically into the boxing ring for that final fight. As Dickie urges on his brother in the waning rounds of the championship fight, he captures it perfectly when he says ""everything that's happened, take that out there with you.""<br/><br/>The emotional moments of ""The Fighter"" do lack a real knockout and many intimate moments are tempered with humor in awkward but not scene-ruining ways, but rather than be a heavyweight drama that rides the underdog story for two hours, ""The Fighter"" opts to be something a bit more natural by fixing on the right things: the people and the personal relationships that hurt or harm us, are all essential to our success.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","22","26","28 January 2011"," A Winner On Multiple Levels
","Does David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' follow the formula of underdog surpassing all obstacles and winning in the end (as is the case with this genre)? The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all, the four principle characters: Micky, Dicky, Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.<br/><br/>They are wonderfully defined and the actors who portray them are cast against type and turn in their finest performance. Both Melissa Leo and Amy Adams are like you've never seen them before and they appear very natural on screen. Mark Wahlberg is superly restrained and Christian Bale does one of his best works of his entire career. They are supported by a host of impressive actors.<br/><br/>In addition to the marvelous performances, the makeup department has done a remarkable job, especially by making Leo look old enough to play Bale and Wahlberg's mother. Bale actually does look years older than Wahlberg (when in reality he's a year younger) and that just adds more to the authenticity.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence, I was under the impression that 'The Fighter' was going to be a documentary-type movie but O. Russell tricks and surprises the audience with that. His execution is subtle unlike the loud approach which other directors commonly follow.<br/><br/>For me 'The Fighter', is more about the human connection than the sports itself. Boxing is clearly a metaphor as is the title which has multiple meanings. Even though he's been constantly let down by his family, Micky chose to give them a second chance and have them by his side. Even though Charlene disapproves Alice and Dicky's involvement in Micky's career, Dicky attempts to persuade her because he knows that Micky won't stand a chance without her by his side. Even though Alice and Charlene don't see eye to eye, there's a silent acceptance between them as they know that Micky needs them both.<br/><br/>I am really beginning to have more respect for Mark Wahlberg for producing gems like this (in addition to some amazing TV-series like 'In Treatment', 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'Entourage') and his growth as an actor is obviously apparent (he just needs to avoid tripe like 'The Happening' at all costs).<br/><br/>'The Fighter' is a winner on various levels."
"Red_Identity","Null","59","78","2 January 2011"," Great direction and performances make this an excellent film
","Do we have a lot of sport films where the underdog ends up winning and overcoming many obstacles along the way until the end? Definitely. Does The Fighter succeed? Very much so...<br/><br/>For a film like this it is very difficult to make it completely unpredictable, yet while The Fighter is in a way conventional, it is also unpredictable many times. It has great characters to boot, but also a strong cast that is willing to give it their all. This is the best ensemble cast of the year,, many amazing performances. First, I start off with Mark Wahlberg, who has been the most under the radar, but he is definitely up for this. He is a great lead and I am surprised he was as good as he was. I am also very pleasantly surprised by Amy Adams. Not to say she is a bad actress, but I was always used to her roles all being similar and now she is in a completely different role for her, and to say she succeeds is an understatement. She is excellent, and is only made strong when sharing the screen with any other actor. Melissa Leo is also great, and I think she is on par with Adams. The difference between Adams and Leo is that Leo has the more award-baity role. Now we have Christian Bale, who I do think is the best. I have seen his performances and while he has always been good, he has never truly risen above others in his films, here he does. He is excellent, and he as of now deserves that Oscar.<br/><br/>David Russel's direction is part of what makes this film so great, He soars scenes to unbelievable heights and I think that the screenplay in another director's hands would have came out with a merely good film. But here, we have an excellent film, perhaps better than 2008's The Wrestler, and one of the best films of the year."

","""O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena in perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his opponent."" Walt Whitman<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg has achieved a career high with The Fighter, not so much for his acting, which is eclipsed by a supportive cast that would be hard to beat in the Oscar race, but because he fought for years to bring the story of Lowell, Mass. to the screen. He caught perfectly the blue-collar town's karma and their devotion to the fighting brothers, ""Irish"" Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).<br/><br/>Director David O. Russell has assembled this cast around the idea that a town in the shadow of Boston can become world famous as its sons become winners in the ring. But then, Stallone did more for Philadelphia as Rocky, so what's the big deal? Like Ben Affleck's excellent thriller this year about Boston in The Town, Fighter captures place and struggle in equal dramatic measure as filmmakers take a close look at the working class's struggles over the last 30 years. While Million Dollar Baby (2004) focused on trainer and fighter and Cinderella Man (2005) gave a microscopic view of a troubled fighter and his small family, The Fighter does all of that with a vigor as exhausting as a bout itself.<br/><br/>The Fighter is not just about boxing because as in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull (1980), it's all about people who find in the sport a way to transcend their social prison. In The Fighter, it is more even about family, which weighs heavily on Micky's success or failure. And outside family as well, for girlfriend, bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), is a formidable force in liberating Micky from the suffocating family (his five harpy sisters and domineering manager mother, Melissa Leo, fearsome in her cigarette smoke and driving vision for her sons). Unlike other boxing films, Fighter is patient with Micky's long climb to success, almost painfully long but rewarding in the reality of its prolonged struggle. <br/><br/>But it's also the acting that distinguishes it: Christian Bale as Dicky transforms himself again by losing weight and morphing into a manic brother who loves Micky despite Dicky's negative life of drugs and mania; Amy Adams is believable as the gritty but beautiful girl friend; and Melissa Leo plays mom like a lady Macbeth in tight Dockers.<br/><br/>Although there will be heavier films competing for 2010's Oscar, I can't think of another whose cast so eloquently has caught the poverty and riches of a town caught in boxing fever."
"MaralynSpeaking","10","124","185","29 November 2010"," Everyone involved in this film just made a fan of me
","Such a fully satisfying film is a rarity. A story of family, struggle, and love told with great humor, intelligence and heart. I've already seen it twice and am telling everyone I meet to be sure to catch it. I was blown away by Amy Adams' touching performance in JUNE BUG and by the raw beauty of Melissa Leo's work in FROZEN RIVER, but have been slow to distinguish among the crop of young male stars and directors who deserve to be household names. Christian BALE, MARK WAHLBERG, and David O. RUSSELL are names now branded in my consciousness. This season I've been stunned by the creative forces at work in films including SOCIAL NETWORK and JACK GOES BOATING, but for its overall achievement, this amazing film based on the true story of two boxers from Lowell, Massachusetts earns a championship. It is much more than just a fight film or a biopic though it certainly sweeps us into the drama of the boxing ring and quivers with the diamond gleam of truth. Bale's finely etched creation of Dicky and Wahlberg's extraordinary dual turn as producer and star in the role of Dicky's brother Micky should place both men front and center for Oscar nominations along with Russell who shaped the film with a keen sensitivity. Russel's team of artists including cinematographer, costume and sound design were all spot on in their respective contributions. Tho Leo and her gaggle of daughters struck me at first as verging on caricature, I quickly saw that they perfectly captured the family culture while providing a delicious comic motif."
"ferguson-6","8","32","43","14 December 2010"," The Pride of Lowell
","Greetings again from the darkness. Don't let the hype or the fear of just another ""boxing"" movie keep you from this one. Yes, it is based on the true story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, but this is every bit as much a story of family and commitment and tenacity as any story you know.<br/><br/>Directed by David O Russell (I Heart Huckabees), the film does a terrific job of dumping us right smack into this blue collar community and this oh-so-colorful family. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, the younger brother of former boxer Dicky Ecklund (a no-holds-barred Christian Bale). Ecklund lived for years off his fight against Sugar Ray Leonard, where Leonard either was knocked down or slipped down. Either way, Dicky is as close to a local legend as it gets. In the mid-80's, younger brother Micky joined the fight game - with Dicky as his trainer and his mother (Melissa Leo) as his manager.<br/><br/>As realistic and believable as the boxing is in the film, the real trick was in presenting Micky's family. The first impression of his mother and gaggle of sisters is that it's a cartoonish presentation. In fact, it's very realistic! When local bartender Charlene (Amy Adams)becomes involved with Micky, she tries to set him straight on exactly what his family is doing to his career.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention that Dicky was a crackhead? Did I mention that his mother pushed him into fights against upper weight classes because she needed the money? Did I mention that Micky tries to remain loyal to the family ... even to the extent of nearly costing him a shot at a legitimate career? There are some real emotions going on all over this well-paced film. Thanks to the Amy Adams character, we really get to see how an ""outsider"" views the family, and vice versa. It's not a pretty sight! I can't say enough about Bale's performance as Dicky. He has the movement and gait of both a boxer and a crackhead. His mannerisms mirror that of the real Dicky, as seen over the ending credits. This is crazy good acting. Melissa Leo is fast becoming the hardest working actress in Hollywood. This is the third film I have seen her in this year! Her performance, when combined with Jacki Weaver in Animal Kingdom, really create some nightmares for kids with creepy mothers! Amy Adams is totally convincing as the pretty, tough love interest and guiding light for Micky. As for Wahlberg, he is quite convincing as a boxer. His physicality is without question. The only thing I didn't like was the couple of times he slipped back into his mumbling, whiny persona. Luckily that effect was minimal.<br/><br/>This is a film I would recommend to most. The only word of caution is the language is quite realistic for working class Lowell, Mass. In other words, the ""F"" word is utilized in every conceivable manner throughout. It's just part of the community fabric. Also, be warned that the boxing is also quite realistic ... it's a violent sport and that comes across very well. I loved how the boxing matches were filmed digitally for effect. Just a wonderfully well made film with terrific performances ... and actually quite uplifting!"

","This is the film that David O'Russell and the cast and crew have outdone themselves on. the best way to say it is WIcked outstanding. It not only told the story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, Dickie Eklund and the family aspect but was a credit to the real internal and external struggle of never giving up. ""the fighter "" does proper justice to the hardworking ways and the People of Mass and Boston areas. <br/><br/>In this film , the title has a double meaning as not only being a fighter as a boxer but speaks to many that in regular life that being ""The Fighter"" success can happen if you put the work in. The story does have strong female leads in this film that has never been shown in previous boxing based films. It is a cross over to both worlds ( male and female, Young and Old) and those that would usually skip a Boxing based film as it is much more then just that. <br/><br/>I was at screening of ""The Fighter"" in the Beverly Hills theater with Director David O'Russell and main Cast ( Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams ,Melissa Leo) The Director and cast show their love and passion for this film and how hard they all worked to make this possible in their very warm words and replies to the questions from the audience. In all , a class group of fine professionals and actors put their heart and soul into this one and I hope their efforts are well rewarded when it comes time to nominate and vote for Oscars."
"johnshinnick","7","5","5","30 December 2010"," It's a sports film that rises above the genre to become something better.
","The Fighter is based on the true story of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward's unlikely rise through the ranks to the WBU (World Boxing Union) light-welterweight title.<br/><br/>Micky's story would be a conventional sports film if not for the presence of his half-brother Dicky, a boxer-turned-trainer whose life was screwed up by crack addiction and the petty crimes that associated with that life.<br/><br/>The brother, played by Christian Bale, makes the story interesting and charges it emotionally. Bale bursts from the skin of his character, igniting every frame with his energy (reminding, occasionally of his role as the high-energy boy in Empire of the Sun). As in The Mechanic, Bale lost a lot of weight preparing for the gaunt crack-addicted brother. He was 100 per cent convincing.<br/><br/>Bale's character, Davy, exudes personality every time he enters a room or walks down a street. You know he is a drug-addled screw up and you know he is going to mess up his brother's life, but the brother loves him and is loyal to him so you want to see Davy rise above his problem.<br/><br/>One of Bale's best scenes was shot on the front porch of the house where Charlene, Micky's girlfriend (played by Amy Adams) lives. Clean and sober after eight months in prison, Dicky carries a ton of baggage to that porch. He has hurt people. He has conned neighbors. He has disappointed everyone but his mother and his half brother. The entire town of Lowell, Massachusetts remembers Dicky as a boxer (""The pride of Lowell"") but they also remember him being addicted to crack, so nobody is prepared to believe he has gotten past the addiction during his eight months in prison.<br/><br/>On the porch, Micky, knowing that he carries that baggage, wants to charm Charlene and patch things up for his brother. Charlene, however, is fueled by her complete distrust of Davy. She loves Micky and she has seen Dicky mess up Micky's life over and over again. On the porch, she has just walked away from Micky because he insists on being loyal to Dicky. No way is she going to be easily convinced that Davy has changed.<br/><br/>She is skeptical of every word to come from Dicky's mouth, but Dicky pulls out all the stops in an effort to overcome his baggage and connect with her to make things right for his brother.<br/><br/>The immovable object meets the irresistible force. It is a fine scene.<br/><br/>Amy Adams is equally amazing in this film. As an actor, she is gutsy. Even when she started to command bigger paychecks, she continued to make independent films and bring to those indie films performances that made them better than they might have been. She never shies from a challenge. In this role she plays a worldly bartender who flunked out of college despite a full scholarship in high jump. As an athlete, she can understand with Micky.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, it is Amy Adams who makes the chemistry work between Charlene and Micky. Wahlberg can be as wooden as Ben Affleck when it comes to romantic subtleties. Amy Adams in this role is like one of those good dancers on Dancing With The Stars who has to work with a partner who might as well be a post or a tree stump. While Wahlberg is unmoving, Amy Adams' performance reaches out and emotionally draws the scenes together.<br/><br/>The Fighter has dimension to it, and a lot of the depth from the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The mother played with conviction by Melissa Leo. She runs a family home surrounded by seven adult daughters, and all seem to either be living at home or visiting their mother a lot. The sisters are a hoot, sort of like a Greek chorus on a living room couch. Highly emotional, the sisters hate Micky's girlfriend. I loved them because there was something fascinatingly hideous about the sisters.<br/><br/>Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, and Cinderella Man are all fight films that have taken the viewer where The Fighter goes. No surprise there. Micky, as you expect, gets the crap beaten out of him. He struggles through the rank. He gets his shot at a title and he enters the ring against a better boxer to compete for a world championship. The sports genre always travels down a well-beaten path and always takes us to a happier place. Every sports film tells this oft-told tale. You enjoy the genre because getting there is what makes sports films a pleasure.<br/><br/>The Fighter benefits from the fact that it is not just a sports film but a story of family and redemption. You family is important, addiction is not unbeatable. The Fighter is a feel good film with a lot of ugly stuff to overcome.<br/><br/>IAlthough I put The Fighter along side most of the other boxing films, it could have been a lot better. If Micky had been more three-dimensional, the film might have been a classic. The elements are there, struggle and redemption. It's a true story with a lot of subtext, and that alone makes it better than Rocky. Unfortunately, Wahlberg is no DeNiro so it's no Raging Bull, and the script isn't up to Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>That said, The Fighter is worth seeing. You'll like it for the performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo and character actors whose faces you'll recognize from dozens of other films and television performances. You will love it for the feel-good arc, the love and redemption that are built into this genre.<br/><br/>If you like boxing, you'll love the action. The camera work in the ring scenes is first rate and convincing. On the big screen, you feel every punch.<br/><br/>However, if you are of that generation that hates boxing but likes cage fighting, there's no hope for you, sorry"

","Wow, what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction, and how it can affect loved ones. And above all, it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER, they feel authentic and brutal, but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama, no, far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny, and there are some humorously absurd moments, something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance playing the lead character, Micky. This is Wahlberg's most reserved and complex role to date. Micky has an unbreakable devotion to his family, which both strengthens and cripples him. He never really speaks for himself, and would rather suffer than upset those around him. Through the course of the movie the character really grows, thanks to the help of a good woman by his side. Mark Wahlberg shows a side of himself we've never seen before, this isn't the over-the-top badass THE DEPARTED Wahlberg, which don't get me wrong, is awesome too, but he finds a different range here. Truly the guy has come a long way from The Funky Bunch.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is absolutely phenomenal in his scene-stealing role as Micky's drug-addicted brother. This is such a great character that Bale really brings a lot of depth to. Dicky's easily angered, often detached and oblivious to how his affliction is affecting his life. He's also ashamed and vulnerable. He's not the most reliable guy in the world and he's in need of a serious wake-up call. But the thing is...you can completely understand why Micky would stand by him for so long. Underneath it all, he really is a great guy, full of energy and affection- somebody you'd really want in your corner. This is sure to go down as one of Bale's most remembered roles, and hopefully his enormous talent will finally be recognized by winning an Academy Award for it.<br/><br/>Behind every great man is a great woman, and Amy Adams also delivers a fantastic performance as Micky's girlfriend, who really helps him develop some backbone and at the same time is able to find some clarity in her misguided life. She's great in her role, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy the eye-candy she brings to the movie. She has her fair share of revealing outfits and in one scene is shown wearing a see-through bra. Now THAT'S great filmmaking! <br/><br/>Also notable, just because it stood out to me, is that Conan O'Brien's sister, Kate, has a role in the movie, playing one of Micky's sisters. I sort of wish I wasn't privy to this information before seeing it because her resemblance to the goofy talk show host is uncanny...and a little disturbing.<br/><br/>I don't know why a lot of the most involving sports movies happen to be about boxing, I guess there's just something so primal and against all logic about people that get the crap beaten out of them for a living. It's worth knowing what makes these people tick. Yes, this is based on a true story, but I'm sure it's been tailored to fit Hollywood needs. Events have likely been rearranged and certain moments probably fabricated or altered, but THE FIGHTER doesn't attempt to portray the family shown here in a completely positive light. Nobody is a saint here, and everyone has their faults. When it finally arrives at its conclusion it is relieving, satisfying, and yes, inspiring. This is ultimately a happy story well deserving to be told on film but the sad reality is that there are no doubt hundreds and hundreds of similar stories that didn't end up quite as well. I can't tell you what exactly makes the family depicted in this movie so special. Maybe they're stronger, and more willing to compromise, and just maybe a little lucky, too. But I was left recalling a scene from the movie THE STRAIGHT STORY, where Richard Farnsworth lays down some wisdom upon a teenage runaway: he told her how he would give each of his kids a stick and ask them to snap them, which was easy. Then he'd give them a whole bundle, which couldn't be broken. ""That's family."""

","When I worked in a kitchen one of my colleagues - Scott - was obsessed with films who seemed to spend every spare moment either in a cinema or at home with a pile of DVDs . I should point that he was someone who had no interest in anything art house . Everything Scott watched had to be either American , feature a big name or feature an action sequence so our tastes weren't very similar . Regardless of this one film Scott felt the need to rave about was THE FIGHTER . I'd seen the trailers and vaguely knew the story of Micky Ward and felt it was going to be clichéd true story bio-pic with embellishment and a happy ending . In other words it was going to be a seen it all before sports movie .<br/><br/>"" Okay Scott "" I asked "" What's the selling point ? "" <br/><br/>"" The acting Theo .It's brilliantly acted especially Christian Bale who plays MarkWahlberg's brother . He plays his trainer "" <br/><br/>Sometimes acting alone can't carry a film - only bring a film down and when I watch a film I'm after a good story so decided not to bother with THE FIGHTER until it was broadcast on Channel 4 . After seeing it I came to the conclusion that both Scott's opinion and my own are totally correct <br/><br/>Bale is an actor who is fortunate in that the roles he will be most remembered for are those that belong in a franchise such as BATMAN BEGINS and TERMINATOR SALVATION . You could argue he's luckier than he is talented but here as Micky Ward's half brother Dicky Eklund , a crack addicted , brain damaged former boxer he gives an acting tour de force . You know when you're on the bus and someone gets on and you mutter to yourself "" Please don't sit anywhere near me please "" that's the exact feeling you see when Eklund appears on screen . One wonders if Bale should have been drug tested after each scene such is his convincing performance . It's a story of mean streets and of mean people hitting rock bottom and you don't feel you're watching actors merely going through their paces<br/><br/>Where the film does fall down it's down to the usual flaw of making true stories dramatic and having to restructure things . Ward beats up and coming boxer Alfonso Sanchez which means he gets a world title shot against Shea Neary in Britain . In reality Ward fought another 6 fights , losing two of them before he got the title fight against Neary and with all due respect the title fight in question was for the World Boxing Union ( WBU ) which most boxing fans consider a mere "" alphabet title "" not a world title at all . Also the film feels the need to dramatise the fight with Ward being dead on his feet in round three . In reality Ward was wobbled in that round but didn't hit the deck . The fight was a slugfest for sure but was never as one sided as portrayed here . Perhaps most disappointingly of all Ward's three legendary fights with Arturo Gatti are relegated to a caption at the end of the movie <br/><br/>In all THE FIGHTER is the cinematic equivalent of the battle between Marvelous Marvin Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard . It's a definite split decision . You can se why people loved the film , you can see why people liked the film , you can see why people disliked it and perhaps why people hated it . I'm certainly hedging my bets and voting for a draw"
"aharmas","8","9","11","20 December 2010"," Knockout Performances
","There has been a trend this year to show the darker side of nature in movies, both on TV and on the movie screens, and ""The Fighter"" continues to expose those festering qualities that prevent us from bonding with each other and might end up having some very toxic results. However, ""The Fighter"" shows an interesting point of view, as it balances the negative with some redemptive moments; some of which shine because of a very outstanding group of actors.<br/><br/>For starters, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams surpass any work they have previously done as the obsessive and supportive female leads in the story. Leo, as the mother who is blind to her own powerful interventions and interferences, almost leading to the destruction of her own children. Adams, is a tower of strength, with a caustic underside. She is a vulnerable woman who has grown tougher because of her own life experiences, and she finally finds someone who understands and needs her. Still, she must now face a group of siblings who might prove to be more than she wants to handle.<br/><br/>In ""The Town"" we saw how the environment shapes the nature of human beings, and finding success is pretty elusive. In most cases, the results are the reverse and tragic. Mark Whalberg's Mickey has reached that crucial moment in his life, when he must choose to detach himself from a stiffling family environment and pursue his dream, with the proper support. It is time to go for his life's dream, and though it might be a little too late and very difficult because of Dicky's (Bale) constant self-destructive moves and their aftermath, Mickey might never see his dreams come true.<br/><br/>Bale, who has done superlative work in more than a dozen films, from his superb debut in ""Empire of The Sun"", completely outshines everyone else in the film, and regardless of the barrage of publicity out there, his is a leading man's turn, dark, subversive, suicidal, pathetic, emotional, and an effective and affective portrayal of a man who is about to hit bottom, someone who is now apparently unaware of how much pain his actions can cause. As the older brother who is now addicted to drugs, he can't see the way he is dragging everyone else into his own hell, especially Mickey, a resilient but sweet character who can't break away from this situation.<br/><br/>Eventually, fortunes change, and we see how it is possible to produce change. ""The Fighter"" never really explodes or overwhelms. In ""The Wrestler"" pain was intense both visually and emotionally, almost reaching torture levels for its protagonist and the audience. Here, there is a restrained sense of despair and even exhilaration is portrayed in an almost muted way. We want to ride the emotional waves of the main character, and this hardly happens. Unlike ""Milk"" where there was a documentary feel that make the events appear almost real, there is something amiss here; yet even that sense of detachment can't keep us from admiring the magnificent work done by Leo, Whalberg, Adams, and most impressively Bale, an actor who understands and undergoes the transformations required by the roles he chooses. It is impossible to imagine a darker Batman, a more demented yuppie, or a more traumatized child. In this movie, his physical and emotional transformation will bewitch you and add you to a list of admirers who have followed an artist who keeps delivering knockout performances, a true champion."
"joao-desousamiranda","7","4","4","10 July 2015"," The Bale show
","The Fighter is a biography about two brothers with modest beginnings in a small US city. Bale plays the older brother, a drug addict and a failed past in boxing practice. Mark Wahlberg is the younger brother, protagonist of the story and the sportsman's most successful in this dysfunctional family, though it be the cause of your lack of progress. Bale and Melissa Leo (played well a compliant and fanatic mother) won one Oscar with this film, but the role of Amy Adams is also relevant. Given the characteristics of the actors themselves, it would be hard to get better for the type of characters that exist in the film. I really liked the character of Amy Adams but Christian Bale's performance is awesome. One more character to remember."
"witster18","7","11","16","31 December 2010"," Great performance from Bale. This Could have been epic.
","Alright.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a true story about Mickey Ward - my favorite boxer. I grew up around this time, and watched most of the fights featured in the film. I recently wrote a sports-blog(for 4 years) about a variety of sports; boxing, football, baseball, basketball, etc. On one particular occasion I wrote a blog about 'The Top 20 Sports Moments Since 2000'. Amongst them were Michael Phelps' Gold Medal barrage, Usain Bolts' 100 meter world-record, and the 2004 Red Sox winning Major League Baseball's 100th World Series, which ended the Curse of the Bambino. What was #1? What event/moment did I single as the greatest? Mickey Ward's first fight against Arturro Gatti.<br/><br/>It was a fight that made movies like Rocky 3 marginally realistic. The brawl of brawls. The most violent, epic, unforgettable, irreplaceable, 'shake your hand on your buddies head'' moment of sports Godliness. It took boxing fans back to the pre-depression days of bare-knuckle fights and hard-men, and reminded us of the euphoric heights of heart and determination that can be captured in sport.<br/><br/>Not even a strong performance from Christian Bale can make up for that sports' moment being left out of this screenplay. We can only hope that Aronofsky's drama/comedy will get non-boxing fans to look into the career of Mickey Ward - so that they might see that fight.<br/><br/>Bale's performance is amazing, but I don't think that Mark Wahlberg really captured the role of Mickey in the same way. At least he didn't immerse himself into the character in the same way as Bale, and the biggest resemblance he had with Mickey was his physique.<br/><br/>This was a very good movie; entertaining, fast-paced, with a brisk running time. 'The Fighter' isn't quite as good as its' current ranking here, but it should crack the years Ten Best, IMO. <br/><br/>The boxing scenes are more realistic than most, and the interaction between Mickey's family and circle of friends is priceless.<br/><br/>Good. Not great! Nudged out 'The Town' as the best movie I saw this week. If Wahlberg was on par with bale, and if this had gone another half-hour and included the Ward/Gatti fight, it might have scored as high as a 8-8.5.<br/><br/>75/100<br/><br/>Solid Recommendation.<br/><br/>You'll like it if you like: Bull Durham, Without Limits, Conviction, and Rocky Balboa."
"sol-","Null","3","3","25 February 2017"," Two Brothers
","On the rise to fame and success, a young boxer must decide whether to continue training with his family or seek professional training and management elsewhere in this sports drama based on true events. Mark Wahlberg is solid as the conflicted boxer in question and Amy Adams does well cast-against-type as his foul-mouthed bartender girlfriend, but is Christian Bale who steals every scene he is in as Wahlberg's older brother. A former boxing legend himself, Bale has delusions of grandeur and believes that the TV crew who have recently arrived to film him are making a documentary about his long awaited comeback when in reality they are making a film about his descent into heroine addiction. The overall film fascinatingly follows this structure too, opening with a lot of focus on Bale, only for Wahlberg to be eventually revealed as the true star (what a great metaphor for Bale's character coming to realise that not everything is about him). Melissa Leo also gets quite a bit of screen time as the brothers' overbearing mother, however, the rest of the family are disappointingly barely fleshed out all, including Jack McGee as Wahlberg's father, who could have been quite interesting given that he actually sides with Adams about his son's career. As for the sisters, they are all interchangeable stereotypes. This is, however, principally a film about the brothers and their every interaction is compelling. The end credits are also worth watching here for appearances by the brothers whose lives the film was based on - Dicky and Micky Ward."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","3","12 September 2016"," A Powerhouse Of Riveting Performances, The Fighter Is David O. Russell's Best Film To Date
","Powered by terrific performances from its cast, The Fighter also happens to be David O. Russell's best film to date that may not rank amongst the finest examples of its genre but it still serves as a competently crafted sports biopic that's less about the sport & more about the athlete, his family & his path to redemption.<br/><br/>The story of The Fighter follows the life of professional boxer Micky Ward who withdraws from the boxing world after suffering a humiliating defeat in a match he already had reservations about. The plot chronicles the journey he takes to get back into the ring while focusing on his relationship with his brother whose own life has taken a self-destructive route.<br/><br/>Directed by David O. Russell (best known for Silver Linings Playbook & American Hustle), the story journeys the same route that majority of boxing films tend to take plus also falls flat in between on a few occasions but what infuses a vibrant energy into it is the rich set of interesting characters it packs in & a talented ensemble that brings those characters to life with finesse.<br/><br/>The boxing sequences are brilliantly choreographed and do provide the necessary adrenaline high when it matters but this picture is more focused on the relationship between the two brothers and illustrates it amazingly well, for those moments do pack a powerful punch. But it also suffers from letting it characters go a bit overboard at times, something that has become a norm in O. Russell's films of lately.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale & Melissa Leo, with Bale & Leo impressing the most. It's not that the input by leading cast falls short in any aspect, it's just that Bale & Leo take their supporting characters to a different level, and the Academy Award they won for their respective works in this feature film is definitely an earned one.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Fighter is no genre masterpiece but it still offers a sufficiently entertaining ride that will leave majority of its viewers satisfied in the end. It's not without its shortcomings but most of them get brushed away by the powerful, explosive & riveting performances delivered by its ensemble. The story isn't memorable by any means but what Bale & Leo pull off here will continue to reverberate for a few more years down the line."
"markymark70","8","3","3","14 February 2011"," The Fighter packs a hell of a punch...
","Ever since it was announced that Wahlberg was trying to get this film made - and that was a looooooong time ago at this stage - I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this film. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Not to re-hash the story too much but this is a real life story of Boston boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward and the struggles with his career, personal and family life in the mid-90s. Wahlberg is Micky Ward and Bale plays his crack addicted, squirrelly brother Dicky Eklund. <br/><br/>The style of the film is more realistic than the likes of 'Rocky', 'Raging Bull' and other fight films. It has some nice HBO TV style fight scenes which is shot is a clearer presentation akin to watching the bouts on prime-time television. But the meat of the story and the conflict is not in Micky's quest to achieve a world title - but in his ultimately uncomfortable relationship he has with his family. 7 girls, 2 boys, 2 fathers and 1 mother is a hell of a mix in a poor neighbourhood. Add to that Micky's mother is also his manager, his brother is his coach, his father also a coach and you see how complicated this could become. Micky is essentially the meal ticket for the entire clan.<br/><br/>Performances: Bale is terrific. If he doesn't get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year, then I'll eat my left shoe. (I might regret that last statement as Geoffrey Rush seems to be swooping that accolade for 'The King's Speech') But nonetheless - Bale deserves it. His portrayal of a crack addicted, might-have-been is spot on. Twitchy, wide-eyed, slurred but his stint in prison and the viewing of his so called 'comeback' documentary straightened him out and made him realise what is important. Family. His brother. <br/><br/>Adams is a ballsy character too - she has to be to survive in this environment. A strong woman who stands up for herself and her man against a formidable family group. I didn't know anything about Adams previous to this film but she seems to have that slightly grubby yet likable nature about her. <br/><br/>Leo as the mother/manager is a tough piece of work also. The family actually reminds me of so many families that I grew up with and in - that even though you know it is exaggerated on screen - there are many veins of truth running through it. <br/><br/>Lastly - but not least - Wahlberg himself. He has such a quiet way about him that even though he is a tough cookie, grew up in VERY similar circumstances to Ward and portrays a hardy boxer with a physique to match any professional - he remains an enigma. He comes across as a truly nice guy - both on screen and in real life. Even though he has had his brushes with the law (most famously his own stint in jail for a racist assault which resulted in his victim being left permanently blind in one eye), he really seems to have his life on track. Successful actor, producer, father and husband is a testament to his ability to stay the track. Here - his performance is an understated one but still packs a punch amidst the other more animated characters. He is the soul of the film both on the screen and in the background trying to get the thing made. None of the honours mention him but he knows deep down he has made something to be very proud of. Well done Marky Mark - you've come a long way from the Funky Bunch.<br/><br/>Overall - I'll score this 8/10. Some scenes a little slow to boil, some 'patchy' dialogue in places but overall it's heart is in the right place."
"tomgillespie2002","8","5","6","22 February 2011"," A pleasant surprise, with great performances all round
","Long in the development pipeline, and long something of a labour of love for actor Mark Wahlberg, The Fighter arrives just before Awards season, depicting a often-told story about overcoming obstacles to reach your dream. Wahlberg, who takes centre stage as Irish-American welterweight boxer Mickey Ward, spent four years bulking himself up for the part and learning to fight like a professional fighter. You have to admire his dedication, as his performance and the film itself is surprisingly excellent. After all, this story has already been told in the form of Rocky, although that was told with a more fairytale edge. The Fighter is grounded in a very miserable reality, where poverty and crack-addiction is rife.<br/><br/>Trained by his former-professional boxer half-brother Dickie (Christian Bale), Mickey is going from fight to fight making little money and usually getting his arse handed to him. He is what is known in the boxing world as a 'stepping stone' - someone to knock out the way just before your big shot. Things aren't helped by the fact that Dickie is an unreliable crack-head, and his manager mother, is selfish and only sees what would be beneficial to her family, rather than Mickey's career. Mickey O'Keefe, a policeman and Mickey's co-trainer, believes him to be a formidable fighter, trying to do the right thing while his family keep messing things up. When Dickie is arrested and is jailed for a long stint, Mickey quits boxing and shacks up with feisty bartender Charlene (Amy Adams), much to his mother's and his seven sister's dismay. When an opportunity presents itself, Mickey must decide what is right and consider stepping back into the ring and fulfil his potential.<br/><br/>So far, so cliché, you may think. And you would be right to think that too, as the film does tick all the boxes. Yet it has never been done with so much dedication and heart, and this pours onto the screen for us to see. It's a film of (excuse the pun) knockout (sorry!) performances by a highly talented cast. The critics have raved about him, yet the Awards panels have failed to recognise Mark Wahlberg's restrained performance as the shy, quiet Mickey. He holds the film together as it's a film that needs a central character that you can truly root for, and Wahlberg nails it. Perhaps because it is a less showy performance than the other actors, but Wahlberg can stand tall after this, capturing the standard of acting that we have seen previously in Boogie Nights and The Yards. It is Christian Bale, however, that is scooping up the awards, and has received an Oscar nomination for his painful depiction of drug- addled Dickie Eklund. It is a fine showcase for possibly the finest actor around at the moment, and you can only sit back in awe at his complete dedication to his craft. He apparently stayed in character throughout shooting, and he lost a lot of weight to portray the decimation of Dickie's addiction. Of course, he's done this before in The Machinist, but here his acting overshadows the physical attributes.<br/><br/>The downside to the film is it's clichés, but I was so completely engrossed in the story and the characters that I just didn't care. It is difficult for the sports genre as a whole, as their is always something that has been done before. The better sports films of the last few years - Friday Night Lights, Million Dollar Baby, The Wrestler - also had to sacrifice originality for the sake of telling a good story, and it's the same here. Kudos, though, for director David O. Russell (who directed the fantastic Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees - both containing great Wahlberg performances) who takes an unfussy, no-nonsense approach. During the dramatic scenes, he simply points the camera and allows his actors to act, and the story to be told. He changes this, however, during the slightly disappointing boxing scenes, which are clearly influenced by Scorsese's Raging Bull, but lacking the magic and artistic flair of the 1980 classic.<br/><br/>Although it's never going to win the Best Picture Oscar, it is a worthy contender, much like it's protagonist. I hope Bale will received the award he so thoroughly deserves, and Wahlberg will realise he's not an action star, but a very good actor. A very pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Based on the True story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), the Massachusetts born professional boxer.<br/><br/>David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" follows the story of a young man who grew up adoring his older half brother Dicky (Christian Bale) the hyperactive drug addicted professional boxer who once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in '78. To say Micky has a dysfunctional family would be an enormous understatement, with an overhaul of nicotine addicted controlling females led by the mother of the family, Alice (Melissa Leo) who believes she is managing his career but is blindly a burden on his professional & social life.<br/><br/>Micky encounters a heavily mismatched opponent organised by his family which was intended to be a morale boost leaves the hero of the film battered & embarrassed of his loss. His Life begins to change for the better when he begins to date Charlene (Amy Adams) a local barmaid popular with the men, who slowly opens his eyes that the problem with his life has been the influence of his family.<br/><br/>After a potentially career ending incident involving his brother/mentor Dicky, our central character with the forceful help of Charlene avoids his family and begins to train seriously with a fresh team of supporting staff; his father (Jack McGee), long-time trainer played by the real life Mickey O'Keefe & a new manager Sal (Frank Renzulli).<br/><br/>An extremely well re-created documentary of the original HBO feature titled ""High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell"" follows Dicky's long-time drug addiction to crack cocaine takes place during the film and is moving to watch.<br/><br/>There's an enormous amount of pressure on any Boxing based drama in cinema. With legendary classics Rocky (1975), Raging Bull (1980) or more recently Million Dollar Baby (2004), The Wrestler (2008) any film of this genre is going to be viewed with this comparison. The Fighter does extremely well to live up to it's predecessors on the screen.<br/><br/>Bale & Leo are flawless, arguably the finest we've seen them! Ever since the commitment Bale made to The Machinist (2004) dropping an excruciating 63Lbs for the role and then gaining it all back within weeks for the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins (2005) he confirmed to audiences that he is a true character actor and is dedicated to his art. Wahlberg is steady, ""The Fighter"" is an appropriate fit for his style of acting, recently he has made some poor career decisions he has admitted to himself; Max Payne (2008), The Happening (2008). At times he reminds his audience what he's capable of with quality performances such as I Heart Huckabees (2004), which was his 2nd collaboration with Director David O. Russell and most notably Scorsese's Best Picture Winner The Departed (2006) for which he earned his Academy Award Nomination.<br/><br/>In summary The Fighter has a lot to offer a wide variety of viewers and is well worth the line up & ticket price. 4 out of 5 Stars"

","This film is about a boxer who rises to stardom with the help of his half-brother, who is an ex-boxer that messes his career up by indulging in illicit drugs.<br/><br/>I was expecting something as emotionally gripping and touching as ""The Wrestler"", but ""The Fighter"" is nowhere near as good. ""The Fighter"" is so dialog heavy, and most of the time the dialog is just arguments or some unimportant nonsense. This constant babbling already put me off early into the film. The story itself is not engaging, the emotional highs and lows are not so pronounced. It just does not grip me and does not offer me an emotional ride. As a boxing film, ""The Fighter"" may work, but not as an Oscar worthy tearjerker."
"sddavis63","4","17","28","2 February 2011"," The Story Of Mickey Ward
","As any movie of this type has to do, it finally draws you into the protagonist's situation and gets you rooting for him. In this case the protagonist is real-life boxer Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who has to overcome big odds - not the least of which is an extremely dysfunctional family headed up by his controlling mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and his drug addict brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who used to be a boxer and who's claim to fame was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard (or did Sugar Ray slip?) and who now wants to live his dream through his brother. I appreciated the fact that Sugar Ray appeared as himself in a couple of brief scenes. By the time Mickey gets his title shot you are rooting for him, and you do admire his strength in overcoming the challenges he's faced. The actual title shot, mind you, struck me as a bit anti- climactic to be honest. It was pretty quickly portrayed and frankly the whole thing ultimately left me a bit empty, although I was satisfied to see Mickey become the champ.<br/><br/>For three-quarters of the movie, though, the focus is really on the dysfunctional family relationship, and the challenge presented to that relationship by the sudden appearance of Charlene (Amy Adams) - a local bartender and college dropout who hooks up with Mickey and pushes him to escape his family's controlling influence. This was a good performance from Adams. I found her the most interesting of the cast, because she was playing a character very different from the usual cute and sweet roles I've seen her in, and so she demonstrated a versatility I hadn't seen from her before. Wahlberg and Bale were all right, but I didn't find anything especially noteworthy about their performances.<br/><br/>In the end, the biggest weakness of this movie was that it really failed to draw me in until the title fight (and to an extent the fight that led up to the title fight.) I was bored frankly by the family, who struck me as a sort of Massachussetts version of ""white trash"" and who weren't really all that interesting. I can't imagine growing up with those sisters. Mickey deserves credit just for not punching any of them out. This really didn't do a great deal for me. It offers about half an hour that really intensely interested me, which fizzled out in a truly too abrupt ending and focused mostly on an unappealing family."

The performances that inspired and the ones that just couldn't keep up.<br/><br/>You see, my problem with the fighter is that there is no problem at all, I simply cannot think of anything bad about it, anything I would tweak, change or challenge...I think the fighter is a masterpiece and I have fallen completely and utterly in love with it.<br/><br/>This is a rarity for me, normally there is at least something in a movie, TV program or book that I just think could have been better, or that I think was not needed, but right now I am completely stumped.<br/><br/>I have to admit that before watching this film I had my reservations. I have never really liked boxing movies before. I never understood the hype over Rocky and Raging Bull. I was also unsure of the cast. On paper it looked like an excuse for Mark Wahlberg to be the tough guy, and what the hell was the chirpy girl from Enchanted doing in a heavy film like the fighter? The only thing I new with certainty was that Christian Bale would give a performance that I would love, simply because he always does. <br/><br/>I think one of the things that makes the fighter work so well is that it is not over ambitious, yes the movie is about a boxer but it is not about the sport itself, boxing is a supporting role to a story about family. It doesn't get lost in all the drama and violence of the sport but focus's on the personal life's of those involved. This is a refreshing change.<br/><br/>I can talk about this movie all day, I could talk about David O Russell's great directing, the exceptional script and great shooting work until I am blue in the face. But I only have a character limit of 1000 words, besides the thing that makes the fighter so good is the performances from its exceptional cast.<br/><br/>This is Mark Wahlbergs labour of love, the film he has been trying to make for years and he poured his heart and soul into his character Micky. His understated and underestimated performance in this film was unexpected. Micky is quiet and peaceful, even when the world is erupting around him and his family are making life unbearable he still manages to keep his cool and deal with the punches as they come. Did he deserve an Oscar nomination for this performance? Probably yes, yet I am not surprised that he didn't. His performance and his characters quietness is simply overwhelmed by the loud, proud and damn craziness of the supporting cast and characters.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, in this movie, is a revelation. I would go as far to say that it is one of the best performances I have ever seen from an actor. Yet again he dropped weight for this role, and yet again he has been criticized. The criticism is uncalled for and unfair, he is playing a former welterweight boxer who is addicted to crack, show me one of those who are not skinny to the bone. He pretty much steals the show here and has proved to many that he really is one of the actors of our generation.<br/><br/>It is not only Bale who impresses in this movie, Melissa Leo who plays Micky and Dicky's mother is fierce and loyal. She is aggressive in her love for her children, and I pray for anyone that ever gets in her way. Leo's performance is worthy of her Oscar nomination, she is tough and edgy, a woman struggling to hold everything together when in reality everything is falling apart. Amy Adams who plays Micky's girlfriend Charlene is also brilliant, she is as tough as Leo and provides a lot of the humour with her bad ass attitude and fierce loyalty for Micky.<br/><br/>The fighter is without doubt one of the films of the year and maybe even the best boxing movie to come out of Hollywood. It feels real and the performances are some of the best I have seen. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.<br/><br/>And, if Christian Bale does not come out of this with an Oscar I shall ignore the academy awards for the rest of my existence."
"galahad58-1","6","20","38","31 December 2010"," Not a Rocky, Million Dollar Baby or a Cinderella Man--just foul mouthed
","There have been so many good boxing movies over the years: Raging Bull and Rocky set the bar extremely high for boxing movies; On the Waterfront showed a great portrayal of a failed boxer dealing with life; Million Dollar Baby was a spectacular look at the relationship between boxer and trainer; Cinderella Man was a perfect example of the comeback; Somebody Up There Likes Me was a nice movie; The Boxer (Daniel Day Lewis) was a great film about overcoming the odds; Hard Times (Charles Bronson) was a terrific film about bare fisted boxing.<br/><br/>The Fighter was not comparable to the aforementioned movies in many ways: there was no character development whatsoever -- so you do not feel the joy of a Rocky winning or the pain of Maggie Fitzgerald breaking her neck -- you feel nothing at the end. The script was laced with profanity -- way too much profanity -- you feel like you are the one being punched in the face with all the foul language. I do not think there is a single line that does not have the F-bomb (or an equivalent vileness) spouted from any of the characters. The movie plays like a foul-mouthed Jerry Springer episode and looks like it was made for today's vile, uneducated, ignorant generation.<br/><br/>I admire that the ""real"" Mickey fought against the odds and won a title and I admire that the ""real"" Dicky cleaned his life up and went on to help his brother in his time of need. I do not think the movie's portrayal of the characters did much to emphasize what could have been a good movie about comebacks and life changes.<br/><br/>Not Rocky--not Raging Bull--nowhere near Million Dollar Baby or Cinderella Man--wait for it on video."
"zkonedog","10","5","7","10 March 2017"," Why Are Boxing Movies Never Really About Boxing?!
","For whatever reason, considering the low real-world current popularity of the sport, boxing fares quite well at the cinema (think Rocky, The Champ, & Million Dollar Baby to name a few). That tradition continues with ""The Fighter"", a film that delves into so many more themes than just the sweet science.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Fighter"" tells the dual stories of brothers Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and Dickie Ecklund (Christian Bale). Coming from a family of almost total dysfunction and seemingly headed for a life of manual labor, the boxing brothers each face their own inner demons as Mickey takes his ""last shot"" at pugilistic success.<br/><br/>What really makes this a spectacular movie is the incredible complexity of the characters. Nothing is black-and-white about the entire experience, with all the plots/characters providing ample opportunities for shades of grey (the sign of most truly great movies). Nothing is predictable whatsoever, with the character dynamics changing regularly as the situations dictate. From beginning to end, the intense emotional roller-coaster will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Of course, what makes those emotions really ""pop"" are the incredible acting performances. Bale nearly steals the entire show as the enigmatic Dickie, cementing himself as perhaps the greatest pure actor of the present day. Wahlberg also nails the emotionally-drained Ward as he tries to navigate the pathetic petty family drama. Finally, Amy Adams (playing Charlene, Mickey's girlfriend) shows her acting chops as the fulcrum point from which Mickey goes from ""hanger- on"" to ""legitimate contender"".<br/><br/>The directing is adept as well, considering that no scene or character is wasted. Every single frame and interaction is meaningful in the overall scheme of things.<br/><br/>Thus, I consider ""The Fighter"" to be one of the greatest sports films of all-time. Everything (from acting to plot to direction) is solid and no time is wasted in the hour and fifty minute runtime. I could have watched two MORE hours and not have been bored in the slightest."
"blackburnj-1","6","5","7","9 February 2011"," The high quality of the acting belies The Fighter's ordinariness
","[3 Stars] ""The Fighter"" arrived on these shores adorned with nominations and plaudits aplenty. Some went so far as to say that the film was ""the best boxing film since Rocky"", Esquire magazine having apparently missed ""Raging Bull"" altogether. It is a shame, therefore, that the actual film should be so thoroughly ordinary.<br/><br/>It is not a bad film at all. It is solid, pretty watchable, pretty interesting fare. The true story of Micky Ward's rise in boxing is one of those stories which sport throws up that seems born for Hollywood. But, Hollywood this is. The film is clichéd and predictable. It says very little but portrays a story of hard circumstances overcome in a manner which is more populist than the film's box office would suggest, the film's harder side counting against it there.<br/><br/>It is however nothing extraordinary. David O. Russell certainly brings an ounce of originality with the frenetic style of the film – fast moving cameras, numerous cuts, characters jabbering over each other on and off screen – but none of this makes the film more gripping or appears to serve any real purpose. It jogs along following the expected path – solid, good, occasionally funny, and unremarkable. The victories do not seem to matter as much as they should. The trials and lows of the film are not very affecting. Nothing stands out.<br/><br/>That is with the exception of the acting, which is fantastic. Christian Bale has received all of the nominations for his bold and flashy performance as Micky Ward's crack-addict brother, Dicky Ecklund, and rightly so. After the disappointment of his dull turn in ""Public Enemies"", this is Bale back on form. However, as he acknowledged when accepting his Golden Globe, he wouldn't have got away with it without the sterling work from Mark Wahlberg, whose understated central turn is lead-acting at its best. He is always interesting, always gripping and gives the film its drive. He makes it watchable.<br/><br/>In the supporting roles, there is seemingly a great battle going on between Amy Adams and Melissa Leo for the supporting actress gongs this year, and rightly so. Adams continues to establish herself as an extremely versatile and effective young actress with a great future ahead of her. However, it is Leo who should triumph for her barnstorming performance of the battle-axe mother of the two brothers. She is absolutely brutal on screen and entertaining. Though her character as written is slightly monotonous, she manages to disguise this very adroitly.<br/><br/>However, the film leaves its audience impressed by the quality of the acting but unimpressed by the film as a whole. Frankly, there are better ways to spend seven or eight pounds. Get ""Raging Bull"" out on DVD, or organise a whip-round so that Esquire can watch ""Raging Bull"". As for ""The Fighter"", it shall dimly fade, but the performances will remain as fine examples of the actor's craft."
"howard.schumann","8","5","7","18 December 2010"," Never had much invested in the outcome
","David O. Russell's The Fighter is about Mickey Ward, a personality-free junior welterweight fighter (Mark Wahlberg) the working class town of Lowell, Massachusetts whose struggles are as much outside of the ring as inside. Based on a true story, the film revolves around Mick's s relationship with his dysfunctional family that includes his half-brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), an ex-fighter called ""The Pride of Lowell"" because he survived ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard, his overbearing trash-talking mother, Alice (Melissa Leo) and his repellent seven sisters who are little more than caricatures. Mick worships Dickie who insists he once floored Sugar Ray Leonard, but Dickie has become a crack addict who is unfit for the ring except to act as his brother's trainer.<br/><br/>A wiry, hyper-active individual, a role at times overplayed by Bale, Dickie is interviewed by HBO who Dickie thinks they are filming a documentary on his boxing career only to find out that it is really a documentary about crack addiction in Lowell. When Mick is thrown into the ring with a fighter who weighs twenty pounds more than him and is beaten to little short of a pulp, Mick begins to open his eyes to the fact that his career is being mishandled. The issue becomes further crystallized when he meets Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a former college student who works as a bar girl, who tells him that he should accept a promoter's offer to train in Las Vegas, away from the influence of his unstable family.<br/><br/>Charlene is a tough cookie with a good sense of humor and doesn't back down easily. Her resolve is tested, however, when she has to confront Mick's mother and his seven sisters who hold her opinion in little regard. With Dickie serving a prison term for impersonating a police officer, Mick's turnaround in the ring begins when he hires a local cop to be his manager, leading him to a string of victories and an upcoming title fight in London, England, the emotional high point of the film. The push and pull continues with Dickie, however, when he is released from prison and wants to resume his role as Mick's trainer. Mick's fight is as much for his manhood as it is for control of his career, but the issue is never satisfactorily resolved.<br/><br/>The fights are orchestrated for maximum audience involvement. Somewhat akin to Ali's ""rope-a-dope"", Mick is repeatedly pummeled in the early rounds of his fights but comes to life when it seems he is done for. Though this is an unlikely scenario, Russell makes it believable and, at times exciting. Mick, however, is a reluctant warrior who seems strangely out of place in a boxing ring. Comparisons have been made between Rocky (1976) and The Fighter. Rocky was also a gritty boxing movie about an underdog from the wrong side of the tracks who overcomes great odds to become a champion. Rocky Balboa, however, had heart and soul and inspired people to root for him and the film made you feel better about yourself. Though there is some fine acting in The Fighter, especially by Amy Adams, unlike Rocky, we never have much invested in the outcome."

"Likes_Ninjas90","8","2","2","13 February 2011"," Like many of the classic boxing pictures, there are more significant and interesting things happening outside of the ring
","This is based on the true story of boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and his half brother Dicky (Christian Bale), a junkie. They live in working class Lowell, Massachusetts, where everyone is aware of Micky's poor results. Micky is managed by Dicky and his eccentric mother Alice (Melissa Leo). Dickie is deluded by the idea that he himself is going to make a comeback and that the camera crew following him are going to make a movie about his life. Frustratingly for Micky, he has not been winning many of his fights as the opponents organised by Dicky are regularly superior. Further dominating Micky's life are his six sisters, who move together in a pack. The family ties are disrupted when Micky becomes involved with the barmaid Charlene (Amy Adams), a girl who the sisters do not trust at all. When Dicky is arrested and put in gaol Micky is given an offer by a more professional manager, who says he does not want Dicky around as he is too much trouble. Micky must decide whether he is going to turn his back on his brother who has trained him and provided him with regular knowledge. <br/><br/>It took me a long time to warm to Christian Bale's performance in The Fighter. He's so extreme as Dickie, having slimmed down significantly and possessing such highly wired body language. It initially seems like a caricature of a junkie. But David O. Russell's film is too smart to fall into simplicity. As the story develops, Bale's multilayered performance works to accentuate the soul of the film: pride. Dickie's showiness and exaggeration is deliberate. He's playing up to the cameras in the film, thinking they're making a movie about his life. But as he becomes aware of the reality and the shame that he has brought on himself and most significantly his young son, his star fades. Bale touchingly infuses his character with a vulnerable consciousness. O. Russell skilfully draws this notion of pride from the other performances too. Tension is built from the decay of the family structure. We learn that Alice has been preparing both of her sons to be boxers since they were small children and thus she is not a caricature either. She's extremely possessive but her position as both a mother and a manager is understandable. The best scenes in the film, some of the funniest too, are shared with Alice and the six sisters. They work extremely well to accentuate the themes of family and pride and how significant these values are in a working class town. Out of all the characters however, Adams is the standout. After playing a nun in Doubt she transforms herself seamlessly into a foul mouthed, hardened barmaid. What we don't know about her interests us the most. We know that she dropped out of college so is she using Mickey as an opportunity for herself? Does she have a right to interfere with such a tightly knit family? Some have felt that against these powerful performances Wahlberg is the weak link. I admired the restraint of his quiet performance. It works to show how controlling and dominant the rest of his family is around him. Largely, he's very contained. Most surprising is how very little boxing there is in the film. But like many of the classic boxing pictures, there are more significant and interesting things happening outside of the ring."
"estebangonzalez10","8","2","2","8 February 2011"," Who is The Fighter? Mark Wahlberg or Christian Bale?
","¨I'm the one who's fighting. Not you, not you, and not you.¨<br/><br/>It's a good thing Mark Wahlberg's character reminds us about this near the end of the film because you could think that he wasn't the central theme of David O. Russell's movie due to the fact that the rest of the performances from the ensemble cast outshine him. Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams give such great performances that Wahlberg's character gets kind of lost in the midst of the story, but I don't think that's a negative critique for the film because it kind of summarizes the way his character has felt his entire life. Sidelined by his mother and seven sisters who have always shown preference toward his older half-brother (played by Christian Bale), who is sort of the local hero of a small town in Massachusetts called Lowell. Russell, who hadn't directed a film in 6 years (I Heart Huckabees), does a great job with the direction of this film thanks to a powerful script written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson. It is based on a true story, but of course has probably been modified by Hollywood for more dramatic effects. It follows the boxing career of ¨Irish¨ Micky Ward and his rise to the top against all odds. The plot may sound familiar and sort of follows the same premise every other sport movie does, however the performance from the ensemble cast makes this movie stand out from the rest. It also has a powerful screenplay and focuses on Ward's family as much as it does with his boxing career so it makes for a good balanced dramatic sports film.<br/><br/>The movie takes place during the 90's in Lowell, Massachusetts and opens with an HBO interview of Dicky Ecklund (Christian Bale), a former boxer known as ¨the pride of Lowell¨ who once knocked down the great Sugar Ray Leonard. He lost the fight, but survived all ten rounds in the ring with him. He is a retired boxer who is now training his younger half brother, Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) along with their mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), who is his manager. Dicky's convinced that HBO is making a documentary about his comeback, but the truth of the matter is that it's about crack addiction and how it can destroy people's lives. Dicky is in his 40's and consumed by his drug addiction. He spends most of his days locked up in a friend's house getting high or in prison, although he still doesn't seem to acknowledge the fact that it's slowly ruining his life. His entire family knows about his addiction, but can't seem to help him with it. Just like the rest of the people in Lowell, Micky admires his brother and listens to everything he has to say about boxing. Micky sometimes waits hours in the gym for his brother to show up and help him train, but his addiction and time in prison is hurting Micky's career as well. His mother doesn't help him very much as his manager either as she sometime pins him up in fights against boxers who are twenty pounds heavier than him. Micky is about to give up on his career until he meets Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a sexy bartender who teaches him to stand up against his family and not give up on his dream. When Dicky is sentenced to 15 years in prison it is time for Micky to find a new trainer and fulfill his dream.<br/><br/>Russell's picture received 7 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director. It had been a long time since his latest film (six years) and the wait was worth the while. His most acclaimed film up to this point had been Three Kings (in which he also worked with Wahlberg), but I have a feeling most people will remember him for this movie now on. The Fighter is a good film. It is more than just another boxing movie; it's a film about family and rising to the challenge. The film is so well balanced mixing boxing and family drama that I don't know if the title is referring to Wahlberg's character as a boxer, or Bale's character as a drug addict. Both of them have to fight extremely difficult odds in order to survive (Micky as a boxer and Dicky as a free junkie). The family also has to go through difficult times in order to survive, but somehow they manage to stick together despite all the differences. Christian Bale is truly the star of this film. He is so energetic and loud, that one wouldn't recognize this guy as being Batman or Sean Connor from the Terminator. The physical and emotional transformation he goes through in this film is just impressive. Melisa Leo (Frozen River) is also excellent in her role as Alice, as well as Amy Adams who also plays a different role in this film from what she has us used too. All three actors have been nominated for the Oscars, and Bale is a favorite to win. Wahlberg, as I said, sort of gets sidelined by the rest of the cast, but his performance is strong and powerful nonetheless. The Fighter isn't among my top ten films of the year, but it still is a very well balanced sports drama which I strongly recommend.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"dancer-91","8","2","2","6 February 2011"," Another great movie
","The Fighter tells the story Mickey Ward, the fighter that was almost overshadowed by his brother with a drug addiction.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg has never been better. He has done a few really good roles (The Departed) and a few bad ones (Max Payne) but this is what he was born to play. He's perfect as Mickey, he's masculine enough to play a fighter and a man enough to do a part like this.<br/><br/>But for Wahlberg's bad luck, Christian Bale almost leaves him in his shadow, like his character Dickey almost leaves Mickey in his shadow. Bale is sick and disgusting as the former-boxer-now-turned-into-a-drug-addict. You really hate him and then you love him because he's that good in the part.<br/><br/>And the ladies don't disappoint either. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo deliver great performances as the girl from the bar and as the mother.<br/><br/>The movie is amazing and full of great performances, but it isn't a perfect movie. I found it irritating that almost 2/3 of the film is about Dickey and Mickey's relationship to him and the the last part is about Mickey and the fighting and it's over before you know it. And where is Wahlberg's Oscar Nomination?!! But in all, a great film. Worth watching and the actors are fantastic. Good film, not great"
"freemantle_uk","8","2","2","2 February 2011"," A fine boxing film
","When the script for The Fighter ended up reaching Mark Walhberg he was demanded to make it, going through a long pre-production before it was finally made.<br/><br/>The Fighter is the story of Micky Ward (Wahlberg), a 30-year-old welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. He is trained by his brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) and his mum, Alice (Melissa Leo) is his manager. Micky is a boxer who never fulfilled his potential and his family have dominated his career. Dicky is also a crack addict and been followed by a documentary crew. The whole family live in the past because of Dicky's greatest achievement was knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. After Micky was forced into a fight against a much heavier boxer he is ready to quit, especially after Dicky is arrested and the police breaks his hand. But after Micky meets a barmaid, Charlene (Amy Adams) and with the support of her and his dad (Jack McGee), Micky sets about having a comeback with his brother and mother and has a shot at being the World Title. Whilst in prison Dickey attempts to come clean and get himself back into shape.<br/><br/>Originally Darren Aronofsky was set to direct The Fighter but in the end left so he could do Black Swan: so David O. Russell stepped in. Russell did attempt to follow some of Aronofsky's style, using hand-held cameras and looking at live in a working class urban setting, but he uses a lighter colour pallet and injects a bit of humour into the story. Moments of comedy particularly involving Micky's sisters, the next being even more ugly then last and when Dicky tries to escape his mother by jumping out a window. This is a film about family loyalty and how it could have a destructive affect, that if someone tries to do something for himself and gets advise outside the family that it is seen as an act of betrayal. Its almost like the Mitchell family in Eastenders, where every action has to done with the rest family in mind. But it shows that family does not always knows best. It is also an examination of inner city live in a run down city and general working class culture where boxing is a popular sport. It is an area that is ignored by people, where people turn to vices ranging from drink to drugs.<br/><br/>Acting wise this was Wahlberg's dream project, but the problem is that Micky Ward is very passive character. He is a man who just gives in to his family or needs advice, he does not do any action for himself. It makes him a weak-willed hero. Wahlberg gives Micky a quiet personality and does look the part. But it is the supporting characters that are more interesting roles and do more in the way of action. Christian Bale throws his all into his role, making out that Dicky could be a joker and someone who did love his brother, but someone who could not be trusted and simply lives on past glories. He is a man who has to face up to his demons and move on with his live. Adams's character is a feisty being, someone who does not take stick from anyone. She is a tough, edgy working class woman but also fun to see in her bra and panty. Leo's character is very much a matriarch, the head of the family who loves her children but things she knows best when really she does not. She rules with almost an iron fist and it is either her way or no way. She unfairly favours Dicky despite what he does and over looks Micky's wishes and achievements. The problem is Micky disappears on screen when all these other characters are on screen and Wahlberg should had made his character stronger.<br/><br/>When it comes the fighting screens they are well handled by Russell and he shots all the ring action like it was done by television crew. It is a bit different and allows you to see all the action. It also focuses all the action on the ring and the fight crew, with the crowd plunged in darkness.<br/><br/>A criticism I have of the film is way the England was portrayed, with English people portrayed in the most stereotypical way possible. I haven't seen any English people dressed in old-fashion bowties and it would even less like that boxing officials would look like that. The man who plays Shea Neary, Anthony Molinari is meant to be a Liverpoolian but his accent sounds like a weird cross between Scottish and Australian. His characterisation was also handled in a clichéd way, a complete bastard: this was done in many of the Rocky films and Cinderella Man with the idea of making you want to route for Ward. But we do not get to see much of Neary anyway and surely wouldn't it be more realistic that he said something like I am here to win without bad mouthing his opponent. It certainly would be different. Rant over, The Fighter is at times a little slow and does have a few too many montages, but it still an enjoyable film, particularly to anyone who likes boxing."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","2","2","27 January 2011"," A trio of standout performances in this satisfying sports flick
","David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" recounts the early years of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. His half-brother, former boxer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), taught him everything he knows but his drug addiction is becoming a frequent distraction. Ward also has to contend with the influence of his hard-bitten mother/manager, Alice (Melissa Leo).<br/><br/>The film takes a few liberties with the truth in the name of dramatic license but the story is reasonably accurate for a Hollywood biopic. Anybody familiar with the real-life boxer will know how this all turns out but we end up becoming involved in the stories of the other characters as well, particularly Dicky Eklund.<br/><br/>The screenplay ends up being an entertaining mix of sports film and character-driven drama. Eklund's drug problems and the family's conflicts make for some intriguing situations that add some gravity to what is, at heart, a conventional sports story. Bringing it all together is director David O. Russell, who garnered an Oscar nomination in the process. The film looks and sounds terrific, with authentic visuals and a tuneful soundtrack.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, though, the film's main strength comes in the form of the performances by Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale & Melissa Leo. The latter two individuals recently experienced well-deserved Golden Globe wins while Wahlberg had to settle for a nomination. Bale & Leo stand a pretty good chance of repeating at the Oscars but Wahlberg was unaccountably snubbed by the academy. Amy Adams has also been getting attention for her performance but I think she's a (small) step down from the others.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Fighter"" hits the right notes for a successful sports flick while also managing to squeeze in some compelling drama. Bale's performance is one of his best ever and Wahlberg deserves praise as well. Even though it may be a bit too close to sports film convention to be considered great this film is nevertheless well worth your time."
"jtmytake3","8","2","2","24 January 2011"," David O Russell and Mark Wahlberg's gritty story of boxer Micky Ward
","The Fighter which is based on a true story of 'Irish' Micky Ward (Wahlberg) a boxer who came to notoriety in the late 80's after being trained by his older brother local legend Dickie Eklund (played superbly by Bale) who's claim to fame was a title fight with Sugar Ray Robinson. The story is set in gritty working class Lowell, Massachusetts and depicts the tale of Micky Ward a could of been, almost has been boxer who is trying to break into the higher echelons of the boxing world with the help of his trainer and half brother Dickie Eklund and his mother and manager Alice Eklund (Melissa Leo).<br/><br/>Unfortunately after his latest mismatch with a recently released prison inmate and a run in with the local law enforcement trying to save his brother from a beating at their hands Micky's right hand is broken and he is all set to give up on his dream. However after his brother is incarcerated for several criminal offences which include impersonating a police officer, Micky temporarily breaks ties with his family in order to gain another stab at his boxing dream without the help of his interfering mother and crack addicted brother. He manages to gain respect in the boxing world and is soon given the opportunity for a title bout after beating the number one contender.<br/><br/>This is a really deft piece from David O. Russell (Three Kings) and it is in no small part down to the driving force of Mr Wahlberg who has been trying to get this movie made for about six years and serves as producer. Wahlberg trained with some of the best in the business including legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao and this shows in the boxing scenes which are strikingly realistic with Walhberg trading real blows to add authenticity to this piece. Wahlberg gives a solid performance as the would be champion whose dogged determination is akin to Walhlberg's desire to bring this story to the silver screen. The supporting cast are excellent with stand out performances from Amy Adams as Micky's devoted girlfriend and Leo as the loving and controlling mother. However it is Bale who really shines in his role as the crack addicted has been legend who grasps on to an almost forgotten past with both hands. His gritty portrayal of this down trodden character is the surprise of this movie especially as he came into the role after Brad Pitt and Matt Damon both had to turn down the role. I wouldn't be to surprised if he gets a nod in the supporting actor category with the oncoming award season upon us. The Fighter is a compelling Rockyesque story of a man who fights against the machinations of his own tawdry existence just as hard as he has to fight his opponents in the ring....true irony!!"
"moviexclusive","9","2","2","5 January 2011"," Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale give two of the best performances you'll see this year- and thanks to them, this boxing drama is deeply poignant and stirring
","""Irish"" Micky Ward was the born-and-bred boxer from the working-class Massachusetts city of Lowell who fought his way to an unlikely world championship in the year 2000. Mark Wahlberg's passion project ""The Fighter"" traces the rise of Micky from no more than a ""stepping stone"" (i.e. someone you fight with just to rise up the ranks) to his sweet victory as junior welterweight world champion. As far as boxing dramas go, this tale of an underdog who battles the odds to accomplish a shot at the big time may seem familiar, but David O'Russell's film proves that there is still plenty of punch in the genre. <br/><br/>Russell is acutely aware that the best boxing dramas don't keep their combats confined in the ring; rather, that ringside victory is but only a metaphor of the boxer's triumph over adversity in his/her own life, and the genuine payoff for an audience emotionally vested in the character's personal struggles. So in addition to being a rousing boxing drama, this is also a psychologically complex family drama, a sweet and poignant love story, and most of all, a complicated tale of two brothers. Russell's greatest accomplishment? Weaving together all these disparate elements together into a knockout of a film. <br/><br/>When we first meet Micky, he has just lost three fights in a row, and though his older half-brother and trainer Dicky Ecklund- whose moment of glory was once knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard- assures him that his time to shine is coming, a mismatched bout with a fighter 20 pounds heavier than him knocks out his fight. Luckily for him, a sexy and spunky bargirl, Charlene (Amy Adams), sashays into his life and helps him find the courage to accomplish his dream and remove the familial obstacles standing in his way. <br/><br/>Russell's film thrives on these complex and thorny family dynamics- Micky's family see him as their last bastion of hope to earn some boxing cash, in particular his chain-smoking gin-drinking mom and manager Alice (Melissa Leo), whose distrust of outsiders including Charlene is as ferocious as her denial of her jewel-in-the-eye Dicky's crack addiction. Adding to the dysfunctional working-class family are seven loud and virulent sisters all stoically inclined towards Alice's opinions, amidst their cackle not one voice of reason. The verbal showdown between Charlene and Micky's exploitative female family for Micky's future is one of the beautifully staged sequences in the film, and Micky's difficult decision to free himself from their suffocating choke around his life is one of the many poignant moments here. <br/><br/>But the heart of the story is still the fraternal relationship between Dicky and Micky, one the star of the family basking in his past glory and the other the wannabe-boxer living in his brother's shadow. Their subsequent emotional tug-of-war as Micky is forced to choose to do what's right by himself is heartrending in its brutal honesty, culminating in Micky's avowal to abandon Dicky as his trainer. Russell spends the first half emphasising the close bond between the two brothers, such that their separation and eventual reunion are easily the most affecting elements of the film. <br/><br/>Against these troubled sentiments portrayed with a keenly felt rawness, Micky's relationship with the smart and tough Charlene who fights fearlessly against his family for his interests is a perfect counterbalance, and thanks to a terrific performance by Amy Adams, ends up tender and moving. Kudos to Adams for going beyond her usual perky type (e.g. ""Enchanted"" or ""Julie and Julia"") to play Micky's feisty other half with a will of steel- her unaffected performance will win you over right from the start. <br/><br/>That Adams' stellar achievement in her supporting role may be so conveniently overlooked is testament to the quality of the acting on display in this film, which can be summed up in one word- phenomenal. In particular, you'll be astounded by perhaps Christian Bale's best performance to date, an exceptional accomplishment from one of the greatest character actors of our time. Bale dropped thirty pounds to play the skinny, fidgety older brother complete with receding hairline, bald spot and crack-addict teeth. It's easy to cast Dicky as the bad guy in the story, but Bale imbues him with such warmth and sensitivity that you can't help but feel immensely for his character. Bale keeps up a nervous energy about Dicky in every frame, and it is simply mesmerising to watch. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Wahlberg has the less showy role as Micky, and though Dicky pretty much steals the first half of the movie, Russell makes it plainly clear by the second half that we- like Dicky's family- have very much been distracted by his antics. Micky is no less than the very core of the movie- it is his fighting spirit that eventually reunites the family. So while Wahlberg's performance may be low-key, it is still outstanding and counts among one of his best ever. Wahlberg's dedication to his craft is even more admirable considering how the actor started preparing for this role five years ago, building a boxing ring in his backyard, hiring two trainers on his own dime, and training hours each day to hone his skills. <br/><br/>Beyond preparing for the role, Wahlberg's contribution to this film goes even further- when Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and subsequently Darren Aronofsky dropped out, it was Wahlberg who shaped the project from a studio film to a US$25m indie and got director David O'Russell on board. His efforts have paid off tremendously- Russell has created one of the best boxing dramas to date, a film that belongs in the league of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". So much more than an underdog tale, this is a complex study of familial ties, the ones that strengthen and the ones that strangle. And thanks to astounding turns by Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, this ""Fighter"" is simply one of the best films of the year."
"bobbobwhite","8","2","2","23 December 2010"," Christian Bale owns this film
","Bale gave one of the great performances in modern film in his role as Dicky Ecklund, former contender for a world boxing title, and brother of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, the subject of this film's story. Bale was so great and Oscar-worthy in his role it is hard to believe he was not a boxer at some time in his life, as he had all the tics, moves and brain-damaged mannerisms down solid. Mark Wahlburg was quiet and competent as Ward, as he typically plays all of his roles, but the real acting kudos go to Bale, Melissa Leo as the mother of Ward and Ecklund and their seven blowsy sisters(!), and to Amy Adams as Ward's gorgeous but tough-as-nails, bartender girlfriend who supported and protected him against the specious love of his mother and brother who took every parasitic advantage of Ward to pursue their own wants at his expense. Coarse and ignorant ethnic mannerisms, speech patterns, and social behavior of that clannish Irish ghetto were so spot-on one could imagine all of the cast living their entire lives before this film in that poor, decrepit and decaying factory-town part of Lowell, Mass. They were that good.<br/><br/>The story of the rise, fall, and rise again of Ward's boxing career was a good and involving one, made so much better due to the intertwined story of Ecklund's former boxing glory shown in stark contrast to his later life of a crack addicted, criminal loser whose job was to train his brother to be a world boxing champ but most often got derailed by his bad habit and truly pathetic friends. <br/><br/>The harsh but loving family interplay of this big and rowdy group was the best thing in the story, as all the behavioral things that keep poor people down were shown so well here.......irresponsibility, ignorance, temper, addictions, clannishness, and a skewed view of reality and right and wrong and how to deal with all of it. A real lesson was shown in how to screw up your life, but also shown for balance was how to improve it through hard work and the love and concern of those who truly care. This outrageous family really cared for each other, hard as it was sometimes to believe, and it proved out in the end.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year and a true labor of love for Wahlberg, who tried for many years to get it made and finally did so in triumphant fashion. A real winner for him and for us."
"mistarkus","9","2","2","22 December 2010"," More character than boxing
","More so than boxing it's about characters and choices. <br/><br/>Choosing which people to listen to and retain in one's life is a theme we can all relate to. And even more than boxing this movie concerns itself with the people Micky Ward chooses to have in his corner both in the ring and in life. <br/><br/>The seemingly selfish and misguided mother and the eccentric, loony brother control Micky's destiny perhaps devastating his potential to become a great boxer. A girl comes into Micky's life who helps Micky achieve clarity and provide him with womanly support. The ultimate choice Micky makes is not predictable and that sets it apart from the clichéd predictability of boxing movies.<br/><br/>There are two character studies and as much as the movie is about Micky it is also about his brother Dicky played by Bale. The over the top, loony, egotistical, wired Dicky plays an amusing, odd-couply contrast to the mild mannered, unassuming solid Micky. He too must make a climatic decision in the movie with regards to his life and his vulnerability with drugs. These two characters play off each other as can be imagined of fighter brothers with such drastically different personalities. Despite the obvious confrontations, their hearts for each other are warmly felt. <br/><br/>What makes this a very good movie is that you really care about the characters. Good acting from Amy Adam's loving womanliness, to Bale's charming goofiness, to Walberg's unassuming soft-spoken way create characters that represent a common Americana. The familiarity felt from these people blended with the all American setting of Lowell Mass, with its array of down-home individuals, provide us with characters that are so endearing that we can't help but to effortlessly empathize with them."
"colinrgeorge","8","2","2","20 December 2010"," A Fighting Chance
","It's easy to take a film like David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" for granted around award season. It's minus the panache of the year's other heavy hitters, and fills a comfortable 'sports drama' niche. O. Russell's film may very well be among the ten best picture nominations announced next month, but it doesn't have a shot at the title—which is a shame, because it earns greatness in its own right.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" isn't the best film of the year, but it features some of the best characters and performances of the year, wrapped in a familiar but accessible underdog story with plenty of fresh hooks. Much attention has been paid to Christian Bale as boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward's crack-addicted brother, and rightly so. Even among so talented an ensemble, Bale shines in his transformative turn, once again whittling himself down to little more than a human wireframe.<br/><br/>Bale probably receives too much credit for his wild weight swings, which have the tendency to upstage merely passable performances, but his talent as showcased in ""The Fighter"" is incontrovertible. This is best Bale has ever been, juggling pathos with a sense of humor I presumed lost after ""American Psycho."" If ""The Fighter"" takes home one award, it'll have Christian Bale's name on it.<br/><br/>Bale is so vibrant in his role that it's easy to forget to mention the strength of the rest of the cast; Mark Wahlberg contributes his best performance in years under O. Russell, whom he's collaborated with before on ""Three Kings"" and ""I Heart Huckabees."" As an artist, Wahlberg may be guilty of poor taste more than anything else, as he has consistently proved more than capable a performer in the right hands. The same boyish naivety that made him a perfect fit for P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" shines through in ""The Fighter,"" which along with his physical formidability make him both believable and easy to get behind.<br/><br/>If I have a gripe about the casting, Amy Adams might actually be a bit too attractive as Ward's love interest—a small town bartender and college dropout—but her performance sells it. Also fine are Ward's destructive family, including Melissa Leo as the totalitarian matriarch, who's followed in tow by a gaggle of her fiercely protective daughters, and Jack McGee as the working-class dad who seems consistently out of his element among all the aggressive estrogen.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is a terrifically acted film, but its real strength comes from the way its characters drive the story. Much of the drama comes from Ward's poisonous relationship with his mother and brother (his manager and trainer, respectively), and his having to break free of their manipulation and neglect is a decidedly unorthodox angle for a sports flick. Those relationships motivate the narrative, and the result is a drama that runs like clockwork. ""The Fighter"" is engrossing, unpretentious, and an immaculate crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>O. Russell and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (""Let the Right One In"") deserve recognition as well for giving the film its distinctive visual flair. Of particular interest is the style and method by which the pair chose to shoot their fight sequences, which achieve some of the best faux-broadcast mimicry I've ever seen. The effect is initially so convincing that I assumed actual footage had been integrated from Ward's fights—until Wahlberg stepped into the ring. From there, the camera-work is kept tight and effect is satisfying and visceral.<br/><br/>Buzz films like ""Black Swan"" and ""127 Hours"" will likely dominate much of the awards dialogue in the coming months, but ""The Fighter"" deserves a fair shake as well. Unlike last year's condescending ""Blindside,"" David O. Russell's sports drama isn't exploitative, nor is it only receiving praise in the context of its Oscar-caliber performances. ""The Fighter"" is absolutely worth seeing, and not just for Christian Bale. It could be a contender."
"kindigth","Null","2","2","19 December 2010"," The Fighter
","The Fighter is quite good. There aren't all that many surprises here, and those of us who ♥ed David O. Russel's out-there Huckabees will be a little disappointed by its safeness, but it is definitely good. Quite good, even.<br/><br/>The film's obvious standout is Christian Bale as Dicky, demonstrating his range and relevance as an affable, crack-addicted former fighter. Mark Wahlberg plays Dicky's still-fighting brother with unending restraint; he scores points for subtlety in the film's familial drama while losing as many in his charmless, unsmiling romance with Amy Adams's Charlene. There is exactly as much here as is necessary to make the film's finale engaging and rewarding, but very little to remember afterward--it really is quite successful in its predictable underdog ambitions, but it never really aims any higher.<br/><br/>All things considered, the Fighter is almost exactly the lackluster triumph implied in its generic title and trailer--it doesn't reinvent the sport underdog story, but it isn't trying to. This movie only aims to be a quite good entry in its admittedly overaccessable genre; in that it succeeds entirely."

","Maybe 2 is too low, but I really didn't get what the film says.<br/><br/>I was attracted by the high score and positive reviews here and convinced my girlfriend the movie is a must see. But that we are both disappointed. The movie has lousy picture and very slow speed. It put a lot of time on showing the family girls etc. and doesn't really have a focus.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, it should put more time on Micky instead of those other people. it should give more shots to how Micky was turned down and how Micky stood up eventually. it should be a movie giving us heart breaking and motivation. However, Mr. Russel obviously doesn't agree with me and I got nothing back.<br/><br/>All in all, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. It is not entertaining, nor motivating. a totally waste of money and time."
"dfranzen70","4","10","19","17 January 2011"," Unsentimental and dull
","The Fighter<br/><br/>In this true-life sports film, a boxer fights against himself and outside influences to excel against all odds and earn that elusive title shot. In other words, it's virtually identical to every other boxing movie. It's distinguishable only in that the f-word is used about three times a sentence and that Amy Adams gives an improbably iron-willed performance as Mark Wahlberg's bartender girlfriend. But overall, the movie is completely forgettable.<br/><br/>Micky Ward (Wahlberg) is a small-time fighter from the mean streets of Lowell, Massachusetts; his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale) is a former pro who once knocked Sugar Ray Leonard down, so naturally the elder wants the younger to succeed. Trouble is, Micky not only is beset by self doubt (he's lost three fights in a row), he also has to put up with his crackhead half brother and his overbearing, greedy mother (Melissa Leo). So, again, like most other boxing films.<br/><br/>True to form, the movie takes us through Micky's career, first as a stepping stone for other fighters and then, gradually, to the bigger time (Las Vegas and then England). The first half of the movie contains little actual fighting in a ring, then there's a boxing montage (original!) depicting several fights in the space of a couple of minutes, all leading up to the inevitable title bout. <br/><br/>For a movie that uses so much profanity, this one was awfully dull. Hardly anything happens that isn't completely predictable. It's almost as if director David O. Russell set out to make a parody of boxing films. This movie doesn't just use clichés indiscriminately, it robs the cliché bank blind. <br/><br/>It's obvious to the audience from the get-go that Micky's family is holding him back (especially his crazy mother and addict brother), so it's no surprise when he makes the hard decision to move on without them - just as it's no surprise that somehow they wind up helping him, anyway. Part of what inhibits things is the fact that everyone surrounding Micky seems to be more caricature than character. Everyone's weird just to be weird, outlandish just to try to stand out. <br/><br/>And none of it rings true, not for a second - except for Adams as Charlene. Now, if you've seen Amy Adams in anything, you'd be hard pressed to imagine her as a foul-mouthed barkeep who wears short shorts and low-cut tops. And yet here she is, and among all the hysterical, chaotic performances hers is the true standout. She brings a lot more depth to Charlene than anyone else does to their own roles. <br/><br/>The worst of the lot is the otherwise-talented Melissa Leo, who plays Alice Ward as if she were the queen of harpy shrews. Alice berates everyone with a nicotine-tinged screech designed to set your teeth on edge. She also appears to be patterned directly after Linda McMahon of the WWE (and most recently a candidate for governor of Connecticut), complete with hair color and style. It's not a favorable comparison. <br/><br/>One mistake that the movie makes concerns its identity. Is it a serious sports drama? Sometimes, yes; but other times it lapses into basic slapstick. Micky's sisters (or half sisters, I lost track) are like a coven of parrots that exist merely to be the Greek chorus of anger toward anyone they perceive as threatening their family (like, say, Charlene) or to cheerlead for Micky. When the sisters and dear ol' mom figure decide to head over to Charlene's house to scream at her, the scene quickly devolves into Keystone Kops and vaudeville. Rather than being comic relief, it's just sort of embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>All that aside, what really underlines the inept nature of this beast is that the lead characters aren't emotionally engaging, or engaging on any level. By the end, I didn't care if Micky Ward got his title bout, as I found him spineless and stupid and merely an average (looking) boxer. I didn't care at all about his ne'er-do-well brother Dickie, even after he's sent to jail, as I found him obnoxious and dimwitted (even though he loves his bro, surprise!). I didn't care about Alice, who spends 95% of the movie cursing people out for no good reason. It's tough caring about characters when they simply don't give you any reason to. So when bad things happen to them, you're not affected.<br/><br/>It's often unfair to compare movies if they were released decades apart. But we can compare The Fighter with 2005's Cinderella Man, which was also based on a real-life fighter. Russell Crowe and director Ron Howard crafted a story that was plausible and filled with believable characters for whom you could root. It's not that Micky Ward isn't a good guy, it's that he lacks a personality. A personality would have gone a long way toward engaging the viewer. <br/><br/>And, true to its clichéd nature, the film tries to save itself with your garden-variety title match, akin to the Championship Game in just about every baseball movie made. I'll leave it to you to decide how it ends, although the fact that the movie is based on a true story might be a clue."
"secondtake","7","5","8","4 April 2011"," The boxing is just boxing, but the human story, the Lowell scene, is terrific
","The Fighter (2010)<br/><br/>It's hard to make a boxing movie that isn't just another boxing movie, and yet it happens over and over again. The drama in the ring and the cast of odd characters behind the scenes, and the unlikely heroes that most boxers make, are great storytelling stuff. And ""The Fighter"" shows it has the goods, even if it is, at is core, just another boxing movie.<br/><br/>What makes this one special is the particular oddity that two brothers were both contenders, and the family supporting one and then (in a way) the other in their quests was quirky and often nasty in the process. Set in Lowell, Mass., this is working class America of the last two decades, filled with rough poverty, drugs, and its fair share (plus some) of small city losers, one way or another. That's why a winner, or two winners, makes such a fabulous splash. Yet the story is laced with genuine heartbreak, anger, selfishness, idiocy...and determination and savvy. <br/><br/>In the end, something comes out of all this that makes a special case for never prejudging people. That might apply most of all to the family of these two men, with the infighting and truly narrowminded views they naturally had, almost housebound in a poor neighborhood. It's easy to point to the two actors at the center of it, Mark Wahlberg as the younger brother and a shot at the title and Christian Bale as the older one with a serious crack problem. But the rest of the cast, the promoters and the parade of sisters, not to mention the steely over zealous mother and the good guy dad, are all amazing. Amy Adams, an extraordinary talent, comes through with hardened realism as the girlfriend, as well.<br/><br/>The filming here is very good if not conspicuous (it's no ""Raging Bull""), and the story line, hobbled a bit by the fact that it's a true story and had to stick to certain facts, is more inspiring than interesting or dramatic. I mean that in a filmic sense--the boxing part of the story in particular, of an underdog rising up, has been told too often to be especially gripping. <br/><br/>But then, it's all handled so well, and acted with such intensity, you'll end up sucked in and impressed by the end, whatever your (and my) reservations."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","5","8","25 February 2011"," Sometimes boxing out of corners is not confined to the ring.
","The Fighter is directed by David O. Russell and collectively written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson and Keith Dorrington. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. Music is by Michael Brook and cinematographer for the film is Hoyte van Hoytema. Film is based on the true life tale of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Wahlberg), who had to battle thru family strife to give himself a chance of achieving something in the sport.<br/><br/>The synopsis is simple because the film is simple, but sometimes with simplicity comes great things. Such is the case with The Fighter, a boxing film that is that rare old animal of being a cliché riddled sports film: yet one that's totally raw and uplifting into the bargain. The film had a long gestation period, big names such as Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Darren Aronofsky were attached at one point, Scorsese, too, was in the frame to helm at one point, but still Wahlberg couldn't get his dream project off the ground. But all's well that ends well, for as it turned out, Russell, his director on I ♥ Huckabees & Three Kings, stepped into the ring and with Bale now on board too, the elements were in place for a Raging Bull/Rocky of this millennium. Is The Fighter worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as Marty & Sly's pugilistic punchers? Hell yes it is, in fact it carries the gritty tone akin to the former and the feel good factor of the latter.<br/><br/>That Russell has managed to rise above the pitfalls of sports movie formula is an impressive achievement, more so given that this is treading the well worm path of rags-to-riches and triumph over adversity, but he is helped immeasurably by the performances of the principals in the cast. Wahlberg is the heart of the picture, physically he fits the bill anyway, but he has to play conflicted emotion to perfection, as Micky is pulled from pillar to post by all around him, to truly make Ward work. And he does. Bale, in the beginning, you feel is going to lay out a method turn reliant on another one of his punishing physical changes. Yet as the elder Ward brother-a fallen sportsman himself-now a crack addicted dope under the impression he's making a comeback-Bale manages to elicit empathy, sympathy and a request for us to root him out of his rut: quite a feat given the character's obvious fallibility's as kin. Adams as ""the girlfriend"" is spunky, brassy and tough as old boots, it's great to see her get a role so stripped down and raw it lets her showcase her dramatic talents. Rounding out the four pronged propeller of quality thesping is Leo as mother Alice. Brilliantly boisterous, angry and a maternal maelstrom of ignorant parenting, in another's hands this could have been caricature mundanity.<br/><br/>Some missteps exist, such as relegating Adams to the back ground in the last quarter, and for sure the final fight, although well edited and potent, is far too short and rushed to 100% capitalise on the swell of support built up for Micky up to that point. But they are minor gripes, itches easily scratched at when judging the film as a whole. For this is an uplifter for our times; a sports movie that comfortably sits up at the top with the best of them. Bravo. 9.5/10"
"grinchbkb","8","3","4","19 February 2011"," A well-told boxing story appealing to the inside jock hibernating in most of us.
","I loved The Fighter the first time I saw it. It probably has a lot to do with my infatuation with boxing films as a genre – Raging Bull and When We Were Kings rank high in my personal movie pantheon. Russel visibly knows the canon perfectly and manages to pay tribute to all these great virile sport flicks without ending up making a pastiche. The Fighter is full of intertextuality – from the font of the boxing matches' captions to the training routines – it's knowingly self-referential but also playing strictly by the rules, and that's why it works so well despite what could be easily dismissed as a cliché-laden script of another underdog narrative.<br/><br/>The Fighter is based on the real life story of Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a taciturn and limited proletarian grafter very similar to Rocky Balboa (if the latter was Irish and not Italian), trained by his brother Dicky (Christian Bale) like Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. The difference here with Scorsese's classic is that the only sane and sensible character is the fighter; his dysfunctional and self- destructive family (his brother has a serious drug problem while his mom is plain greedy) become his main obstacle on his way to victory. Loyal to his family till the end, Ward wastes his best years until his brother ends up in prison for one crack stunt too many. Now in the twilight of his career, and with the help of his girlfriend, a local barmaid, and a grumpy Irish cop (played by his real-life counterpart) Mickey finds his way back to the ring and stumbles on a chance to fight for the world title, his one and only shot at glory. Will he capture it? Or just let it slip? etc. You get the idea.<br/><br/>Christian Bale once again delivers the performance of a lifetime as the brother/coach of the title character, a local boxing legend turned crack-head. He adds a new dimension to the film, somewhat between cartoonish and pathetic, as if he came straight out of Trainspotting. His lame schemes to support his habit are hilarious, as are his friends from the crackhouse, depicted in the same warm, non-judgemental way of Danny Boyle's cult film. Bale's extravagant albeit touching portrayal is also reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's performance in Jungle Fever, perfectly channelling the madness of the moment under the influence of crack, while maintaining the character's humanity and integrity, avoiding to turn into a white Tyrone Biggums.<br/><br/>In the ropes, Mark Walhberg does what he does best: toughness + Irishness. Bringing vulnerability, grit and authenticity to the film, he leaves the flamboyance to Bale, who in return happily chews the scenery. Marky Mark could have just as easily steal the show like in The Departed but chooses not to. Definitely an underrated actor – mainly because he's capable of restraint.<br/><br/>This is David O. Russel's finest movie since Three Kings, a long awaited comeback for the director who wraps it up perfectly, playing with the different takes on the pugilistic genre, from the ESPN Classic approach (the shooting of a documentary on Dicky unfolds as an important storyline within the film while offering a welcome mise-en-abîme) to the Hollywoodian reconstitution and dramatisation of reality. The boxing fights, alternating inside-the-ring shots à la Raging Bull and HBO's satellite coverage style, are infectiously gripping and perfectly edited. Finally, the recurring use of the song ""How You Like Me Now"" by The Heavy brings energy and coherence, appropriately opening and closing the film.<br/><br/>Admittedly, The Fighter is nothing that we haven't seen before, and was clearly made to provide Christian Bale with a custom-made Oscar vehicle. It is no Michael Man's Ali though, and it is to the credit of the director and the cast if The Fighter still manages to pack a serious punch. A well-told sporting story will always appeal to the inside jock hibernating in most of us.<br/><br/>ggendron.wordpress.com"
"RainDogJr","10","3","4","16 February 2011"," ""make me wanna holler the way they do my life""
","Right now, everybody knows what's the deal with The Fighter. Everybody knows about the performance of Christian Bale. Everybody knows that he is the one who steals the film. Hell, everybody knows that he will win the Oscar for best supporting actor in a couple of weeks. He is fantastic indeed, and I will just add that for me was really remarkable how Bale gains you when the runtime of the movie doesn't even marks 10 seconds. It's great, I was like ""well everybody was right, Bale is doing something truly remarkable here"". I just loved his performance. And that clip during the closing credits showing the real-life Dicky Ward (Bale's character. He is the older brother of the main character) sort of gives *even* more value to Bale's performance as you can see that he really got Dicky. <br/><br/>I saw this one a week ago, a week after I saw for the very first time The Basketball Diaries (1995). Two movies that might be nice companion pieces as they deal with the same subjects: sports, drug addiction and family. And Mark ""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg is in both. The Basketball Diaries goes as the one that presents the ""downfall"" kind of story and here we have a movie about the rise to success. Here the main character, Wahlberg's Micky Ward (yes, Bale steals the movie but not by much as Wahlberg is AMAZING too, making of Micky a truly great and hugely likable main character. Definitely one of the high-points of his acting career), grows in every way during the course of the picture. The problems come from the outside, well, from his very own family to be exact. There we have the ""downfall"" story with Dicky, once a local hero of boxing but now the subject of an HBO documentary about crack cocaine addiction. So there we have the drug addiction thing, the family issues. The Fighter is, as some other IMDb users have said, a crowd-pleasing picture. It's really well constructed, having characters like the ones of Melissa Leo and Amy Adams (the mother and girlfriend of Micky) that really help in order to create the kind of perfect crowd-pleasing picture: with characters you really care for and powerful moments full of emotion moments like when the little known song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, ""Strip My Mind"" (I was like ""I know this song""! it was a really pleasant surprise to hear it here. Also, loved that the soundtrack features classic rock tunes like Led Zeppelin's ""Good Times Bad Times"" and the Rolling Stones' ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking""!), appears (when is like the new beginning for our main character) are the ones that due to the great emotion presented really got me. I'm getting really corny but, thankfully, the movie never does that. Great stuff."

","The Fighter is a fascinating true story about Family. This particular family are working class Irish American and the brothers are boxers. The main interest in this film is to see an absolutely frightening method acting performance from Christian Bale that is both unnerving and Oscar worthy. He plays the elder brother who had the talent but ruined his life through addiction to crack. Wahlberg plays his younger brother who fights in the shadows of his older brother's charisma and powerful presence but finally breaks through to fight 'in Micky's corner'. The story shows the power of family ties and how they can build and destroy. Wahlberg is believable and excellent in his role and Amy Adams gives her best performance to date. The chemistry of the love story between Adams and Wahlberg's characters is really special. I am not a boxing fan but The Fighter really draws you in to the world of these two brothers and their journey together and the turmoils they overcome to find their respective paths. All the supporting actors and their performances make this film an amazing story of human frailty and the strength of family ties. It also provides a social comment about the tough world of American inner city suburbs and their 'fight' for identity. A really fantastic film and worth seeing."

","Two brothers. First there is Dickie, a crack addict, who just also happens to be a washed up fighter, now trainer for his younger brother, who is boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward. Then, there is Micky, a boxer who must battle his own family before he can become a legend in the ring. The Fighter is a familial drama with some sports in it, but like all of the greatest boxing movies, it is when the characters are outside of the ring that the movie wins one over.<br/><br/>Micky's family is what one would call a convoluted battle of the wills. They do not take too kindly to outsiders, or doing things outside of the family, so it is no wonder that neither Dickie, Micky, nor their sisters are married, and you'll fully understand this when you meet their domineering mother, Alice, played to crisp perfection by Melissa Leo. Adding to the strain is Charlene, Micky's new girlfriend, played exceptionally well by Amy Adams, who sees the potential in Micky to be something great, but he must first overcome his family and become his own man if he is to be champion. Actor Mark Whalberg is the heart-and-soul of the movie as Micky Ward, and what more can anyone say about Christian Bale's no holds barred performance as Dickie. This movie is an actor's showcase, featuring some of the best acting you will see in a longtime, and I think a lot of the credit should go to director, David O. Russell.<br/><br/>Russell shoots everything very naturally, there is a flow to it, like the human observer watching these things unfold rather than him intentionally leading us by the hand and manipulating us like so many sports movies have done. I've gotta say, the fight scenes filmed like HBO fights on television was a brilliant choice, not to mention the opening credits when Micky and Dickie walk like kings through the streets of their hometown of Lowell, Mass., these and so many other scenes are just some of the more finely crafted scenes to be projected on the big screen in a long time. In the end, the movie still manages to be uplifting and makes you wanna cheer Micky on, but you don't feel as if you were watching characters, but real people persevere and simply live, that is The Fighter's strong suit, and it is better for it.<br/><br/>I give The Fighter a 10 out of 10!"

","The Fighter contains what is possibly the best acting ensemble of 2010. With Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo in the central roles, you will be in for a satisfying and emotionally exhausting time. This film showcases the amazing true story of Micky Ward, a talented boxer looking for a second chance at his career. His brother Dicky used to be a talented, promising boxer himself. Unfortunately, Dicky succumbed to drug addiction and spends most of his time out smoking crack. Micky's manager mother doesn't always book him with the best opponents either for his career or health. His barmaid girlfriend Charlene is supportive but also tends to clash with him. Fortunately, he is able to get back on track and proves himself to be the talented athlete that people once knew him to be. Director David O. Russell creates a marvelous and intense drama that captivates you with each montage, acting moment, and boxing scene. The script fills each scene with raw emotion and intensity. As mentioned, the acting from all four actors is terrific. All four of them deserve Oscar nominations. Melissa Leo and Christian Bale are deservedly the favorites to win the Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actor Oscars for their authentic and rich performances. They prove why it is often difficult to portray any real-life person. The Fighter is an extremely well-acted and rousing drama that everyone should see."

","With all of the boxing movies already out there (Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Rocky, Cinderella Man and so on and so forth) why, pray tell, do we need another? They are all essentially telling the same story. A rise to fame or a fall from glory. What more can they do with the idea? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Fighter. I am not a fan of boxing in general, but I truly found myself becoming emotionally involved with the characters in this movie. There is so much heart that comes across.<br/><br/>Our hero is Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg). He grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts where he learned everything he knows about boxing from his brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale). His mother and manager, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) is obsessed with her boys fighting and wants them to be the greatest. After all, in his heyday, Dicky knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. This is his big claim to fame and we hear about it at least one hundred times in the first half hour of the film. Dicky Eklund, the pride of Lowell.<br/><br/>When Mickey is entered into a fight against someone nearly twice his size because his original opponent falls ill, he is embarrassed and walks away from everyone and everything with one exception: Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). As someone who has seen Enchanted more times than any sane person with most of their functioning brain cells left, I had a pretty squeaky-clean image of Amy Adams in my mind. She acted the hell out of an otherwise understated role and did it with all the strength of a woman who doesn't take guff from anyone.<br/><br/>Charlene and Mickey start dating, much to the chagrin of Mickey's sisters and mother who think she is just going to distract him. My favorite is when they dub her the ""MTV girl"" which means that she is wild. Mickey's sisters what can one say about this group of girls? With big hair, blue eye shadow, and a beer/cigarette in hand at any given moment, they are one tough crowd to please. See if you can pick out Kate O' Brien, Conan O' Brien's sister, in the group.<br/><br/>But I digress Charlene has Mickey's best interests at heart and tries to get him back on track to becoming a great fighter and maybe winning a title. With Dicky Eklund running around and getting into all sorts of shenanigans, Mickey has to focus on himself long enough to forget about his crazy brother and get back in the ring.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives a spot-on performance. His likability in this film is a constant up and down. I found at one point I had genuine disdain for him. To me, this is one of the signs of a great actor. I don't know who he is in real life, though I've heard stories — ""No, Bruce. Let me finish."" — but he worked my range of emotions here and came out on top.<br/><br/>One of my favorite characters in the film was George Ward (Jack McGee). He brings a levelheadedness to an prodigiously chaotic situation.<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie oozes heart and is packed with tremendously talented actors. Sure to get a look from the Academy, The Fighter is one of the best from 2010.<br/><br/>(Search mssilverscreen for more of my reviews)"

I lost an older sister to addiction, and I admit that I cried like a baby at the end of this film.. It hit on so many emotional chords, such as addiction, despair, and redemption..

","Based on a true story of professional boxer Micky Ward, The Fighter is about how Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) fights his way of family and friends to the championship title. Dicky (Christian Bale), Micky's half-brother and trainer, is a drug addict that always fail to show up for training. Their relationship is complicated because Micky wanted more than just a crackhead brother who doesn't know what he's doing. Supporting along that line come Alice (Mellisa Leo), the brothers' mother and manager, who also wants Micky to stay with her and Dicky instead of going to someone better. After meeting the love of his life Charlene (Amy Adams), who convinced Micky that his family's no good, he decided to go on and try something else. Success with the new manager and trainer, Micky got the shot of the title match.<br/><br/>Mark Walhberg who plays the boxer is to many critics the lowpoint of the film. Every time the camera focuses on him, it seems like he doesn't have anything to say. Perhaps the writing for Walhberg isn't as concentrated and too vague compare to his co-stars. Walhberg was suppose to carry the film with his role but instead it felt like his co-star Christian Bale did all the heavy lifting. Playing a drug addict who went to jail for resisting arrest and assaulting an officer, Bale (Dicky) was at his best. Emotionally understanding and physically confused by years of sitting on his ass, Dicky's only job was to train his brother into the championship. Bale gave up this amazing vibe that he knows what he's doing but at the same time too confused to do it right. The film, rather than focusing on Mark Walhberg, did a completely different character study on Christian Bale. Carrying along the heavy loads are Mellisa Leo and Amy Adams who played the mother and girlfriend of Walhberg. Leo and Adams had a chemistry in which both hated each other and both share the same goal of helping Dicky. Delivering explicit lines, Amy Adams is the best I've seen her in years. With two Oscar nominations already, she might even earn her third.<br/><br/>Though the cast is above average, the writing in some parts were off. It seems like the writers wanted the actors themselves to carry the film without dialogue. They thought they can depend on the actors, but it is impossible for the actors to do any good without a solid script.<br/><br/>David O. Russell finely crafted the film, but at times, it looked as if only the fighting scenes count. Focusing too much on the fights instead aiming to offer drama, he made the movie looked like an ESPN fight show. But set aside all of that, David O. Russell's got a talent in him and the fight scenes do look amazing. Perhaps his biggest contribution to the film is his directing of the cast.<br/><br/>The Fighter has a predictable plot yet it pulls out so much depth offered by the cast that we can say The Fighter is finely entertaining.<br/><br/>OscarBuzz: Best Picture (with 10 nod this year, it will be nominated), Best Supporting Actor (Christian Bale, win), Best Supporting Actress (Mellisa Leo, Amy Adams, both have a good chance), Best Score, Best Cinematography"
"Reel_starz","8","3","4","19 December 2010"," The Fighter: Beating the Odds
","Over the past decade, sports movies have, for better or worse, become virtually monopolized by Disney. Some, like Remember the Titans, Miracle and Cinderella Man (which is actually Universal/Miramax but follows in the same tradition as its Disney counterparts), are genuinely inspiring, but most feel like little more than rote exercises; you can sense the boxes being marked off: underdog protagonist, check; stern but motivating, has-been mentor, check; training montage, rising-toward-success montage, rousing speech or crowd cheering sequence during climax, check, check, check; throw in some sociopolitical issue to raise the stakes, just for good measure. It's as if they think audiences will forgive the clichéd mediocrity of the whole affair just because the words ""based on a true story"" are written on the poster.<br/><br/>The Fighter is not one of those movies. That isn't to say it doesn't follow the generic sports movie storyline, because for the most part, it does. There's the underdog protagonist, ""Irish"" Micky Ward who starts the film off by telling everyone he's going to win a fight he ultimately loses so badly he's afraid to show his face for weeks; the mentor, his half-brother Dicky Eklund who coulda been a contendah before succumbing to crack cocaine addiction; the usual string of montages, though the everyone-rallies-around-the-hero scene is thankfully absent.<br/><br/>And yet, something about David O. Russell's latest project feels fresh, very un-sports movie-ish. Maybe it's the way he ignores the clichés, rather than attempting to avoid them, acknowledging that they're inevitable because this is, after all, based on a true story, but never embracing them. There's no swelling music during the boxing scenes (in fact, aside from some choice rock/pop ditties scattered here and there, there isn't much of a score at all), and the grainy, documentary-like cinematography gives the proceedings a refreshingly authentic feel. Maybe it's the austere yet intimate script, which revels in the grit and grime of both Lowell, Massachusetts and the world of boxing without glorifying either, unflinching in its portrayal of the story's main players.<br/><br/>According to most, it's the cast, which is, if not the outright best part, then certainly the most celebrated aspect of The Fighter. While promoting the movie, Mark Wahlberg made his love for the subject clear, describing the work he put into getting it made and why he stuck with it even as directors and prospective costars came and went. His passion and dedication comes through in his portrayal of Micky Ward, whom he turns into less of the earnest Everyman he played in 2006's Invincible, one of the aforementioned unremarkable entries in Disney's sports movie catalog, and more into someone who boxes as much for pure survival as for enjoyment of the sport. His central conflict is not whether or not he can win the next bout, though that is also important, but whether he can find personal success without abandoning his dysfunctional but ardently loyal family; we relate to and care about his struggle, and root for him because of that.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, of the ensemble, Wahlberg is most likely to be overlooked by viewers. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams both take radically different turns from their most well-known roles, and to great effect. Melissa Leo's Alice, Micky's mother and manager, is bossy and domineering, the sort of woman who can turn men into whimpering puppies with one glance, but taking advantage of her few emotional moments, such as one where she and Dicky sing the Bee Gees's ""I Started a Joke"", Leo humanizes her enough to prevent the Ward/Eklund matriarch from becoming a complete shrew. In comparison, Charlene initially seems demure, though we later learn she's not afraid of a fight (or a little booze). She holds her head up high because she went to college, but in truth, she's as much of a failure as any of the boorish patrons at the bar where she works. Amy Adams eschews stereotype for realism, glamour for raw honesty, and we believe her a hundred percent.<br/><br/>The majority of attention will, no doubt, go to Christian Bale, who is guaranteed to pick up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, if not the win, for his work here. As Dicky Eklund, Bale delivers a performance that, while certainly demanding, seems light-hearted, almost comedic at times compared to what one might expect given the actor's propensity for intense, brooding roles. Though he physically transformed himself for the part, he wows us not by focusing on theatrical mannerisms or wallowing in melodrama the way most actors would have, but by revealing the person behind the addiction; he plays Dicky Eklund, not a drug addict. Because, in spite of everything, Eklund is one charismatic and goofy guy, and it's not hard to understand why he is still considered a local hero for beating - or ""beating"", depending on who you ask - Sugar Ray Leonard in the late '70s, rather than a local disappointment for subsequently squandering his potential. When Dicky watches a documentary he claimed was about his ""comeback"" but is instead about crack addiction with him as the main subject, honest-to-God tears sprang to my eyes; his moment of realization is almost painful to watch. What makes Christian Bale so great can be extended to the rest of the cast as well: they don't portray roles, they portray characters, people.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a combination of all the above points that makes The Fighter work. More than anything else, it's a character-study of Micky and those involved in his search for a better life, even if that life lasts only a moment. In fact, the no-frills, relationship-centric approach arguably robs the climactic fight of a bit of its power considering that, by then, the dramatic conflicts have largely been resolved. Nonetheless, this is a great movie with strong performances, writing and direction that manages to breathe new life into a tired and trite genre. What were the odds?"
"Hellmant","9","3","4","18 December 2010"," Oscar front-runner Bale really disappears into the role!
","'THE FIGHTER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>David O. Russell directs this boxing tale based on professional boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward 's rise to stardom and his troubled brother Dicky who helped train him. Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky and Oscar front-runner (for supporting actor) Christian Bale co-stars as Dicky. Russell is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, his previous credits include 'THREE KINGS', 'I HEART HUCKABEES', 'FLIRTING WITH DISASTER' and 'SPANKING THE MONKEY'. Three of his five films have all co-starred Wahlberg, almost every director has a go to guy and for Russell it's apparently Wahlberg. I never used to think he had much talent as an actor but he's proved himself a little over the years (he was outstanding in 'I HEART HUCKABEES'). He's still not a great actor in my opinion and he's just OK in this film, although fittingly cast (he was much better this year in 'THE OTHER GUYS', in my opinion). It's Bale that really steals the movie and he definitely deserves all the award recognition. There's also some great supporting turns from Melissa Leo as the brothers' mother and Amy Adams as Micky's girlfriend (two other likely Oscar contenders. They were both nominated for Golden Globes, as well as Bale and surprisingly Wahlberg).<br/><br/>Russell took over directing duties from Darren Aronofsky who took an executive producer position instead (I also saw Aronofsky's 'BLACK SWAN' right before this, so for me it was an Aronofsky double feature). I think Russell was the right man for the job and did an exceptional job, Aronofsky is an equally impressive director though and has a strikingly different style. It's interesting to think how the film might have turned out had he directed it. The film is written by Paul Tamsay, Eric Johnson, Keith Dorrington and Scott Silver (who also wrote '8 MILE'). The writing team did a great job as well; the movie is equally clever and funny as well as dramatically moving and inspiring. It's quite a unique film going experience.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Micky's attempt to get his welterweight boxing career going. Out of love he allows his mother to manage him and his brother to train him. His brother is a former local boxing hero who went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and actually knocked him down (although some argue that he tripped). Now Dicky is a crack addict and has a film crew following him around making a documentary on crack addiction, although he tells people they're making a film on his boxing comeback. Dicky and his mother are keeping Micky down and he knows it but he doesn't have the heart to cut them loose. After falling for a local bartender and Dicky is sent to prison for his latest crime scheme Micky finally gains control of his life and his boxing career and sets up new management and enlists a new trainer, a local cop and friend (much to the disappointment of his over controlling mother). The film follows his inspiring rise to fame as he becomes a boxing hero and lifts his family out of despair.<br/><br/>Bale's ability to transform himself from one role to another really shows in this role as he disappears into the character. While he will win the Oscar for supporting actor some argue he should be up for lead, as the film is just as much about him as Wahlberg's character (If they put him up for lead the studio knows he probably wont get it though so the safer bet is to promote him for supporting, that's how the business works). Although Bale makes the movie the entire cast is exceptional as well and like I said the directing and writing is outstanding too. The movie is a classic inspiring boxing film, one not like any you've ever seen before (although the outcome is predictable). It's definitely worth checking out and one that will be remembered for many years to come, like all of Russell's films.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ"

","In the midst of my work and Christmas shopping, I felt the need to catch this multi-nominated film. I am so glad I did because it is outstanding. OK, the typical ingredients of a boxing flick are here. A down-and-out underdog protagonist, the training scenes, the boxing ring scenes, the redemption towards the end. But the remarkable thing about this particular film is the fantastic acting, which can already be seen in the awards nominations already announced.<br/><br/>The ironic thing here is that the supporting actors have more acting challenges than the main character. It is good that Mark Wahlberg (as Micky Ward) was finally nominated for his acting, but his co-stars really stole the thunder from under him. He was basically underplaying his quiet character. Unfortunately, I also felt Wahlberg was miscast, being too old to be playing a young boxer on the rise. He was very realistic during the actual boxing scenes, as though he was a real boxer. (Wahlberg's training sessions with his idol Manny Pacquiao was very evident!)<br/><br/>Christian Bale had the showiest role as Micky's self-destructive half- brother and trainer Dicky Eklund. He was as far from his Bruce Wayne persona as can be. He was gaunt, slovenly and garrulous. Melissa Leo, wow, shines in another very showy role! She is amazingly realistic as the domineering mother of these two boxers. Her Alice was a most self- possessed, quarrelsome and hateful character as they come. <br/><br/>Amy Adams also plays against her usual type as sassy Charlene, Micky's girlfriend who gives him back his confidence and a way out of his losing predicament. Even the more minor supporting characters were well- played: Jack Mc Gee as George Ward, Mickey O Keefe as himself, and even the seven annoying women who played the big-haired white-trashy sisters of Micky.<br/><br/>This film is fast-paced and interesting to watch. Director David O. Russell does a very good job in helming this project. I am glad it is getting the awards consideration it is currently earning. Very sure that the three supporting actors will make it all the way to the Oscar nomination listing."
"bob the moo","Null","4","6","5 June 2011"," Just a great piece of story telling
","I have been burnt so many times around Oscar time of year – films that come out with a lot of fanfare and glory, films that seem very ""worthy"" but ones that ultimately don't deliver on the screen where it matters. Daniel Craig's Defiance comes to mind but there have been others. Anyway, for this reason I stayed out of the crowds for The Fighter and only got round to watching it recently. I was very pleased to find that, although not a classic, The Fighter is just a solidly great film that satisfies across the board even if it isn't the classic that some would have you believe.<br/><br/>The plot comes from a true story and is as much about the character as it is about the sport. While the fights produce the type of energy and drama that we are used to with Hollywood sports movie it is the relationships that provide the bulk of the film and draw the viewer into the story and caring about the characters. Although some liberties are taken with facts (the final fight was in the UK, not in the US) and I'm sure the characters have been handled the same way but yet they still really engage. The family background is made up of a strong willed women and a bunch of big-haired, small-town daughters that look like snakes on the head of their mother Medusa; it is very well done and it is such a strong part of the film. The brother's battle with drugs moves along the main sporting plot really well, complimenting and working with it. Meanwhile of course the rise from nothing to having a chance to be champion is the reason we all watch sport – everyone loves the underdog.<br/><br/>The story could have been badly told or a little corny but the delivery is strong and it helps that the cast are roundly great. Although the others get the awards, it is Wahlberg that does some of the finest work. He doesn't have the mannerisms, he doesn't have the bigger character so he understates it and allows the others to work, thus being the foundation for them to be effective. Bale is tremendous; watching action blockbusters where his voice is comically deep makes you forget that he is essentially a brilliant actor. His Dicky is very real and very well drawn physically and mentally. Although Melissa Leo almost blew it with those ridiculous adverts, her performance is strong enough t overcome those for the Oscar and she does well here. Her monstrous but also well-meaning mother is great. Adams plays very much the level below these but she is still very good while the supporting cast all play their parts convincingly throughout.<br/><br/>The Fighter is not a perfect film but it is a really great one. The sporting drama is complimented by the character drama and these two elements are all made to work thanks to strong direction, writing and of course a collection of actors who deserve every good thing said about them in this film. Ignore all the hype and awards though, just come to it as a film and I'm sure you'll be impressed by just what a roundly strong piece of story-telling it all is."

This is the first time that I see the gorgeous Amy Adams without any glamor but she is still a very beautiful woman. The most impressive is that this dramatic story is based on a true story. Outstanding! My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Vencedor"" (""The Winner"")"
"jimcheva","9","6","11","3 December 2010"," Lean, taut, moving, with some powerful performances
","Among the many excellent things about this film, the first one that struck me is just how taut the structure is. It moves hard and fast all the way through, even in the most emotional movements. This alone should make it one to study for any would-be screenwriter who would like to learn about pacing (some judiciously chosen hard-driving rock doesn't hurt). This does not in the least prevent the film from exploring some issues that go well beyond the boxing struggles that are its surface subject. This is very much about how your family can hold you back (a bit in this way like ""Million Dollar Baby""), but remain vital as your anchor nonetheless and also about negotiating competing emotional demands (demands from people who all truly love you) while eking out a clear view of your own individuality and needs. All of which could be very touch-feely and ""deep"" in another kind of film but is simply a central fact here in a narrative that never stops moving. Wahlberg does a solid, even excellent, job as the protagonist, and Amy Adams is working class tough and sexy in a way we rarely get to see, but the memorable acting here comes from Christian Bale - virtually unrecognizable even when you know who he is - and Melissa Leo, whose star has been rising so nicely since ""Frozen River"" but who has never so far as I know transformed herself so entirely as she does here to play a fierce but vulnerable working class matriarch - to the extent that I was wondering who this excellent unknown was until I saw the credits. Kudos too to the actresses playing the five sisters (not to mention wardrobe and make-up) for creating a combination Greek chorus/sight gag that is one of the film's lighter but more wonderful touches. Otherwise, to the degree that this is a boxing movie, it is an excellent one. The fight scenes are visceral and authentic, yet retain the gladiatorial nobility that lets us understand why the main characters here feel that this violent, even vicious sport offers a worthy arena for meaningful, even heroic, achievement."

The film begins with the two brother's being interviewed in 1993 and flashing back to tell the story. Before his crack addiction, Dicky was known for knocking out boxing legend Sugar Ray in his hay day. He has always looked out for his younger brother Mickey and has trained him to be a boxer as well. However, Mickey is on a losing streak and is down on his luck. He has a large family that is part of the boxing business. His mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo, Nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama), is Mickey's manager while his father George Ward (Jack McGee) tries to help him get a better manager and make him some more money. Mickey's luck is turned around when he starts dating a bartender named Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams, Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama) dragging her into the family business. Everything comes together as the fight for kinship begins as Mickey, Dicky, Alice, Jack and Charlene work to restore the family name and celebrate in Mickey's Corner. <br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is all about the acting performances of the best ensemble cast of the year. Wahlberg, Bale, Leo, and Adams are raiding all of the spots for the acting nominations at every awards show. The four cast members mentioned along with Jack McGee have been nominated as a whole for two best ensemble cast awards and have won one already. With this being said the best part of the movie is Christian Bale's portrayal of Dicky Ecklund. He lost a ridiculous amount of weight for the role for the second time in his acting career (""The Machinist"", 2004) weighing the least he has in years at 121 pounds. Bale has always been an amazing actor being able to break away from his strong English accent to play American characters with a flawless American accent. He is completely different than you have ever seen him before and hands down is going to pick up numerous awards this awards season including the Oscar. All of these performances create the originality of the film from a well- known plot line.<br/><br/>The story starts out very slow taking 30 or 40 minutes to kick into full swing. The screenplay is very well written and performed, however, the film is still very predictable. The plot has been used over and over again must memorably in the ""Rocky"" franchise. The film is very straightforward and does not have any surprises along the way, but in the end does this really matter?<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is a very enjoyable movie that is easy to enjoy. Lead by the best acting of the year the film has set the standard for ensemble casts of the future by telling a real life ""Rocky"" story that you need to see now!"

","I've lived in Lowell, Massachusetts for about a year and a half. Micky Ward is a legend around here and this movie does his august reputation justice. The story is beautifully told, and, as a life time Bay-Stater, I can safely say this movie presents the most accurate picture of the people of Massachusetts I've ever seen. It has everything the great boxing movies have, just with the Irish ""go f--- yourself"" attitude that makes Mass. so entertaining. Whalberg is fantastic, Bale should take home an Oscar and Amy Adams is nothing short of mesmerizing. Daivd O. Russell's direction is fantastic. The movie is fast paced, beautifully and has a great soundtrack that will make you want to box someone as soon as you leave the theater. The Fighter is heart-warming, inspiring, funny and a great way to spend two hours."
"heywood_jablomey","4","9","20","8 January 2011"," Awful
","I'll start with the positive. Good production values and some decent cinematography but all in all it was just a very run of the mill predictable film. All the stereotypes are there, guy at the lowest point of his life, works his way up, has family problems, work on his personal life and professional life and is a great success. I thought Christian Bale put a decent effort in, but even with all that weight loss the performance just wasn't believable. One other good thing that I thought was good(for those who think I am being unfair) was the dialogue. It sounded very believable and real. I just didn't care for the characters, they were far too cardboard and out of a storyboard.<br/><br/>Honestly, you can guess what happens next. No, I didn't miss the point of this movie."

","Finally after weeks of wanting to watch this movie, i had the chance to do so, specially after watching all of this years big anticipated Hollywood blockbusters that has 8+ rating on here.<br/><br/>Overall its a good movie, but not what was expected of it, The Movie revolves about Ward's (Mark Wahlberg) Life. which is nice and very dramatic. the thing you wouldn't expect in a boxing movie. the fights are rare, the build up of the story is quit slow that leaves you a bit bored an hour into the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing that entertained and lifted the movie to its high expectations is Christian Bale, WOW!!, a golden globe nomination performance. without him & his character this movie wouldn't be this special.<br/><br/>In the end i do recommend this movie to boxing fans & A MUST to Christian Bale's lovers, but don't expect anything like Cinderella Man."

","Not wrote a review before on IMD but felt after watching this movie that i had to. Lets start by saying i'm not a fan of Mr Bale i find his real persona at times colours my feelings of his movie roles not the case with the fighter quite simply he deserves the Oscar for Supporting Role as does Amy Adams and Melissa Leo its a shame they cant both get it although there have been ties in the past.From the opening scenes taking the viewer through the HBO filming of Dickys comeback to the end titles its pure dramatic joy, the scenes of family life with the Ward / Eklunds are pure fly on the wall type viewing. Quite simply an excellent movie even if you hate boxing you will enjoy the Drama."

","Mark Wahlberg keeps up to as the brother and aspiring boxer. Amy Adams was great as Mark's girlfriend, and the entire supporting cast was pitch perfect. How did they ever cast the family? One gets the impression they were real life & not actors. The mother and her brood of harpie daughters were the roughest bunch of females ever to appear in a movie that wasn't science fiction. You could definitely see how they were cut from the same mold as Bale's character but Wahlberg's character seemed too decent to be from that group of people.<br/><br/>You wonder who gets the nod for best actor in this film. Wahlberg or Bale? Bale's character might seem to be confined to a supporting actor nod but Bale made the film a great one and if it wins best picture (which seems like a good bet), Bale would seem to be inline to get most of the credit.<br/><br/>Anyway, a great picture, not to be missed. Quite possibly one of the best boxing films ever made. And Bale's performance was one for the ages."
"cultfilmfan","10","4","7","19 December 2010"," The Fighter
","The Fighter is based on the true story of Mickey Ward, who hopes to become a boxer as his older brother Dicky used to be quite good and was even in a huge fight on television that earned him a lot of respect. Dicky now these many years later is a crack addict and also Mickey's trainer, but he can never get to their training sessions on time and also a lot of the time he is burned out and oblivious to what is going on around him. Mickey's mother Alice, is his manager, but so far Mickey's fights haven't been all that successful and he longs for more. After meeting a feisty bar waitress named Charlene, she gives Mickey confidence and helps analyze the situation and helps him realize his true potential to become a champion fighter, but if he is to be successful he may have to do it without his family behind him because as Charlene sees it, they are holding him back more than anything and not really helping. The Fighter is a movie about boxing as I said above and about someone trying to become a boxer, but you do not have to know anything about the sport of boxing to enjoy this movie because that is only one aspect of the story. I personally am not really into sports, so if this film had just been a lot of sports manoeuvres and long drawn out boxing matches, I can imagine that it would not have been for me, but the way they put it together made me love what I was watching and earned a huge amount of respect from me after I had watched it. Mickey grew up in a rough side of town with seven sisters, a crack addicted brother who is continually getting into different forms of trouble and they just live a different type of lifestyle. They smoke and swear continuously and there is a great amount of dysfunction in this family. I am glad that this film did not shy away from those parts, but instead focused on them and made them an important part of the story. Yes at times the film is quite gritty and earthy and even at times disturbing, but it feels real and generates real emotion in us the viewers. If this had been a big glamorous Hollywood project with big production values and everything a little more flashy and slick I could not have seen the film having the same impact that it does now the way they did it. We also get to see the family interact and although there is so much dysfunction and even a bit of greed in them, I think deep down they do really want what is best for each other, but they just have to find that out first and discover it inside themselves. The story here is terrific. It gives us great character depth and study of all the main characters and does what I like best in these type of films, when they show the heroes, or main characters of these films and do not cover up their flaws and weaknesses, but instead put them on display and work with those elements to further enhance the story and make it believable. The film has a great pace and is absolutely riveting to watching. The direction is handled very well here as is the screenplay and it comes off beautifully from these top notch actors and their performances. Everyone is so good in this film in the different roles and personas they have to portray. For example, Christian Bale really gets into the look and the face and body language of a drug addict and at times it looks a little interesting, but he also shows us how tragic it is and that we really need to care for this character and all the emotion and work he puts into this performance is brilliant. I think of all the films I have seen Christian Bale in thus far, I would go as far as to say that this is so far his best performance in what will be a very long career. Also do not be surprised if he wins a Supporting Actor Oscar next year because he is truly deserving and I can not think of too many other male performances this year that were just as good, or even better. The supporting cast is all great here as well and also deserving of praise. This film will draw you in, fascinate you and take you on a roller coaster of emotions, but it is one you will be glad you went to see. Along with The Social Network, The Fighter is so far the best American film I have seen of 2010. Granted, I still have a lot to see, but this is a perfect film and in boxing terms a real knock out. Go see it at once."
"cn1793","5","9","22","28 December 2010"," I did NOT like this movie
","Unlike most of the IMDb reviewers, I did not like The Fighter. Perhaps if I had read the book or even read some of these reviews so I knew some of the background, I'd have understood it better--but I still would have wondered why anyone thought this movie needed to be made.<br/><br/>Haven't there been enough movies about underdog boxers who persevered until they came out on top? Haven't there been enough movies about drug addiction--and don't most of them make it plain right away that the addict is addicted, not the victim of having been hit a few too many times in the head? Haven't there been enough movies about overbearing, controlling mothers who would sacrifice their children if doing so suited their purposes? Haven't there been enough movies about dysfunctional families that are unemployed and just sit around the house minding each other's business? Rolling them into one movie does not a ""fresh"" approach make.<br/><br/>The redeeming feature of this film is the cast. Melissa Leo and Christian Bale take turns chewing the scenery. One of the recurring ""jokes""--when ""Dicky"" dives out of the window (of what I found out too late to appreciate it was a crack house--I thought his racist mother objected to his having an Asian girlfriend) into the dumpster--provided some humanity to their characters. Their leaving the scene while singing ""I Started a Joke"" provided the most poignant moment in their on-screen relationship. Mark Wahlberg was much more understated, by contrast, to the point that my companion opined that ""He was just playing himself."" Amy Adams was spot-on with her portrayal of the hurt-to-the-core-but-still-spunky bartender cum girlfriend. Their scene with ""Micky's"" daughter provided their opportunity to show a human soft side. The exception is the ""seven sisters,"" who were like a Greek chorus. I cringe to contemplate what the original Eklund/Ward sisters thought of the way they were portrayed on the screen.<br/><br/>Christian Bale looks much older than his actual age in this film, and he apparently lost a huge amount of weight again (after doing so for The Machinist). I hope he wins enough awards for this film to satisfy his ambition before he permanently damages his health! <br/><br/>I never could identify with any of the characters in The Fighter. I could never actually like any of them--they were either shrill, whacked out, displaying their worst behavior, committing crimes with nothing to redeem them, or generally providing a negative demeanor--so I never cared one way or the other about any of them. Considering that so many people found the movie entertaining, I have spent a lot of time analyzing why that was not true for me, and I have to conclude that the Eklund/Ward family is like a train wreck. It's awful, but a lot of people want to see every awful moment of it."
"DoNotTrustImdb","3","8","19","8 February 2011"," Disappointing
","Lots of boxing films have been made over the years, some that are done well and make for great entertainment based purely on the script/storyline, this film does not fit in to that category. I never at any point of this film felt like I was drawn in to the story, and it never makes you feel part of the story being told, the acting is poor, and why did they cast Bale? He is over rated and I find him annoying to watch as an actor. It was a real drag to watch this till the end, and I was glad when it ended, poorly directed, sub standard acting makes this film a real disappointment.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"
"StevePulaski","9","3","5","19 March 2011"," A cast of champs
","The Fighter is one of those films that after you watch it you feel almost that you lived it. It has a quality very few films have. Some films like Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Sex and the City 2 make you feel like you're watching a poorly written film or are just staring at characters that you have no desire to watch. The Fighter has the right amount of intensity, realism (which it should), and a great cast to seal the deal.<br/><br/>While I haven't seen The King's Speech, I can say Colin Firth has some hefty competition as he better win me over as Prince Albert. Because as of now, its looking like Wahlberg should've deserved it. My goal is to watch all the Best Picture nominees of The Oscars before June, my set deadline. Franco was good, Eisenberg was great, but Wahlberg is a character in this film.<br/><br/>The plot: Welterweight boxer Mickey Ward (Wahlberg) struggles to make a name for himself as he tries to fight his way to fame. His big mouthed, former crackhead brother Dicky (Bale) is his trainer and his mother, played by the fabulous, well deserving Oscar winner Melissa Leo is his manager.<br/><br/>Mickey is constantly babied and spoon-fed by his mother who feels that if someone isn't family they're not worth their time. Her personality comes forth when Mickey is offered to be trained in Vegas. Of course anyone would jump at the opportunity, but Mickey's uptight family (with the exception of his dad) refuses to let him.<br/><br/>That is until Mickey meets a lovely young bartender named Charlene (Adams) who is Mickey's girlfriend. She encourages him to stand up for what he wants to do, only to be named ""an MTV girl"" by Mickey's nine sisters.<br/><br/>It's a thrill I got to see The Fighter for a low price on Xbox Live's Zune. It's something that is well worthy of the title ""a must see film."" The end was a tiny bit disappointing, but not everything is perfect. Everything has a flaw. I cheered a little for Mickey, but I felt that something else should've happened at the end. Like Raging Bull had a little bit of a ""wow"" moment at the end. The Fighter doesn't have an ending that is truly shocking.<br/><br/>Regardless, it doesn't drag the film down a whole lot. Wahlberg is fantastic, Bale is wonderful, Leo is powerful, just powerful, and Adams is one of the strongest female leads of 2010. She gets into her role as Charlene and just hits everything spot on. It seems after doing bad romantic comedies she finally hit the jackpot.<br/><br/>Director David O. Russell's documents one of the most gripping fighting films in my recent memory, and ranks up with Scorsese's Raging Bull. The action on screen is great and The Fighter is an all around enjoyment.<br/><br/>Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams. Directed by: David O. Russell."
"EUyeshima","8","3","5","19 January 2011"," Three Powerful Turns in a Biopic That Favors Family Dynamics Over Rounds in the Ring
","A trio of remarkable performances propels this frenetic, punch-drunk take on a dysfunctional family saga, and the compelling 2010 drama marks a return to form for iconoclastic director David O. Russell (his last film was the failed existential comedy, 2004's ""I Heart Huckabees""). Written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson, the film tells the fact-based story of boxing half-brothers ""Irish"" Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, eking out a blue-collar existence in Lowell, Massachusetts. Dicky once went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard back in 1978, but it's the mid-1980's now, and he's vainly trying to recapture that moment of notoriety. Micky, on the other hand, remains firmly in Dicky's shadow, as he tries to follow in his footsteps and become a professional fighter. Most of the plot focuses on the demons that haunt and control them. Dicky's are internal as he has deteriorated into a scarifying crack addict and criminal, while Micky's struggles come from the stranglehold his family has on his life and career. Dicky is Micky's trainer, and their hell-bent, bottle-blonde mother Alice is his manager, neither of whom are willing to admit that they aren't savvy enough to get Micky a decent shot at the welterweight title.<br/><br/>Micky's one personal salvation comes from his no-nonsense girlfriend Charlene, a tough-talking bartender who goes toe to toe with Alice and her seven grown, detestable daughters. Naturally, this sets the stage for a battle over Micky's soul. The irony of the film is that Micky has to be a dramatically inert figure since he is really a victim of his family's volatility. Consequently, Mark Wahlberg leverages his likable average-guy demeanor to play him in an economic manner that manages to evoke sympathy for his stoic, often passive character. This gives room for Christian Bale to steal his scenes handily with blazing intensity as Dicky. He dropped thirty pounds to shape his wiry, bug-eyed performance, and it sears in the memory. The gifted Melissa Leo (""Frozen River"", ""Conviction"") is equally fearless as the manipulative Alice, a vainglorious Lady Macbeth figure who is willing to steer her son toward failure if it means he won't abandon her. As Charlene, Amy Adams (""Enchanted"") surprises the most with a flurry of F-bombs that serve to protect her clear-eyed commitment to Micky, even though her character has been developed mostly on one angry note. All three deserve recognition during the awards season.<br/><br/>If the movie has one persistent flaw, it's that most of the rest of the characters are reduced to caricatures, especially Alice's big-haired daughters who act like a dispiriting Greek chorus to the proceedings (and strangely no bratty children surrounding them). The comic moments are welcome, but sometimes the approach feels like it cheapens the story. Russell's idiosyncratic filmmaking style is evident throughout with the camera constantly shifting to match the nervous energy of the narrative. In order to stick to the facts, he and the screenwriters shift the story in the home stretch to Micky's journey toward the title and more or less, abandon the head-butting family dynamics driving most of the story. Although the film ties up the fate of the characters neatly, it begins to feel more like ""Rocky"" than ""Raging Bull"" toward the end, and a certain hollowness permeates the film's resolution, even though cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema does an excellent job staging the fights leading to the inevitable ending. However, these are forgivable lapses in judgment given the stellar work of Leo, Adams and especially Bale."
"MovieManMenzel","8","3","5","11 January 2011"," Bale, Wahlberg, and Adams all fight for the Oscar in ""The Fighter""
","Based on true events, ""The Fighter"" tells the story of boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and his rise to fame. While focusing on Micky's life, the film also focuses on his family especially his brother Dicky (Christian Bale). The film starts off with Micky being a fighter living in his brother Dicky's shadow. We learn early on that Dicky, was once a great fighter who beat Sugar Ray Lenard, but is now washed up and fighting a drug addiction. The struggle soon begins when Micky has to decide whether he is going to make a career for himself or keep living in the shadows of his family. Lots of great acting and an inspiring story ensue...<br/><br/>Around November and December of each and every year a whole bunch of films are released with the hopes of being nominated for an Oscar. ""The Fighter"" is one of those films that just watching the trailer you can smell the nominations cooking. It also doesn't hurt that this movie is based on actual events, which seems to be a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination. ""The Fighter"" is extremely lucky because it was released in December and is also based on true events. With that being said, I can't even begin to say that this film doesn't deserve the attention its getting. Sure, we have seen films about boxing before but its the acting and the story that makes the film really worth while.<br/><br/>Christian Bale went all ""Machinist"" in this film. He looked horrible and deathly ill. For those who don't know, Bale always gets into his roles and does what it takes to play the part. In ""The Fighter"" he was to play a washed up fighter with a crack addition and let me tell you that he played that role to perfection. I actually laughed when the film first started because Bale looked so sickly and obviously had to really starve himself to fit the role, while Wahlberg just looked like his normal built self. Bale pulled off the crack addition fighter role like a pro, from the talk to the actual look, he just nailed this role. Don't get me wrong, Mark Wahlberg did a great job as Micky Ward. It was just funny seeing how much Bale had to transform himself to fit the role and Wahlberg just looked like he normally does. Wahlberg really shows that he is a good actor here and shows he has what it takes to play a more serious roles. Wahlberg has always been known to play the sexy buff roles but most of his other films haven't had much substance. Micky has a lot of back story and really requires a lot from Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Along with Wahlberg and Bale, fighting for the better performance you have some great supporting roles in this film. Amy Adams is just terrific as Charlene and gives a really powerful and emotional performance. I like how her character is frowned upon in the film for the first half that she's almost like the villain but than turns into the voice of reason later in the film. Adams has always been a great actress but it takes films like ""The Fighter"" to really get someone noticed. She is nominated for a Golden Globe, which I hope she wins. She definitely deserves it. Another noteworthy supporting role is Melissa Leo, who I recently really enjoyed in ""Welcome to the Rileys."" She played Micky's mom in the film and I have to tell you really played the mean-spirited and over protective mother role to near perfection.<br/><br/>The film itself wouldn't have worked as well as it did if it wasn't for a strong director and script. The story is simple but what made the film work was the vision and how it was was brought to life from script to screen. David O. Russell normally doesn't direct films like this but its nice to see him step outside his norm to direct something a little more down to earth. The screenplay, which was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson really did a good job developing the characters but not only that delivered a lot of raw emotion as well. Its sad to say but very few recognize that it takes a lot of effect from a director and screenwriters to make a film great. Sure actors steal the spotlight but those people behind the scenes are the ones who make them truly great.<br/><br/>In the end, the story of ""The Fighter"" is a uplifting one filled with some great performances, a great screenplay, and some solid direction. Its probably going to win a lot of awards this season and I think it deserves some of that attention most notable Bale and Adams. Its not a groundbreaking film because its based on actual events but its a solid film nonetheless. In terms of sport films, its probably one of the best I have seen. I think anyone who likes real life dramas will really enjoy this film. I think its one of the better films of 2010.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Fighter"" is an 8 out of 10."

It's a very different movie from Russell's ""Huckabees,"" a film I adored, but yet his fingerprints are all over it, and its cast gels in the same exhilarating way that the cast of ""Huckabees"" did, sending you out on a high on the strength of the sheer talent on display.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"PopcornJury","Null","3","5","22 December 2010"," The Fighter is one of the best films of 2010, and one of the more inspiring comeback films in sports history.
","The Fighter is a riveting film that I can fully recommend. It isn't a film about the insane, innate nature of a perfectionist ballerina, a troubling tale of a man crushed beneath a rock, or a story of a man who falls in love with a woman with a life-threatening disease. It's the story of Mickey (played by Mark Whalberg) and Dickie (played by Christian Bale) a based-on-a-true-story tale of two brothers, both boxers, one on his way up, and one trying to keep from hitting rock bottom.<br/><br/>The Fighter chronicles the rise and fall of the Mickey and Dickie Ward, two brothers, and two boxers from Lowell Massachusetts. The spotlight should be on Mickey, the up and comer, but instead, all the attention is on Dickie, the star who once knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard, the one claiming to make a comeback, when in reality he's on his way down a path of drugs, danger and destruction. Dickie is a crack addict, a meth head, a barrier to entry. Mickey however, is intent on keeping him around. In the end, he's still his brother right?<br/><br/>Much of The Fighter revolves around the Ward family drama- a family with nine kids, two fathers, a money grubbing mother who doubles as a mess of a manager, and a brother who consistently brings the family down. Everything comes to a head when Dickie gets himself arrested and brings Mickey in a situation that nearly ends his boxing career. It's these moments that set the stage for one of the most inspiring comeback films in sports history. Everyone in the theater will be rooting for Mickey, not only during the scenes inside the ring, but even in the scenes outside of it.<br/><br/>Don't let the most recent trailers fool you. The Fighter doesn't offer anything that you'd find in a Disney sports film. While the movie does have moments that are extremely uplifting, the bulk of what you'll see here is pretty dark and disturbing. There's a ton of foul language, drug use, sex and violence. It's not an adult film, but it's not a feel-good film either. It borders the line perfectly between drama, action, and awe-inspiring. Plus it's pretty funny at times too.<br/><br/>Much like Natalie Portman in Black Swan, if there's one reason to see this film, it's to witness the truly unbelievable acting skills of Christian Bale. In his review, Capone of Ain't It Cool News writes, ""It's no secret that Bale is a terrific actor, but his performance as Dickie could not have been achieved by any other actor–pure and simple."" Thomas Leupp of Hollywood.com states, ""The Fighter is a gritty triumph, much more than just the 'Christian Bale Crackhead Movie."" The fact that people are even labeling it as the Christian Bale Crackhead Movie is a testament to his acting. The guy is completely dead-on as Dickie, the down and out drug addict, ex-boxer, big brother extraordinaire. We see the real Dickie at the end of the movie, and it only further establishes how successful Bale was in portraying his character on screen.<br/><br/>I can't recommend The Fighter enough. There's a ton of subplots, scenes, stories and characters that I didn't even touch on that are guaranteed to increase your appreciation and should most definitely increase your excitement for this film. There's only a handful of films that I would rank higher this year than The Fighter, and I don't think any of them are as accessible of a film. Take your friend, your family, your grandpa, or your girlfriend. This is a film that will knock you down, tear you apart, and bring you right back together again in the end.<br/><br/>Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com"

","<ul><li>The Fighter: A David O Russell picture and entry into the boxing genre starring Christian Bale, Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams, and Melissa Leo.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Fighter is based on the true story of boxer Mickey Ward, portrayed by Wahlberg, in 1990s Lowell, Massachusetts, and chronicles his gradual success to gaining the world light welterweight title with the coaching of his drug abusing brother Dicky, Christian Bale. On his path to pride and glory, Mickey faces conflicts that urge him to separate from the grasps of his managing and controlling family and earns extra backbone from his strong-minded girlfriend, Amy Adams. Granted, it doesn't sound exciting, but Russell's result here is one of the absolute best films of 2010. The Fighter, despite its many strengths, is undoubtedly a ""performance film."" Much of what makes it are the actors and what they put out on the screen, and the performances in The Fighter are all around excellent.<br/><br/>Christian Bale simply owns and walks away with the film, playing not a character, but becoming an individual. Bale is so engrossed in being Dicky Ecklund, capturing every essence of the damaged Bostonian crack addict, down to the mannerisms and daze. The performance is heartbreaking, goofily charming, and adept, with every emotion being conveyed powerfully and fully believable making for the best supporting performance of the year. Mark Wahlberg delivers the best performance of his career in this film as sympathetic and easy to cheer on Mickey and also the best movie quote I've heard in quite some time. Plus, with all of the research and preparation he went through to pinpoint Mickey, he's worth respecting. Amy Adams is most definitely a sure lock for best supporting actress and displays a very strong, tough, and amiable output as a character who should be grating, but never is. Another potential lock for best supporting actress is the always impressive Melissa Leo that has her hand on the likability switch as Mickey's mother and manager.<br/><br/>The Fighter is far from the standard sports melodrama. This is a film that has a fantastic ray of energy and exuberance throughout, with a hilariously delightful sense of humor that hits quick, the quirky Ecklund family, and a soundtrack selection that is lively and completely well chosen, with The Heavy's ""How You Like Me Now"" being the movie's anthem. The cinematography is jumpy and filmed mostly hand-held, an enticing style that places one right into the film.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a film that never delves into complete somberness, but rather serves a wonderful slice of life that is very raw and downplayed. It is a superb family drama on top of an effective boxing biopic. The boxing matches are filmed with the stylistic choice of having it look like an HBO special that truly works and feel very realistic. The boxing is overshadowed by the family elements, but the fights are some of the best moments of the film, taking the viewer through all the appropriate emotions. When Mickey wins a fight, you can't help yourself: You want to stand up and cheer.<br/><br/>The only major problem is in two aspects: The film does feel a bit long and the climactic ending match is nearly identical to an earlier fight in the film. That's about it. The Fighter is an incredible and dramatic picture that blends witty comedy with moving thematics and deep characters and puts a very welcome original twist on a familiar formula with a down to earth attitude, exemplary family dilemmas, a very skillful screenplay, and a sheer amount of entertainment that is difficult to gain from most other films of this genre."
"meeza","9","3","5","20 December 2010"," ""The Fighter"" is a winner!
","Ladies and gentlemen! It could very well be the main movie event of 2010! Weighing in at 114 minutes, packed with solid acting performances, and destined to be one of the best boxing character pictures of all time, ""The Fiiiiiighter""! Star and Executive Producer Mark Wahlberg bent over backwards for many years to get ""The Fighter"" in the cinematic ring. It was a project that was destined to be knocked out in developmental hell. Wahlberg took the hits but fought enough to get the film greenlighted, and then asked his good friend & collaborator David O. Russell to direct ""The Fighter"". Why not? Russell has been known to fight from time to time with his actors, just ask the legendary Lily Tomlin; the ""David vs. Actor Goliaths"" approach could have just been utilized when Wahlberg was able to recruit the feisty but outstanding actor Christian Bale to the project. ""The Fighter"" depicts the true story of Massachusetts boxer Mickey Ward, the Welterweight who in the mid-90's . I can't finish out that statement or else it will be a blow to your cinematic pleasure of enjoying ""The Fighter"". Ward was trained by his older half-brother Dicky Eklund, a former fighter himself who in 1978 knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard but then was knocked out himself by Sugar Crack Burner. Yea, he became a crack addict. Ward was managed by his controlling mother Alice, whose ""Alice in Fighterland"" management style are reminiscent of the Mommie Dearest uppercuts; OK, maybe not that bad but she vehemently insists for Mickey to be managed and trained by her circle of family & friends. One thing about Alice is that she was in Laborland plenty of times in her life by not only birthing Mickey & Dicky, but also six other sisters! Mickey falls for sexy bartender Charlene Fleming, who supports Mickey in his boxing career but feels it would be of benefit to him not to include his crack addict brother and his possessive mother in his entourage. Director David O. Russell and Screenwriters Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson effectively prioritize character development within this prized picture and just let boxing and its circle be the arena where the film's characters are exhibited in their highs & lows; either mentally, physically, or psychologically. In other words, ""The Fighter"" is more a character piece than a ""win at all cost"" hoorah boxing flick. Mark Wahlberg did not lack a punch with his well-balanced starring performance as Mickey Ward. Amy Adams tended the acting task quite admirably once more with her juicy performance as Charlene. Melissa Leo had the mother of all supporting actress performances of the year with her magnetic performance as momma manager Alice. But the ringleader of all the acting here was undoubtedly the stupendous work of the caped crusader himself Christian Bale. He totally embodied the character of Dicky Englund. Bale has been doing this for years in fully transforming himself to the characters he portrays. You don't believe me? Add to your Netflix Query ""American Psycho"", ""The Machinist"", and ""3:10 To Yuma"", if you have not seen these Bale classic performances already. All of these performances (especially Psycho) should have been nominated for Best Actor Oscars! I will give the Academy the benefit of the doubt there because of strong competition in those years, but I will not bail them out this year if Bale is not championed as the Best Supporting Actor. ""The Fighter"" may not come out on top as the best motion picture of the year, but it is still one viable worthy contender. ***** Excellent"
"blanbrn","10","3","5","19 December 2010"," A knockout. Emotionally raw a gripping family psychodrama that's passionate it ends with a soulful triumph.
","I must say ""The Fighter"" is clearly a knockout in fact one of the better films I've seen in awhile. And I'm not just saying that because it's a true story of an underdog from the sports world. This is a picture that has enough drama, conflict, sorrow, and courage, with determined passion that it will triumph the eyes of any viewer even if they aren't sports fans. The cinematography is first rate the way the fight scenes were portrayed with realism and fury. And the performances were top notch some of the best I've seen in a long time especially the work of Bale, Adams, and Leo's stand out.<br/><br/>If your not a boxing fan then you probably don't know the story of Mickey Ward the Lowell, Mass. working class guy who overcame many personal problems in life especially conflict with his family to become a welterweight champion. Well ""The Fighter"" is a near perfect film that captures the story just perfect as director David O. Russell really researched it well as this real life drama of rising stardom that's set near Beantown will leave you with a want to stand up cheering state of mind.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is Mickey Ward a local working stiff who struggles as a fighter as he's overshadowed by his older half brother a one time pride prize fighter named Dicky Eklund(brilliant and done in a believable way by Christian Bale). Mickey under the guidance of Dicky as his trainer takes some lumps even though Dick's training style is tough and admirable yet that is sunk under by his manager Mickey's own mother Alice(wicked and well done by Melissa Leo)and this is a lady with control issues she's to ego driven and very stubborn as she's clearly to domineering. And tragically on the side Dicky's main love is that of being an addicted chain smoking crack addict who smokes it up at a local rundown house in the Lowell projects. Finally his crazy and brash hobby leads him to go away for a prison stint. And here Mickey though hurt feels new light and direction in his ring journey with Eklund gone.<br/><br/>Now the most interesting and tasty part of the film which I call a wild card character is Charlene Fleming(played wonderful by the sexy and attractive Amy Adams). Charlene a local bar tender who's tough with outspoken lips becomes Mickey's new girlfriend as this little vixen is direct to the point and outspoken one girl that will be right beside Mickey as she will not back down from his tough as nails family as her and mother Alice engage in sassy mouth battles. This makes Charlene all that much more sexy as she's so erotically rugged and beautifully raw(and nice was seeing Amy Adams in a sexy see thru black bra!).<br/><br/>Thru all of this emotional drama of family pugilistic life Mickey endures the storm and makes up with mom and Dicky proving that it takes some dysfunction to triumph in the ring. Overall ""The Fighter"" is an excellent film not just of sports satisfaction, it's a rousing win for one's spirit and soul it proved that an underdog can win and find satisfaction despite being flawed with inner turmoil of family grief. All in all it scores a big knockout the cast will floor you with their performances. ""The Fighter"" is one film that has champion written all over it."
"gilligan-11","10","3","5","17 December 2010"," What makes a fighter
","Despite the inevitable comparisons to other movies about boxers (""Rocky,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and even ""The Wrestler""), ""The Fighter""—although its protagonist is a pugilist—would still be called ""The Fighter"" even if he weren't. The toughest of Micky Ward's fights do not occur in the ring—they occur with his family and himself. This is ultimately a film about fighting against the restraints that prevent us from achieving our potential (those self-imposed and those imposed by family members who claim to have our best interests in mind). Mark Wahlberg delivers what is probably the most understated and effective performance of his career, Christian Bale is astonishing as his crack-addicted brother who insists on perpetually reliving his own singular moment of boxing glory, Melissa Leo is amazingly detestable as their Medea of a mother, and Amy Adams—best known for playing meek, sweet, likable characters—displays impressive range as Micky's feisty supportive girlfriend who's battling some demons of her own. Everything about this film is utterly great—from the performances to the script to the directing of David O. Russell. ""The Fighter"" is, so far, my favorite movie of the year (and yes, I'm including ""Inception""), and I see Oscar nominations for everyone."
"imdb-3022","9","3","5","17 December 2010"," Plenty of out-of-the ring fights to enjoy
","Mark Wahlburg and director David O'Russell bring the amusement park that is the Ward/Eklund family to life with a brutal honesty that could have alienated their subjects and landed the two of them in court, if it weren't for the love they put into it. I live in the Boston area, and these are the truest characters I've ever seen in film, not just for the accents but also for the body language and all-around attitude. And you've gotta love 'em.<br/><br/>Christian Bale channels Dicky, whom Bale described in an interview as ""Tigger."" Don't be misled into thinking the title role is Micky, played with admirable restraint by Wahlburg. It is Dicky's film through and through. Bale's tragic/comic persona is a surprise and delight, and he forms the linchpin of this heroic tale.<br/><br/>If you don't like fights in the ring, that's fine, you'll like this movie anyway. There are plenty of other fights to enjoy. Melissa Leo slays everyone as the UberMom, and the catty sisters let it all rip. Amy Adams as Charlene claws to keep her man. In short, nobody pulls any punches, and if there was ever an Oscar-ready film, this is it."
"jgregg42","8","3","5","17 December 2010"," ""The Fighter"" is This Year's Strong Contender
","Do we need another boxing movie? After seeing several boxing films over the years they all seem the same. Take a story of a struggling boxer who will do anything for his shot at the title. Then through hard work and determination he earns his shot and he gets the girl. It seems like a cookie cutter format that audiences come to expect. So, do we need ""The Fighter?"" Yes we do.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" (directed by David O. Russell) is based on the true story of brothers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. And, if it weren't for the outstanding cast this would have been another boxing movie trying to make a buck.<br/><br/>We start the story in Lowell, Mass. in 1993. Dicky (played by Christian Bale) is being interviewed by an HBO film crew for a documentary about crack cocaine users in Lowell. All the while, Dicky has convinced himself that it is a documentary about his comeback. Back in the 1970s, Dicky was known as the ""Pride of Lowell"" for his boxing career. Thanks to Bale's ability to become the characters that he plays, the audience is taken on a journey. First we despise Dicky for his addiction. Then we tolerate him for his playfulness and lovability. Then finally we are cheering for his redemption.<br/><br/>This couldn't be an entire movie about a crack-head ex-boxer who redeems himself. At the start we are introduced to Dicky's brother Micky (played by Mark Wahlberg), who is known as a ""stepping stone,"" in boxing terms that means other boxers fight him to move up in their own careers. This role seems to fit Wahlberg quite well. In some of his other films he has an unintentional trademark of looking constantly perplexed. But, in this film his confused expressions play to his strength. Micky is being torn in several directions from his brother, his mother, his sisters and his new girlfriend, Charlene (played by Amy Adams). He needs to look confused throughout the story; he simply doesn't know who to trust.<br/><br/>While Dicky is training with Micky, their mother Alice (played by Melissa Leo) is managing Micky's career just the same as she managed Dicky's career. She smokes like a chimney and lives proudly with the fact that she managed Dicky in his prime while raising nine children.<br/><br/>Speaking of the nine children, the two brothers have seven sisters to contend with throughout the film. The casting for these seven women was perfect. It makes me wonder if a group of actresses could be nominated for Best Supporting Actress. These women made the film fun with their heavy, snide ""Bah-ston"" accents, wicked glares, tough-as-nails attitudes and their hair styles which looked like they needed building permits (after all it was 1993).<br/><br/>We see only one boxing match in the first half of the film. Russell wanted us to focus on Dicky's crack addiction, Micky's struggle to find balance in his life and Alice's determination to get her sons known in the boxing world. At the turning point in the film, Dicky becomes incarcerated and Micky takes on a new manager and drops Dicky as his trainer. He employs Mickey O'Keefe who was the real life mentor for Micky. We are finally introduced to a montage of fights where Micky works his way up to and finally given his shot at the title.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Yes. Not only for the story, but because you can see about 12 performances of actors and actresses that were made for these roles. Russell was able to bring out the strengths of each one of the cast. In return he gives the audience a film that felt new even if we have seen it before."

","I still don't understand how this movie is rated 8.1. It's ridiculous. From a boxing point of view this is the worst movie ever made (and, unfortunately, not only from a boxing point of view....). I think the actors trained no more than a couple of hours before shooting the scenes. The match with Sanchez is simply unbelievable. The actors don't even TRY to look real! I don't know which movies you usually watch to give these ratings. I'm sorry to write this review because i liked Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale in their other movies. This time, from my personal point of view, they made a mess. I wasn't even able to watch it till the end. The director should be forced to watch Rocky and Raging Bull nonstop until he realize his total lack of professionalism. don't waste your time and money on this!!"

","The bottom line-I just didn't care about anything that happened in this movie, nothing.<br/><br/>Why? Dicky- a has been drug addicted boxer was terribly portrayed here.

We never find out jack about his drug addiction apart from a TV show about his life.....why was so many things left out in this film?<br/><br/>Mickey-a momma's boy who does not act like a boxer in the ring and casually struts about getting bashed to hell then suddenly, manages to KO an opponent with a liver shot. I can't stress enough how badly the choreographed fight scenes were, absolutely pathetic. They barely touch each other.<br/><br/>Annoying mother, a bunch of ugly sisters that just seem to lurk about the family house....this film was TERRIBLE.

"kalel41","9","4","8","29 December 2010"," I believe Christian Bale will finally win an Oscar, long overdue.
","""The Fighter"" is based on a true story of a man and his quest to become a Boxing champion. It is the story of struggle, love and family but most importantly it is a story of two brothers, Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. In 1978 Dicky fought an excellent match against Sugar Ray Leonard and lost after a unanimous decision. He ended up being called ""The Pride of Lowell"" thereafter. His younger brother Micky followed in his footsteps and attempted to do what Dicky couldn't do. Set in the working class town of Lowell, Massachusetts ""The Fighter"" chronicles their story and the story of the Ward family. The performances in this film were the highlight for me; all the actors are truly fantastic. Mark Walberg gives his best performance since ""Boogie Nights"". Amy Adams shines and gives a very confident and gritty performance. Melisa Leo plays the mother and manager of Micky and she is unapologetic and in your face, very intimidating to watch. However, the clear stand out for me was Christian Bale as Dicky. He always gives 110 percent but he doesn't break for a second in this film and his performance is mind blowing. He is well over due for an Oscar and I think he will finally win it this year. The actors are working with an excellent scrip by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson. The dialogue feels raw and real and the actors bring out every nuance in their delivery. Director David O Russell knows exactly how to steer them and the film. He presents us with a very different sports film then one might think. The Ward family dynamic is so good I cringed while watching them go at each other verbally and physically. I almost felt embarrassed for them, I would shake my head in disapproval of their actions. Some great situational comedy ensues from this. The Fighter is a dramatic character piece set against the Boxing world as its backdrop. It may star Mark Walberg with Christian Bale giving an Oscar worthy performance but the audience is the winner here. This film is dark, witty, touching and one of the best films of the year.

"karakovacs47","5","2","3","11 July 2014"," Why Does Everyone Love This Movie
","I watched this movie because everyone said I had to. That it was amazing, was such an inspiring story, and that Christian Bale was awesome in it. I'll give them that. He did a good job. But everything else was disappointing. There was no emotion in the entire movie. I didn't feel anything the entire time. In the end, when Micky won the fight, I didn't even care. There was nothing leading up to it, nothing to make me excited about it. <br/><br/>The entire movie was a downer, everybody hated each other and complained all the time. Amy Adams, who is normally beautiful looked terrible. Melissa Leo somehow won an Oscar (??!!) for her role, when she didn't have a challenging, significant nor sizeable role in the film. She didn't have many lines, and had the oh-so-difficult role of being a rude person and a bad mother. <br/><br/>The character development was a disaster. Christian's character did a complete 180 in the blink of an eye, and all the other characters were the exact same the whole movie.<br/><br/>Finally, Mark. Mark Wahlberg has done some great work. His performance in the Departed was outstanding. But in the Fighter he was boring, dumb, and lacked emotion. <br/><br/>All in all, I felt I owed it to anyone that hasn't seen it to give them the other perspective, since majority of these reviews are positive. Don't watch it."

","Maybe I came into this film with too much excitement. Maybe my expectations were too high. I don't know what it was but The Fighter was a disappointment in my eyes.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of Mark Wahlberg. I don't see any depth in any of his work. I could understand why girls love seeing him in films but as an artist of cinema, I don't see it. I see an actor when I look at him. I don't see a character.<br/><br/>The absolute low point of this film is the choreographed fight scenes. They were terrible! The camera was not shot at the right angle for many punches and the punches thrown were really unrealistic. Very disappointed.<br/><br/>The only good point of this film I enjoyed was Christian Bale. I could see he really did his homework for this one. His mannerisms were spot on and I love when actors lose/gain weight for a film. It really brings the realism to the screen. When I looked at the character, I didn't see Christian Bale....I saw Dicky Eklund!<br/><br/>This film does not even comes close to Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and one the of the all time greats, Raging Bull."
"swaindominic","5","2","3","13 June 2011"," Surprisingly disappointing
","I had high hopes for The Fighter, not only due to the praise which was lavished on it, but also because I loved 'I heart Huckabees'. I know that was a film which polarised opinion, but I thought it was inventive, intelligent, funny and excellently written. I was therefore expecting The Fighter to provide something new. Perhaps expecting David O'Russell to take the boxing movie genre in a completely new direction was asking too much, but I did expect to find unique elements for a film of this kind.<br/><br/>What I saw was a film full of cliché and caricature. I didn't find it very compelling or exciting; instead I found it to be flat and frequently annoying. It was like O'Russell found a book of 'fighting movie clichés' and made sure he included them all. We get the traditional training montage played out to cheesy rock music - something that has been seen, and parodied, many times before. What about the other boxing cliché classic of several fights shown as a highlights package to chart the protagonist's rise up the ranks? Oh yes, O'Russell includes that as well. I actually couldn't believe my eyes that this was felt to be the best way to tell the story. Surely they could have come up with something more original!<br/><br/>I understand that it's the characters being portrayed that are annoying; however, some of them are like cartoon caricatures and infuriating to watch. The gaggle of aggressive sisters were the worst by far. They were not funny or interesting, they had no emotion, no depth and nothing for me to connect with. Amy Adams played Charlene very well, but again I found her to be an aggressive stereotype and I couldn't connect with her character. The scenes with the sisters, Alice and Charlene arguing were cringe-worthy. I can watch old re-runs of the Jerry Springer show if I'm into that kind of 'banter' but it brought nothing of worth to the film.<br/><br/>That brings me on to Melissa Leo as Alice Ward. She landed an Oscar and received much praise for her performance. I have to say that this was a solid, and certainly strong performance, but I don't think it comes close to being worthy of an Oscar. It was one dimensional and abrasive and never gave us a chance to see the woman behind the stern exterior. She stomps around moodily, cigarette in hand, dishing out barrages of f- bombs, and not much more. I couldn't find any depth, or motives, she seems like a cartoonish comedy character and not something to be taken seriously. Maybe we can blame the screenplay – but I think her performance really lacks something, which I look for in really great acting.<br/><br/>So then, what about Dicky and Micky surely they are the heart of the film and the ones who matter. I like Mark Wahlberg a lot and I don't think this his performance as Micky Ward is a bad one, but it rumbles along but never soars. I think it's more of a problem with the screenplay than the acting. I just didn't care about Micky enough to get into the film. After all, he is what this story is about and it is a failing of the film that you never get to see anything that lies behind the mask of bravado worn by this 'tough man'. What drives Micky on? What does he care about? We get glimpses perhaps, but never enough to flesh out the character so we can truly empathise with him. Having said that, the film hooked me in just enough during the last 20 minutes to root for Micky in his big fight, but prior to that I didn't become engaged with what was going on.<br/><br/>Christian Bale also took home an Oscar for his performance as Dicky, and whilst it was good I felt it was lacking heart. Yet again, this is partly to do with the screenplay. The drug addict and unreliable brother who comes good in the end is perhaps another cliché, but one that can be used effectively if it's done well. I though Bale was good, don't get me wrong, but I was left feeling that there was no emotional depth to the character that would give the audience something to care about. Having said that, there is a short scene at the end of the film where Bale showed true emotional depth and it was certainly pitch-perfect acting. But, 10 seconds of engaging and heartfelt acting doesn't warrant an Oscar. Maybe I'm being harsh on Bale but after what I had read about this film I was expecting a lot more. For example, I think he is much better in The Machinist (and I'm not referring to the weight loss method acting, I'm referring to the heart of the performance).<br/><br/>It may seem like I've totally slated the film but I'm not saying that it's awful. I just think it falls well short of the hype that surrounded it during awards season. I can't see how it deserved nominations for best film or best director. Overall it's OK, I think it's worth watching but it's not something I would choose to see again. It had a few decent moments, but overall there is no meaning. Essentially it contains a lot of angry people shouting at each other for long periods, interspersed with average boxing scenes. It's hard to care about the characters and I think it pushes away any real connection a viewer can have with the story. The last 20 minutes were a bit better but that wasn't enough to redeem it in my eyes. I think it could have been so much better, and in the end I was very disappointed. Obviously enough people loved the film, so I guess it's still worth giving it a go, but as far as I'm concerned it's average and not an award-winning film. 5/10"
"enntous","7","2","3","10 March 2011"," Good flick, but doesn't live up to the hype
","The movie is a solid one, a great deal of emotions going around, a well defined plot, a somehow happy ending,a lovely underdog to root for and above all it casts great actors. Unlucklily good news end here for this movie, in fact when you watch it there's a strong feeling of deja vue all over the place and you Begin strongly to suspect how it's gonna end up. In other words you have the impression to be watching just another Rocky copycat, just this time he speaks with a funny Boston accent. If a friend asked me an advice whether to watch it or not, i would have said: go to the cinema, but do not expect a lot from it. You won't leave disappointed but you'll understand why somebody else got the Oscar for best picture."
"Eumenides_0","7","2","3","25 February 2011"," Christian Bale Saves Predictable Movie
","Boxing movies are predictable. Drug addiction movies are predictable. Inspiring true stories are predictable. My next sentence is very predictable: The Fighter is annoyingly predictable.<br/><br/>But it's an enjoyable movie. Storytelling clichés aside, The Fighter triumphs as a heartbreaking movie about family relationships. When it's focusing on the protagonist and his large dysfunctional family it provides some of the best dramatic scenes of any movie this year. The filmmakers must have known that because they thankfully keep the boxing almost in the background in order to tell a very human story.<br/><br/>Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a boxing fighter with a low reputation. Coached by his crack head brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), a former fighter and a local legend in their hometown of Lowell for once having knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard, he sees the years fly by as he fights in crappy matches that get him money but don't get him anywhere near his dream of having a shot at the title. Dicky and their mother (Melissa Leo), who acts as Micky's manageress, are, to put it mildly, incompetent in the way they manage his career.<br/><br/>Dicky has a serious drug addiction problem and can't see reality in front of him. This is made obvious when he lets an HBO crew make a documentary about him. Dicky claims they're filming his comeback, but in fact they're doing a piece on crack addicts. Dicky is too stoned most of the time to realise in Lowell people consider him a loser.<br/><br/>Micky's mother, Alice, worships Dicky. Dicky is always the centre of attentions. As the movie develops Micky deals with his self-esteem problem and finally finds the courage to break away from his mother's good-intentioned control and to move from under Dicky's shadow.<br/><br/>The Fighter entertained me but I never had the impression I was watching a great movie. A good ensemble of actors helps hide the fact that the direction is uninspired and the writing and storytelling clichéd. In fact some clichés just got on my nerves. I see them so often in boxing movies that I feel they should just put a moratorium on this genre until a super-screenwriter comes up with a new model to tell this type of stories.<br/><br/>Cliché number one: the inspiring speech at the end. We all know how the final fight plays out, right? We visualised it in our minds two hours in advance. We've seen the Rocky movies, Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, even movies with Jean-Claude Van Damme. The protagonist is getting devastated by the opponent, he's giving up, but then he remembers something inspiring someone tells him, and bam, some massive surge of energy springs from within the deepest corner of his soul and it turns the tide of the fight in two seconds. It's a Knockout. We have a winner! Boring.<br/><br/>Cliché number two: the final opponent is always a jerk. Now Micky is the protagonist, we're supposed to like him, of course. But we've been liking him for almost two hours now. Must we really demonise his opponent, some guy called Shea Neary? Micky is a nice, polite dude. What about Neary? He's rude, he doesn't greet Micky in the ring. OK. Look, we already like Micky by now. We've already laughed and cried with him. We really want to see him become world champion. He could deliberately run over a dog and we'd still want him to win at this point. Turning the movie into a simple good vs. bad fight is futile. In real life Neary was probably just like Micky, he just wanted to fight box and win the title. Now is it too much to ask the filmmakers to respect my intelligence and not assault me with these third-rate ploys to win my sympathy? But as I said, when the movie isn't about boxing it's very good. Christian Bale steals the show with his portrayal of Dicky. Famous for his physical transformations and superb accents, Bale just disappears into his characters. He's one of the rare actors who doesn't need make-up. His performance is full of vitality and little ticks – he's so good he can capture the viewer's attention just with the fidgeting of his hands or the twitching of his eyes. Loud and electric, Bale plays the most interesting character in the movie. As warm as Micky's triumph may be, what I really loved was to watch Dicky fighting his addiction.<br/><br/>His addiction results in the best sequence in the movie. Dicky has been arrested. He's in prison. The crack documentary is showing on TV. He watches it with a crowd of inmates. Alice watches it with Dicky and Micky's sisters. Micky watches alone at home. Dicky sees the people of Lowell calling him an embarrassment and accusing him of giving the town a bad name. It's devastating, moving and cruel at the same time to see each family member, glued to the TV screen, reacting in their different way to it.<br/><br/>Micky's arc isn't nearly as interest or poignant but Wahlberg does a fine job. Yes, he's the weakest link the movie but his unpretentious, down-to-earth acting works in his favour when portraying such a simple and likable guy like Micky. More disappointing were Melissa Leo and Amy Adams, whom I expected at any moment to reveal the reasons why they earned Oscar nominations for this. Their greatness, however, if they had any, eluded me.<br/><br/>Even with its seven Oscar nominations, I doubt in a few years anyone remembers The Fighter except Christian Bale fans. 2010 will definitely be remembered as the year of the overrated movies."
"paudie","Null","2","3","24 February 2011"," The fighter and his family
","There have been plenty of movies about professional boxing, both biographical and fictional. The Fighter is a very worthwhile addition to that list. It is based on the life of Micky Ward(Mark Wahlberg), a boxer from Massachusetts. He is a gutsy fighter with some potential but fears he may have missed his chance at the big time. He is trained by his half-brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), who still tries to live off the fame of knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard over ten years before. His mother (Melissa Leo) manages Ward rather poorly; signing him for fights he cannot win. She is a larger than life figure who treats Eklund as her favourite son. She ignores that Eklund is a drug addict and this is reducing Ward's chance of success. Eventually Eklund's lifestyle causes him to end up in jail.<br/><br/>However Ward, an easygoing man, is slow to rock the boat until he starts going out with a local barmaid (Amy Adams). She sees both his potential and the way he is being badly treated by his family. With her support he confronts them and tells them he is getting a new manager. Suffice it to say his mother does not take this too well.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie charts Ward's increasing success and what happens when Eklund is released from prison.<br/><br/>The performances are generally excellent. Christian Bale has rightly received plaudits for playing Eklund. A youtube search shows that his portrayal of him as a rather annoying non-stop talker is pretty accurate! Wahlberg is highly impressive in the less flashy role of Ward. He accurately portrays his frustration at the way his career is fading as well as his love for his family members who are causing that to happen. I thought Melissa Leo played the mother as an almost cartoonish character and this grated slightly with me. If she is as she comes across in the film in real life she must be impossible to live with! Her brood of daughters are similarly portrayed as being intimidating to say the least.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes are shown as if they are appearing on a TV screen and I found this, as well as the excellent fight choreography, made the scenes very authentic"
"MarcusJ13","8","2","3","14 February 2011"," Excellent for the genre
","Many boxing films I have noticed get positive receptions and I enjoy so as you can imagine I had great optimism going into it. Micky Ward is not a household name but of course he doesn't need to be a household name for this to be a good film. The film itself was very good and the thing that impressed me was the pacing. I liked Raging Bull for example but I did believe there were problems with the pacing and sort of dragged. This film didn't and they kept it to a premium very well knowing what what was required and didn't in my view anyway have too much padding. All of the roles were played well, his sisters were portrayed in a very over the top way but I didn't begrudge it too much because they didn't have a huge amount of screen time for the characters they are.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg did a great job with the understated mild mannered performance which had us empathising with the character but not in a way that felt clichéd about the humble rags to riches character that of course we've all seen before. He does well overall but I am not the first to say this but Christian Bale really does steal the show. It is probably the film I've seen him perform the best in. He plays it brilliantly and doesn't go over the top like the sister characters seem to because he plays it that well. There is an element of tragedy about the character as we see about the HBO documentary about crack addiction. He even manages to have some amusing moments without coming across as too goofy. Knowing about the sort of performance Dicky demanded I thought he may get too goofy but he manages to have some slightly comedic moments as well as portraying a flawed individual as well. Inspite of his flaws I still like the character of Dicky which could have failed in the respect of him being the sort of individual he was at least in the film. I don't know how much they changed him if at all I'm only going by what I saw. It may sound like the film is all about him and its not we see plenty of Micky Ward and the way he likes to conduct himself which ultimately isn't underplayed. It was also done well in that we do not just see Micky as a punching bag (no pun intended) for these problems. Its not as if they're just saddling continuous hurdles on him which they could have done if they felt it made it more interesting. I notice sometimes filmmakers do this in order to make the story more compelling and I don't think they do that here. They keep it interesting and not cringe-worthy. The boxing scenes were decent but I have seen better boxing scenes from films before. These served their purpose well and didn't fail at attempting artsy techniques which I really could have imagined them doing. Is it the best boxing film of all time? Probably not but makes for a very good film on its own which served up good performances all round."
"mm-39","7","2","3","14 February 2011"," Okay movie.
","The Fighter is a movie that one has to see more than once. One will pickup more details from a second screening. The acting is strong. Everyone played their characters perfectly. I found some of the characters extremely annoying, which made a few scenes hard to watch. The protagonist's mother and dysfunctional brother were very hard to watch. It seemed that these two characters were all about themselves. The story is based from real life. I find real life stories more entertaining than fiction. The movie is well directed, and has no slow spots. I cannot believe how much weight Christian Bale lost for this role! I give The fighter a 7 out of 10."
"bartireid","8","2","3","8 February 2011"," Blood Is Thicker Than Glory
","The key to success of most sports drama's is in its ability to capture a binding quintessence of both sport and hero or heroine. Boxing in itself embodies a wealth of humanistic teachings such as resilience, endurance and discipline. In the case of David O Russells biopic The Fighter manages to broaden the parallel past the notion of one man's fight into gripping family drama, a statement of brotherly and motherly love, galvanised by the thematic complexities of obscured loyalties and conflicted priorities.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg leads the line as Pro Boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward, an embattled soldier like man of noble but crushed spirit, who we meet at a cross roads in his seemingly mediocre career. Wahlberg's performance bares shades of the hapless loss of control that eventually evolves in Boogie Nights (1997) as well as the bulldog spirit of Invincible (2006). Early in the film the question is raised about the validity of his tutelage. Ward is governed by a coalition of blood firstly inside the ring with star of the show Christian Bale, playing brother Dicky a decayed local boxing legend turned trainer, whose life is in near terminal free fall through Crack addiction and accompanying petty criminality. Bale gives by far the most authentic performance of his career, an emotionally rangy tour de force, maneuvering through Dick Eklunds crippling self destruction.<br/><br/>Outside the ring Melissa Leo in her portrayal of mother Alice Ward attempts at being the matriarchal adhesive that must forge Family and Business, whilst a pack of Hyena like sisters also seem to be feasting from Micky's trough. The disorganised managerial set up soon becomes an unsuspecting triumvirate when an incredulous Wahlberg falls in love with Amy Adams who plays a Charlene, a tough talking waitress eager to apply her own wisdom and perspective to the situation roundly rejected by the rest of the Ward clan. These performances provide the foundation for the feature, complimenting each other leaving sparks flying around the screen with Wahlberg's pathos comes Bales preposterousness whilst Leo's motherly devotion is countered by Adam's divisibility.<br/><br/>Beyond the character study is an effective social commentary as the Ward/Eklund family are products of their drab and at times oppressive surroundings of Lowell, Massachusetts. Boxing is an outlet for many to lash out in a controlled environment, whilst those who don't submit to the temptations of drug addiction, alcoholism and crime. <br/><br/>Other iconic Boxing films of differing eras will no doubt draw comparison but we aren't romanticising as in Rocky (1976) or partaking in the savage poetry of Raging Bull (1980). The Fighter finds a place of its own within the pantheon of great Boxing pictures telling a story both of and for its time.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Jonathon_Natsis","8","2","3","6 February 2011"," As far as the Academy Awards go
","I wouldn't be all too surprised to see The Fighter emerge as the ultimate dark horse closer to the ceremony, en route to winning Best Picture. I don't dispute that some almost unbeatable competition stands in its way. Critic-friendly films The King's Speech and The Social Network are the undisputed frontrunners, while I feel Black Swan may be too intense, and perhaps too ambiguous, to be a force. Meanwhile, other quality films such as Inception and Toy Story 3 are made almost redundant since they haven't been recognised in the directing department. But The Fighter has the sort of emotional and thematic drive that can give a film both mass appeal, and respect from those who matter come awards season.<br/><br/>David O. Russell directs two actors in the prime of their carers in Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. They play aspiring boxing champion Micky Ward, in the earlier stages of his career, and his crack-addicted half-brother Dicky Eklund, respectively. Micky is a promising prospect, but one that gets repeatedly screwed by last-minute card changes, suffering repetitive losses and beatdowns all in the name of earning a living. That is until he is offered a chance to train with a new crew, where he faces the decision of cutting his ties with anyone weighing him down, including his own family.<br/><br/>In short, that is what makes The Fighter so engaging. Yes, it contains all the elements of a typical boxing film: hard work is the only way to achieve your goal, reaching the pinnacle despite adversity, and all that. But the family dynamics constantly on display, arguing that professional boxing is every bit as mental and interpersonal as it is physical, give this film the emotional drive I mentioned above, which really drives it home in the Third Act.<br/><br/>The cast does an amazing job as a unit in this film. Despite having the lead role, Wahlberg does occasionally get overshadowed by his co-stars, but that's no reflection on his performance. He is impressive; others just happen to be even better. Bale is almost a shoe-in for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. If that sounds a little premature, wait for the footage of the real Dicky Eklund during the end credits. Bale's ability to perfectly mimic his accent, mannerisms and general demeanour is nothing short of freakish.<br/><br/>Melissa Leo is every bit as good as the brothers' domineering, omnipresent mother. She is at her best when using her passive-aggressive side to get her way against her husband and sons. Some may argue that, occasionally, she is portrayed as excessively unpleasant or vindictive to the extent that she has no compassion for the wellbeing of her family. This does detract from some scenes, especially since, at least in my opinion, she ultimately has the interests of her sons at heart. And Amy Adams, although not having quite the same impact as her fellow supporting actors, also does enough to earn a nomination in her own right as Micky's girlfriend.<br/><br/>Finally, The Fighter possesses an excellent soundtrack, filled to the brim with foot-tapping rock and roll from artists including Led Zeppelin, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and The Heavy. Honourable mentions go to the use of Whitesnake's Here I Go Again as Micky walks to the ring in what is an indulgent piece of camera-work, as well as The Rolling Stones' Can't You Hear Me Knocking for an inspired training montage. So give The Fighter a shot. You may find yourself not only entertained, but also feeling the urge to buy a pair of boxing gloves, get in shape and get your own MTV girlwhatever that is.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"kunalkhandwala","9","2","3","5 February 2011"," Certainly packs a winning punch
","The inspiring story of an underdog who reaches the limit of physical and psychological brutality to achieve the ultimate title of a champion, makes Boxing movies such as 'Raging Bull' ,'Rocky' and 'Million Dollar Baby' the worthy Oscar legends. But beyond the conventional premise of the underdog, the true story of Micky Ward of Lowell, Massachusetts deals with the battle against his blue-collar family whose sheer incompetence and obstinate approach leave him beaten and bruised. Micky is exceptional because his tougher mental and psychological fights are against adversaries who are closest to him. The Fighter is not only director David O Russell's finest work but also the fruit of Mark Wahlberg's relentless pursuit of the Ward story as a producer and actor. <br/><br/>Micky is trained by his half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), the pride of Lowell, who, with his wide open eyes, Irish-American accent and inflated pride, walks around town as the legendary boxer who knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard (who may have tripped and fallen) while his footage is being covered by HBO for a supposed documentary marking his return to boxing. On one hand, Micky is faced with his trainer who is unashamedly untimely and unprofessional due to crack addiction and on the other, he is 'managed' by his obdurate mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), who inevitably wastes his chances in the arena with all the wrong/unfair matches he is coerced into. His only respite is with the beautiful but unabashed bartender, Charlene, whom his sisters detest as an 'MTV girl'. In Charlene's companionship, Micky finds hope to make it to the big league and an escape from the madness that is the Ward household. Charlene's adamant goal for Micky becomes an unlikely match for Alice's authority over his career and while their confrontations are intense, they also provide the entertainment through the stupidity of the Ward sisters, who in the background, are a loud and obtuse hippie bunch. <br/><br/>After an ugly row with the Police, Ricky is imprisoned and in his absence, Micky enters the arena with a new trainer, professional manager, dedicated lover and skills passed on by Ricky to finally seek his shot at the title.<br/><br/>The film is as brilliantly poised in the ring, as it is outside of it. Through some magnificent performances, we are able to feel some emotion for each of the characters. Amy Adams as the beautiful Charlene, has a practical understanding of Micky's predicament and that makes her character lovable. Melissa Leo as Alice portrays an authoritative tenacity that is easy to hate while the sisters provide the unsophisticated, uneducated look at the whole situation. Mark Wahlberg went through a transformation to get into Micky Ward's character. Both physically and psychologically, he portrays a range of emotions his character goes through and is subjected to. After sustaining 5-6 rounds of beating in the ring, he delivers one decisive blow to knock out the opponent. This is what he learnt from Ricky and this is what he showcases to us as an actor. He grows with every scene within the movie itself. Then again, this is what he does best. Sturdy and focused, he fights all odds to emerge victorious. But the exemplary performance has to be that of Christian Bale. He is actually Incredible as Ricky Eklund. He quickly erases any memory of the Machinist or Bruce Wayne and walks into the loose shoes of the swagger whose pride is hammered down by HBO's documentary on crack addiction. Being used to placid characters so far, he transforms into this heavily accented, slim and blunt character whose demeanor and eccentric ways can only be overshadowed by the athlete in him that eventually trains Micky to surpass even the best fighters. This has to be the best performance of Bale's career. <br/><br/>Recollection of older boxing films is inevitable when it comes to the fight scenes but as Micky and Ricky walk to the ring to the signature tune of Whitesnake's Here I go Again, the anticipation mounts and thereafter, Russell and the cinematographer deliver each punch with the harmony of agonizing jolts. For those who grew up with posters of 'Rocky' in their rooms, The Fighter sure as hell, packs a winning punch!<br/><br/>8.835 on a scale of 1-10."

","THE FIGHTER – CATCH IT ( A ) The Fighter is truly a pleasant surprise for me as wrestling or boxing movies have never been my forte but it's good to see that it's more about dramatic dysfunctional family rather than just Boxing. The True story of Irish Mickey Ward and his brother Dick ""Dicky"" Ecklund is a really inspiring. The best thing about the movie is that its fast paced and clever, there are no loose or slow moments in the movie. Mark Wahlberg played Mickey Ward with utmost dedication and essence. Christian Bale, what an actor he is, in every movie he becomes the character and in 5 seconds we completely forget that he is the BATMAN. He not only lost his weight for the role but he also lost sophistication too, which was highly required for Dicky Ecklund. He truly deserves all the awards and accolades.. Besides Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, the women of ""The Fighter"" are also the True Fighters. O'God Melissa Leo is Spot On as Agonizing Mother; she looked so effing real that it's unbelievable. Its not like we haven't see roles like that it's just What Melissa Leo brought to the role was Commendable. Amy Adams yet again gave a brilliant performance as Mickey Ward's girl friend. The way she stand up in front of Mickey's mom and painful 7 bit*h sisters was Outstanding. Whenever she opened her mouth it amazed it. Bravo! The Se7en sisters were fun to watch. Overall, The Fighter is a Crazy Dramatic look into the life of Mickey Ward. Highly Entertaining. Must catch it!"

","It was simply superb movie directed as it has to be. Christian Bale is at his best as he performed in the past. His body speaks the character and he spoke for the role. This movie deserves 2010's Oscar Best movie award and stands atop on all other movies. Mark Wahlberg has given immaculate performance as 'The Fighter'. Screenplay of the movie was well done, no part of the movie was left unjustified and the movie flows based on the story that happened. The title as says 'The Fighter' remains as the lead role is going to be a fighter, in the same lines it is how the fighter succeeded in the end because of his trainer/brother. Christian Bale deserves Best Supporting Actor award for 2010 at Oscars this year."

","The Fighter is a skilfully fluid film, responding to a broad storyline by nimbly adapting soundtrack, dialogue, pace and cinematography throughout.<br/><br/>Coupled with a realism that lends itself to laughing, shouting, gasping and shaking ones head in all the right places, this makes it a very clever piece of film-making.<br/><br/>Whilst obviously being a movie about two boxers, it is in equal parts an intense brotherly-relationship drama, a social commentary on crack addiction, a light-hearted comedy... each part reaching out to a potential segments of the audience.<br/><br/>Predictable although suspenseful, the story leans on strong acting and dialogue to satisfy. From the opening moments, Bale is utterly convincing as the eccentric fallen-from-grace half of the duo.<br/><br/>Amy Adams plays a difficult role, although 'adorably encouraging' slipped into 'insensitively irritating' in a couple of places.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Wahlberg's character is less developed and less challenging, accounting for a functional but uninspiring performance.<br/><br/>An energetic trad-rock soundtrack neatly signposting changes in fortune and pace makes up for some disappointingly unbelievable fight scenes, which although well shot and choreographed have definitely had the Hollywood 'hero treatment'.<br/><br/>Overall, worth a watch for Bale's performance and a great soundtrack alone - with lots of other bonuses for the ride."
"patrickmbrame","9","2","3","22 January 2011"," Superbly Acted, Inspiring, and Uplifting.
","Even though after watching the trailer for The Fighter I knew essentially the whole story and how it ended (the reason I only gave it a 9 was the predictability of the story), I was still thoroughly entertained for the duration. And this can mainly be credited to the strong performances for really the whole cast. <br/><br/>Bale is a shoe in for an Oscar. Already got the golden globe, and I don't see anyone else even coming close to his performance. Aside from Bales physical appearance like his drop in weight, at the end of the film, during the credits,they have the real Mickey and Dickey, and Bale is almost a damn clone of the real Dickey. The performance is so strong, you pretty much hate Dickey for a lot of the film, yet you feel almost sorry for him in a pathetic kind of way, and then end up cheering for him towards the end.<br/><br/>Wahlberg gives possibly his best performance of his career. This was a great move for him because lately he's been having a lot of duds. Personally I thought he wasn't even all that good in The Good Guys and that was probably his best film since The Departed. <br/><br/>The two female leads, Amy Adams plays Wahlberg's girlfriend and Melissa Leo who plays his Mom and Manager, are great as well. Adams is great as the strong, inspiring girlfriend that gets Wahlberg out from the hole that is his family, but that's no surprise. And Leo will be getting some good roles coming her way, she was the least likable character on the screen, somewhat similar to Amy Ryan's Mom in Gone Baby Gone. <br/><br/>As for O'Russell he did a great job directing the film, especially with his choice of cinematography. The majority of the film is filmed with hand held cameras, giving it a very documentary and realistic feel. He also takes real home videos of the Dickey and Mickey as well as cutting to real rights from HBO to make the story that much more authentic, creating an even more heartfelt experience for the audience always being reminded that this is a true story. During the actual boxing matches he uses footage from HBO and the only voices that can be heard are the crowds and announcers placing you in real time with the match, unexpectedly watching. <br/><br/>Overall its a phenomenal character story, driven by the actors and actresses. The story is predictable, yet I almost cheered myself a couple of times during the matches. It definitely worth a watch, especially if your a Christian Bale fan, its an unbelievable performance and without a doubt the Oscar winner for best supporting actor. I would see it again and recommend you do as well, at least once."
"TombRaider09","Null","2","3","22 January 2011"," The initial depression turns into hope and victory
","**this review contains only light spoilers**<br/><br/>The Fighter is one of those films that you see for its stars, not because they are stars but because their performances were raved about. As a story, this based-on-true-story boxing drama has a lot to say about use, abuse, negligence and growing up, even if you are ""not getting any younger"".<br/><br/>Micky (Wahlberg) has been a professional fighter for his whole life, much like his brother Dicky (Bale) in a miserable small town of Lowell, where Dicky spends most of his time in a crack house, to which the brothers' mother/manager Alice (Leo) keeps a blind eye. But Dicky is not the only one abusing something, in his case substances, Alice remains unaware of how she abuses Micky's career and self-confidence by offering only fights where he can lose and pave the way for others to win. <br/><br/>Not until Micky sets his eyes on a straight talking, college drop-out bartender Charlene (Adams) that he learns exactly how stagnating his life has become. Recognizing Micky's potential, Charlene takes the reigns and nudges Micky towards the right path. <br/><br/>In this film the roles of villains and heroes shift, except for Micky who is a constant, the person who fights for what is right. But being unaware of their own and each others' motives, the emotional baggage they have harbored for each other reach the surface. <br/><br/>In a scene which will most likely be remembered by all, Alicia finds out that Micky has opted for another manager, effectively firing her. In a family where family comes first, Alicia and her what must be at least ten daughters pack into a small car to confront Micky and Charlene. In a hilarious cat fight, Charlene defends Micky and punches one of the daughters right in the face and it is Micky who has to stop the fight. Which is irony at its best. But quickly the humor turns into drama, when Alicia can only look at her son with tears on her eyes, wondering why Micky would betray her. For at least to her, that's what Micky is doing.<br/><br/>In the end, we can trust that the story ends well. After a very depressing, naturalistic first half, we arrive at a (subtle) transformation into hope. And I applaud this direction, because far to many movies take the route of either preaching how we can't get a happy ending, but the Fighter shows how fighting for one's future is always worth the punches."
"Fields201","9","2","3","18 January 2011"," MFields Review: The Fighter
","I was a little late seeing this one, but I really wanted to catch in the theater. Something told me that this is one that I should see at the theater and boy was I right. I enjoyed the heck out of this film, which begs the question, has there ever been a bad boxing movie? I'm sure there is, but most of the ones I've seen were decent to great.<br/><br/>The Fighter follows Marky Mark playing Mickey, and his crackhead, former boxer brother Dickey (played wonderfully by Christian Bale) in the poor side of town with a family investing in Marky Mickey to compete in these boxing matches. The mother especially (played wonderfully by Melissa Leo), as she acts like Marky Mickey's manager. Dickey, being that he was a former boxer and took down Sugar Ray Leonard, is Marky Mickey's trainer. The problem is that Dickey smokes too much crack, and is often late showing up for training. Not only that, but he's destructive, and often finds himself getting into trouble with the police, and because of this people don't take kindly to Dickey and are trying to sway Marky Mickey away from him.<br/><br/>Along the way, Marky Mickey meets a beautiful bartender named Charlene (Amy Adams, delivering a great performance and made herself into a very interesting character)and after a brawl with Marky Mickey's family, she supports Marky Mickey's choice into breaking away from that family, especially after a boxing match gone bad, and it really becomes a struggle. This becomes the center of the movie as Marky Mickey tries to cope with the struggles with his family, his relationship, and his determination to make it to the top.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie. It's well written, well acted, well told, well directed, and just an all around great movie. It's one of those movies where I sat enjoying it from beginning to the end. Some movies I just sit there and wonder if this movie is going to get better. I never got that. It was great right from the beginning. There were a lot of scenes where I felt like I was watching real people. I felt like I met these people before, especially the mother. I've seen mothers like that before. Then there's Christian Bale, who like Heath Ledger, I got lost into his performance and even forgot that this guy played Batman!<br/><br/>The only gripe about this movie is the ending. For some reason I just wasn't satisfied enough with the outcome. It felt like it came out of nowhere. I don't know if that happened in real life or not, but it felt a tad abrupt. Also I wanted to see more of the ending than just texts telling us about where they are now. I would be satisfied with one more epilogue scene just to see what happened after the big fight.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a movie not to be missed. I highly recommend seeing this movie. However, even though David O. Russell is responsible for this wonderful movie, it doesn't give him a free pass. He can still screw up his upcoming project, Uncharted. I just hope he doesn't."

He gets support from his girlfriend Charlene, who challenges him to be the best he can be. Mark Whalberg portrays Mickey and does so very well. It's his best performance. Amy Adams is very solid as Charlene, she's a great character and Adams is a very solid actress so it's a perfect fit.<br/><br/>This movie is an excellent boxing/sports movie, a terrific character drama, and deserves any and all awards it will probably win. But the secret weapon here is one man: Christian Bale as Dicky Edlund, Mickey's half brother who is now a washed up fighter. Bale has been a favorite actor of mine for years, and even after a slew of solid roles, he delivers his finest performance here. The arc is character undergoes is sensational. He takes an already perfect movie and elevates it to something truly special. He's already won the Critic's Choice and Golden Globe awards for it...give this man an Oscar already!

"CrbCrtx","Null","2","3","10 January 2011"," Shift In Focus
","A film that was designed to be the story of Mickey Ward suffers from a shift of focus from the main character to the co-main character and everyone else who is in a scene with Marky Mark. That is a polite way of saying that Bale completely overshadows Mark Walberg. This was Mark's best chance of his career to make a statement and he missed it. He portrays Ward as a passive, one-dimensional person but that's not the worst bit.<br/><br/>I didn't like DeNiro in Raging Bull but at least LaMotta was portrayed as a man's man. Walberg portrays Ward as a dare i say , a coward? Or the p word? Certainly not out of the question. His technique is good as is his naturalism , but his choices is what makes his performance weak. Both DeNiro and Walberg fell into the trap of watching On The Waterfront and their imitation or rather failure to mix the masculine and the feminine just doesn't make a performance. Where at the end of Raging Bull i am left with respect for Jake Lamotta , at the end of this i was like , so is Micky Ward like a cry baby coward?<br/><br/>With the main character not drawing us in , that task is unnaturally transfered to the co-stars who absolutely steal the show. Ward's mother, played brilliantly , dare i say phenomenally, by Melissa Leo and Dicky,played by Christian Bale completely steal the show. I have never been a fan of Bale but he has been steadily growing in his naturalness and choices, although to be fair this performance does not feature much theatrical control and is rather unrestrained. It fits the role of a crack head well, but the point stands. Dicky , unlike Mickey also has a character arc and Bale really shines later on when he gets clean. I think it's time to give Christian some sort of award because unlike The Machinist which was of poor technique , this is the first performance of his career that features a very solid, borderline on brilliant, technique. About time , considering how many movies he's made so far. Di Caprio finally has a rival.<br/><br/>Amy Adams who i first watched in Doubt and who made me tired of her eternally- intense-to-the-point-of-bursting-for-no-reason-eyes does it here again , carrying large amounts of energy for absolutely no reason. She feels out of place and the one flaw in the story is the lack of justification for her actions from the script , since the actress can't deliver that on her own. She reminded me a bit of Marisa Tomei in the Wrestler , that tough , almost ghetto chick who is , well , tough and not much else. Adams plays a hard bartender really well , really well, but the rest of her role sometimes doesn't make sense as her motivations remain totally unclear, apart from one line that mentions her failure at college. But one line is not enough.<br/><br/>The director David Russell whom i only knew as the director of Three Kings delivers a film that portrays a way of life instead of a story of a person and in that it is reminiscent of a Scorsese movie, but not in any way stealing or plagiarizing. The pacing and editing are simply textbook and all film makers of today need to see The Fighter as a lesson on how to pace a film and also how to construct a scene where there are many points of action happening. It's not crafted with symbolism as The Godfather and the cinematography isn't poetic , this is a gritty, reality based movie with , again , very close to perfect pace. The cherry on top of the very strong story is the hilarious use of humorous moments as comic relief that work really , really well.<br/><br/>The action scenes, or more accurately , the boxing scenes are incredible. Walberg behaves like a real boxer in the ring and that is very , very impressive from an actor , similar to Rourke behaving like a real wrestler in that movie. Whereas DeNiro's boxing scenes in Bull were stylized, these are anything but , they are straight from a boxing broadcast and look amazing. I shouted out in astonishment when Ward knocked out his opponent with a body shot after losing , as if i were really watching a boxing match. Half the audience started clapping at that moment.<br/><br/>All in all it is a sublime piece of cinematic work , but unfortunately a case of the supporting cast overshadowing the main character and all the negative effects that follow from that. It is really a flaw that the movie can't quite recover from , because it was deemed a character piece, but the slight lean toward the portrayal of a way of life , a la Scorsese , and the powerful , earth shattering supporting cast (every single one of them, from the trainer cop to the nightmarish sisters to the mother , to the father , EVERYONE) make a decent attempt to save it. Terry Malloy , nobody can touch you. <br/><br/>8.3/10"

"Eternality","9","2","3","8 January 2011"," In the realm of boxing pictures, The Fighter straddles in the territory between Rocky (1976) and Raging Bull (1980), with the latter being the holy grail of the subgenre.
","What happens when a volatile director meets a potentially volatile actor on set? You get one of the most intense performances of the year. Notoriously hard-to-work-with director David O. Russell (Three Kings, 1999) guides Christian Bale (who infamously threw vulgar tirades on the set of Terminator Salvation, 2009) to a great turn as Dicky Eklund, the drug addict brother of Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), whom this biopic is based on. The Fighter, as it is titled, chronicles Micky's rise to prominence in the sport of boxing, but it is not without its fair share of ups and downs as you would see in this quite masterful picture of drama and sport.<br/><br/>In the realm of boxing pictures, The Fighter straddles in the territory between Rocky (1976) and Raging Bull (1980), with the latter being the holy grail of the subgenre. It is raw, gritty, vulgar, and also a very revealing examination of the nature of human relations when people are under pressure to conform to the beliefs and expectations of others. The performances in this film are a knockout, and are perhaps the most compelling reason to head down to the theatres to catch the film. In addition to Wahlberg and Bale, the ensemble cast also features Amy Adams (Doubt, 2008), who is cast against type as a foul-mouth bargirl, and Melissa Leo (Frozen River, 2008), who plays one of the fiercest movie moms in recent memory.<br/><br/>Russell's rough, unpolished visual style gives the film a documentary feel, and this is aided by scenes which show a cameraman and some crew following Dicky, the footage of which would end up in a special social issue segment about ""Crack"" on HBO shown on television in the film. In the final quarter, when Micky gets a title shot, one would expect a thrilling boxing match, of which Russell delivers with aplomb. It does not have the gut-wrenching impact of Raging Bull, nor is it as inspiring as Rocky, but Russell's unique way of presenting the fight (he uses intentionally hard lighting, loud, overbearing commentators, and low-bass strings) makes it especially immersive.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest flaw of The Fighter (but it is not a major one) is that the character of Micky Ward is not screen-stealing enough and seems to play a secondary role to Dicky, who is a supporting character, albeit a very highly stimulating one. Thus, even though the drama is generally involving and exciting, it would seem at times that this film is not so much about Mickey but the strong-minded characters around him that shaped his attitudes toward his outlook in life. In a nutshell, Russell has done an impressive job with an excellent cast, and has shown that Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, 2008), who was originally slated to direct this, was not sorely missed.<br/><br/>GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
"nhrd_8","8","2","3","5 January 2011"," For a script that was ignored by both Aronofsky and Scorsese , David O.Russell has shown very well that he too can uplift an audience.
","The Fighter is a fat bundle of sentiments and emotions much like its last scene (the famous Shea Neary win,search youtube for real-life footage), not only for familial bond that ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) yearned for ,but also for the locational history and more importantly pride to be restored, here in this case Lowell, Massachusetts. The families there seem to have strong ties, whatever/whomever they might be.<br/><br/>Dicky Eklund's (Christian Bale, again turned down by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt ) welterwieght boxing career had died long before he and his over caring mother , Alice (Melissa Leo), realised it for themselves . His addiction to crack-cocaine was the center subject of the documentary named, High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell , that HBO filmed closely for 18 months. But he seemed to careen himself into a deeper addiction spiral and his mother , who managed Ward initially ,kept lying to herself. There is a scene where Bale sings an old Bee Gees song, "" I started a Joke "", to his mother, do watch out for the lyrics.<br/><br/>Bale and Wahlberg Charlene (Amy Adams) the sharp mouthed bar-girl is all about getting Ward into a focus that had him arguably ""back on track"". But Micky's win over Sanchez makes things more complicated, for his family in itself is complicated. A bunch of sisters who crowd the screen with their cigarettes and foul clichés topped by his mother herself, is just about enough for anybody.<br/><br/>But family is family and he knew he always wanted needed his half- brother Dicky's help. Somewhere someone always seem to be more important to us more than anyone anywhere. I guess thats what is called family. It is not because Bale is more on the screen that this film is overtly praised for his performance, among all critics all around. It is not because Wahlberg wasn't good, hell no (watch Boogie Nights). It is not because Amy Adams and Melissa Leo weren't great. In screen,they were equally good. Great , in fact. But,it is because of his (Bale) impact on screen even when he is not present.<br/><br/>The film is about Micky Ward. But Micky Ward is all about Lowell, his half-brother Dicky and his family and that is what we see. In fact when half the time the camera wanders on the streets occasionally floating in and out of houses filled with thick smoke and strong emotions it doesn't take too much time for you to realise, ""Here is a story that needs to be told"". Micky Ward might be a local boxing legend now ,but it was his crazy half-brother,crack head, Dick Eklund who was there to tell him ""This is yours"".<br/><br/>The final boxing match was a success both to the screen and in real with honest emotions which surprisingly and unsurprisingly didn't interest both Aronofsky and Scorsese . I guess the only thing that would've interested Darren must've been the drug quotient in the script and Scorsese , well he already made Raging Bull, so wth can't blame him. Just wondering, not that David O.Russell didn't fare well. It is his best till date, undoubtedly. But sadly for him ,it will be remembered for Bale's Oscar.<br/><br/>Oops did I jinx it for him? I hope not."

","I am not a film critic or even a film buff for I watch movies for a hobby. I am just a layman really when it comes to the critiques of films. But Christian Bales portrayal as a crack addicted brother of a boxer is simply outstanding.In my view there are good actors and there are great actors and there are believable actors. Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis are believable actors just for entertainment and that's OK. Robert Deniro,Harvey keitel and Al Pacino are good actors,actors with presence,intensity and craft. But really they only ever play one character in any film themselves but they act impeccably. Then there are the great actors who play character parts that you are totally absorbed into, such as with Marlon Brando Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, the Godfather. Dustin Hoffman, Midnight Cowboy, Tootsie and Rain man. Richard Burton, Marc Antony in Cleopatra, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and Becket.Then along comes Christian Bale, his batman was good his Terminator Salvation watchable, but his acting in this film is incredible. Will he win the best supporting actor Oscar or the best actor for I couldn't work it out for there was only one great actor in this film and it was him. If he doesn't win an Oscar for his consummate skill then there is no justice in this world or the other actors acting will be phenomenal and it will have to be that to surpass this effort.<br/><br/>I have to say the woman who is the mother plays the role brilliantly and so does mickeys girlfriend at times.The film encapsulates a working class area with it's depressing nuances and sometimes unnecessary brutality and vulgarity of life intricately. Mickey is the key to some excitement outside this insular existence and some hope in an otherwise mundane life that is going nowhere a story that pulls no punches(forgive the pun). Treat yourself in a world where there are so many incredibly bad films, this one is a gem one that comes along once in every ten years or so."
"ryangozlan","9","2","3","3 January 2011"," A Compelling True Story That Comes To Life On Screen
","After attending Alliance Films Canadian Premiere of David O. Russell's, The Fighter, I haven't been able to get the film out of my head. With great directing, outstanding performances, and a compelling story behind it, The Fighter was an excellent film. Already having tons of Oscar buzz going for it, The Fighter is a Holiday movie you do not want to miss. Sports Illustrated has labeled it as the best sports movie of all time (which is a great debate for any movie lovers) but regardless; this film has everything you need for an amazing sports media film.<br/><br/>The film is strong from start to finish thanks to brilliant acting, and unbelievable direction under David O. Russell. What performance to start with is difficult, but how about none other than the leading man (or so we thought) himself, Mark Whalberg. Plain and simple Whalberg delivers a strong performance as a character he usually plays, a gritty Boston native, only this time portrays the underdog Mickey Ward. He leads with confidence on screen, playing the sometimes frigid and sometimes confident Boston underdog. Whalberg's love interest in the film, Academy Award Nominee Amy Adams, delivered an incredible as Ward's tough yet loving girlfriend. Melissa Leo was outstanding as Ward's mother (Alice Ward) and really should have people taking notice of her incredible talent and performance on screen. She played her part to perfection, as the controlling mother/manager knowing what she thought was best for her son. Now for the man who stole the show from everyone, Christian Bale. At first the role of Dicky Eklund was offered to Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, when they both dropped out, Whalberg talked to O. Russell and made sure he put Bale in this film. The actor (who is considered to be the best actor out there without any nominations to his name) will blow you away with this incredible, and Oscar worthy performance. Bale has done what Ledger had done to him in Nolan's Dark Knight; steal the main characters film from right out of his hands. His mental and physical (which you will see in the film) preparation alone, is the definition of true method acting from an unbelievably talented actor. The actor pulled off what I think to be one of the best supporting roles in years and should definitely walk away with the award at this year's Golden Globes and Oscars. <br/><br/>The screenplay in this film, written by Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy, was nothing short of spectacular. I think the dialogue in this film really made the movie believable and allowed for it to come alive on screen in a big way. This film is the best sports film to hit screens in the past couple years and is worthy of the entire Oscar buzz that has surrounded it. With O Russell's directing complementing such a raw and powerful script, this film has everything you need in a feel good sports film. The fighting scenes were incredibly well done and captivate to the edge of your seat, having you cheer by the end of the movie. O. Russell really mastered and captured the audience with his new age Rocky film. <br/><br/>I will give it the A+ it deserves as the acting; screenplay and amazing directing allow this compelling true story to truly come alive on screen. The film is nothing short of superb and in my opinion the new age Rocky we have all been waiting for. For a movie that took almost four years to make, juggling between different directors and actors during it's initial stages, Whalberg and his pal David O. Russell have pulled out an incredible movie worth the hectic and long wait. If there is one movie you should see this holiday season, The Fighter is it."

","Sitting in his corner catching his breath after enduring a beating in the Championship fight, Mark Wahlberg's Mickey Ward is consoled by his estranged brother Dickie Eklund, played by Christian Bale. Bale bows his brow against Wahlberg's, and says, ""This is your time"" Director David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" is the inspiring true story of redemption. Christian Bale is powerful and nearly unrecognizable. He will win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He is awesome, and his visceral chemistry with Wahlberg distinguishes ""The Fighter"".<br/><br/>The screenplay and story by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, and Keith Dorrington recounts the true story of Welterweight boxer Mickey Ward during his rise to champion, prior to his legendary fights with Arturo Gaetti. Ward was one of the toughest fighters ever, with strong jaw, tremendous heart, and furious punches. Mark Wahlberg trained intensely, and looks amazing as a boxer. He captures Ward's rock steady toughness and angst as he contends with his smothering family. Bale is electrifying as his junkie trainer brother Dickie. In his prime Dickie Eklund stood toe-to-toe with Sugar Ray Leonard for 10 rounds, and knocking him down. Dickie is a crack head low-life, who along with their domineering Mom Alice (scary and controlling Melissa Leo) may be dragging Mickey down for the count.<br/><br/>Bale is amazing. I hated him in the beginning of the movie, as he fleshes out the irresponsible loser Dickie. Bale is scarily gaunt and high strung lanky nerves. However, Bale reveals Dickie's boxing intellect. During a prison visit, Dickie asks Mickey, ""What is your plan?"" for his next fight. Bale focuses and tells him exactly what to do. He reminds, ""I was talking about you."" Out of prison with his eyes hauntingly wide Dickie asks Mickey's girl friend Charlene (tough Amy Adams), ""So what have you done in your life?"" As self aware that he is such a jerk, he realizes that his brother is in love. In a scene of rare movie magic, Wahlberg says to his brother in reference to the Ray Leonard fight, ""You were my hero"" Bale with his back turned to the camera says, ""I was."" ""The Fighter"" is about stepping up and being a hero, even in spite of one self.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" works, because it is the story of redemption—for both Mickey and Dickie. Leo and Adams are absolutely strong as polarizing forces in Mickey's life. It is really Bale and Wahlberg's touching screen partnership that brings home ""The Fighter"". And this is balancing of styles and directing brilliance on Russell's part. Bale is raw powerful extremes. Wahlberg is unwavering and rock steady. ""The Fighter"" makes you cheer for both. Everyone deserves a second chance, and the chance to be great. ""The Fighter"" is very special and touching in that way."
"CassandraSparkles","9","2","3","25 December 2010"," The Fighter Is A Champ
","The Fighter is a movie that works on so many levels it's as dense as a black forest cake. Based on a true story set in Lowell, Massachusetts, about two boxing half brothers (their mother had a lot of love to give), Mickey Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg and Dicky Eklund, played by Christian Bale, it opens with Bale and Wahlberg sitting on a living room couch. Bale is a revelation; motor-mouthed, twitchy, punchy, and doesn't seem to have a lot upstairs. Believe that at your peril. Wahlberg sits quietly next to him. He's the kind of actor you can actually watch thinking.<br/><br/>Dicky's claim to fame is that he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard (who makes a brief cameo appearance). Now both he and Mickey are part of a road crew when they're not in a gym. Dicky trains Mickey for fights his mother the gorgon manager sets up for him, one of which puts him in the hospital.<br/><br/>The way The Fighter surprises and confounds your expectations keeps you on the edge of your seat, along with director David O. Russell's cutting back and forth between parallel scenes of Dicky on the prison phone with mother while Mickey battles a powerful Mexican opponent. It's like cage match dancing.<br/><br/>The fights are not just physical. The family and girlfriend fight for Mickey's allegiance. A new manager pits Dicky against his brother. Which ties will be stronger: the anguish of the family or the tempting opportunities? The low ebb between the brothers comes when Christian Bale, desperate to compete with an outside offer to pay for training for Mickey, pimps out his girlfriend and gets into a fight with the cops. Mickey hears the commotion and runs to intervene, only to have his right hand crushed by an overly zealous policeman.<br/><br/>An HBO movie-within-a-movie ties the characters and the action even more tightly. Bale (and the viewer) believe the documentary is about his knockout of Sugar Ray Leonard when it is actually about his downfall due to crack addiction. As Bale watches the documentary in the prison auditorium surrounded by fellow inmates, Russell cuts to Wahlberg desperately calling his ex-wife to ask her not to let their daughter watch it. She gleefully refuses, telling him she want her to know what kind of man he is. In another scene the bleary eyed mother shoos Bale's little son away so he can't watch it. When Christian Bale suddenly realizes that he is the subject as the crack addict as we hear the filmmaker within the film say Bale will end up in either the cemetery and prison. Cut to Bale's face behind bars.<br/><br/>The fights are taut and visceral. You can feel the body blows and get into the clinches. It all leads up to the climax which reveals the true nature of the brothers' ties<br/><br/>The cast, especially Bale who seems to do his own stunts jumping out of a second story window several times, are great. Amy Adams plays Wahlberg's love interest, a salty tongued college-educated bartender who is one of the very few characters who is not afraid of mother. She can give as good as she gets and doesn't take guff from anyone. She's also great-looking.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is terrific with intelligence, torment and restraint written all over his face. He's the rock who's shuffled aside by the mother's fantasies of Dicky's comeback and bears gamely under his ex-wife's abuse and his family's manipulations. I read that he trained for three years to get into shape for the movie and it shows.<br/><br/>Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson wrote the screenplay, which sounds authentically working class Lowell."
"gwaterross","10","2","3","23 December 2010"," Outstanding film, true to Micky Ward classics.
","I just saw The Fighter with my traditional Irish family, all of whom have a poor taste in their mouths left from past sports films that have fallen short of greatness. This movie is different. This movie IS great. I went into the theater expecting a mixture of the films Rocky and Ali, blended with a little bit of cheesy Mark Wahlberg dialogue. I expected to see a few fights, and I figured these fights would be unrealistic. I was very pleasantly surprised when I found myself clinging to the edge of my seat every time Marky Mark landed a blow on his opponent, or had blows dealt to him. Every hit was epic, and every cut was as juicy and gory as the real thing should be.<br/><br/>ON top of the fact that the fighting was supremely realistic, every fight that I witnessed throughout the film was also very historically accurate to the real Micky Ward bouts that have graced sports fans throughout history. Any fan of Micky Ward will be giddy with excitement when they see this movie because the director included commentary from the actual HBO-infused bouts. Commentators for the fights included Larry Merchant, Jim Lampley and Emanuel Steward, oh and let's not forget Michael Buffer. I was so pleased that I kept annoying my wife, saying things like ""this is so real, I remember this!"" ""Oh you wanna know what happens in this fight?"" And ""honey, this nest fight is awesome, just wait!"" Hopefully I didn't ruin her movie-going experience...<br/><br/>ON top of all this goodness, and lovely action, there is also the matter of acting... Mark Wahlberg, as many already know, is a bit limited in his acting abilities. Its not his fault, anyone who starts their media-driven career as a Caucasian rapper with more testosterone than Vanilla Ice is already doomed for a handicapped acting career. But to his credit, Mark Wahlberg was great, actually he was super. But.... the crowning achievement of The Fighter was the acting job of Christian Bale. He was jaw- dropping. Whether it be acting like a coked-out ex-boxer on the downslope of his life, or a loving brother who just wants his younger brother (Wahlberg) to look up to him, Christian Bale (Dicky Ecklund) was epic. He had me laughing, he had me biting my nails, and yes, he even had me getting a bit teary-eyed. Amy Adams did her part, she is edgy, and she has a nice caboose, and she also has a pretty good Irish accent. But if you miss everything in this movie EXCEPT Christian Bale's acting, it will not have been a wasted trip to the movie theater.<br/><br/>So, without spoiling anything more for soon-to-be Micky Ward fans, Mark Wahlberg fans, and Christian Bale fans, I will wrap this up. In the end, this movie is worth seeing in Theaters multiple times, and then seeing it again when it inevitably transfers to the $1.00 theaters,(we all do it, a dollar is a dollar). I have never ever reviewed a movie or TV show on IMDb and I came out of my shell for this film because it is just THAT GOOD. I haven't spoiled the movie, and I certainly haven't downplayed it. If you are a fan of terrific acting, terrific action, and Amy Adams booty, then why would you pass this movie up? Do yourself a favor this Holliday Season and take your brother, sister, mother, father, or significant other to see The Figher. Oh, and then go see Tron..."

","I had some pretty high expectations going into the theater to see this movie and once it was over I have to admit that I was disappointed in some things, but I was still overall very happy with the outcome.<br/><br/>The movie starts off about a boxer Mikey(Wahlberg) who is getting ready for a fight to stop his 3 fight losing streak and he is quite confident that he will win. He's so confident that he is telling everyone in his town that he is going to win. Meanwhile his some what famous brother(Bale), also Mickey's trainer, is addicted to crack which is affecting his training with his brother. Mickey's mother (Leo) is his manager who clearly loves her older son Dickey more than Mickey. Something happens at the fight that makes Mickey question whether or not he still wants to be a boxer. He meets Charlene (Adams) who gives him the confidence to try one more time, but this time it will be without the family being involved.<br/><br/>First things first this is not a full out boxing movie, it's more a movie about family. The story is quite interesting do to the fact on how dysfunctional the family is. Mickey is so blinded by love for his family he doesn't realize that there pretty much destroying his career. He finally gets support from his new girlfriend who helps him stand up for himself. The boxing in this movie is not very good, it feels very choreographed, but like I said the boxing is not the main part of the story.<br/><br/>Mark Whalbergs performance is good just nothing special. During the movie I even thought to myself that this is a performance I've seen him do before. Amy Adams is also very good, I just don't see what is so special about the performance. I don't believe she deserves any type of awards or even nominations. On the other hand Melissa Leo is AMAZING as the mother. You dislike her from the get go, literally 5 minutes into the movie. I've always said that if you hate someone enough that every time you see there face on screen you want to punch them that the actor is doing a great job and that is what Leo does with her character. Finally last but certainly not least Christian Bale's performance is incredible. It's the best performance I've seen all year. Going into the movie I heard a lot of great things about his performance, but you truly have to see it to believe it. He some how makes the character lovable even though he is a drug addict and a failure.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is very well acted with a great story about family and love. My only complaint is the boxing, but there truly isn't too many boxing scenes in the movie to take away from the movie."

","I just came back from the theater and had to write a review, first and foremost, GREAT MOVIE.<br/><br/>It's not just a boxing movie, the reason it was so good is because it focused on everything else. You see what goes on behind the fight, the drama of family and the build up to the actual event.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was tremendous, literally stole the show in every scene. He continues to impress as he moves from extremes like Batman and Public Enemies, to this. He has best supporting actor hands down in my opinion. Mark Wahlberg does a good job, it seemed like this role was made for him, it just fit his character and style well, but he didn't really steal the show. That being said he was very serviceable and played the part convincingly. Amy Adams, who plays Ward's girlfriend, sheds her romantic comedy side and plays a gritty, no-holds-barred tough chick, very nice to see. Melissa Leo, who plays Ward's mother, was scary good. She had me all kinds of angry at her throughout the film, just tons of emotions aimed at her simply from the depiction of her character, great acting job, can't ask for more.<br/><br/>The movie was very well done, had you on edge, just waiting to see what happened next. The fights were very well shot, had me clenching my hands together, it was that intense.<br/><br/>Go see this, you won't regret it."

","The fighter follows the early and tumultuous career of Mickey Ward. A Boston boxer who had is brother, Dicky Eklund, a former boxer as his trainer and his mother has his manager. Ward falls in love with a bartender named Carlene. Carlene shows Mickey how detrimental having his family has his trainer and manager is to his shots an moving in the boxing world.<br/><br/>The story is interesting but sounds kind of bland and generic upon first glance. However, David O. Russell finally has lived up to the promise he should with Three Kings. Once again he teams up with Mark Wahlberg, who plays Mickey Ward. Wahlberg gives the best performance of his career in this film. That being said he seems to be lost in the shuffle of the other great performances in this wonderful film. Christian Bale is a scene stealer as Ward's crack head brother/trainer Dicky Eklund. Bale is almost unrecognizable with his skeletal frame and thinned out hair. Bale is probably going to and should walk away with Best Supporting Actor in all the major awards. Mellisa Leo also is barely recognizable as Ward's mother/manager Alice. She give a very solid performance as the chain smoking mother who refuses to except tha her oldest Dicky is a crack head. Amy Adams is fantastic and lovely int her role as Ward's girlfriend.<br/><br/>The film from outside the ring feels like a mix of Cinderella Man and Million Dollar Baby. Inside the ring Russell films the same way HBO films their fights and in the ring he moves the camera as smoothly and in kamikaze style as Scorsese did in Raging Bull. The film is fantastic and the songs that played during montages are very nostalgic of the 1980s and 1990s.<br/><br/>The film will garner some awards. Most likely Best Supporting Actor for Bale and maybe Best Cinematography, however it may fall to True Grit or Inception. Adams and Leo will probably end up cancelling each other out in the Best Supporting Actress category.<br/><br/>This is easily the best sports or boxing film since Clint Eastwood's masterpiece Million Dollar Baby. This film definitely ranks up there with Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","""The Fighter"" is the perfect title for this film. Sure, we have Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) taking and dishing hits in the ring; however, the real fighting is outside the ring. It is all the obstacles that Micky must battle with his crack-addicted brother (Christian Bale), brainwashing mother (Melissa Leo), and girlfriend, Charlene (Amy Adams), that embody his title of 'fighter.' It's truly amazing what Micky has to go through, and the viewer can really feel the internal conflicts in his character pulling at each other and nearly ripping Micky at the seams. That is what makes this film so memorable. Russell does a remarkable job at showing human emotions, and the powerful performances of every actor in the film really sweep you off your feet. He forces so much empathy out of you that at points I found myself confused as to what he should do, though the choice should seem obvious. The fight scenes are definitely captivating, but it is the drama that leads up to his fights that is truly gripping. By the time you get to any of the fights, before a punch is thrown, You are already on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>A smaller aspect of this film that I enjoyed is how realistic the boxing matches are. A lot of boxing films, Cinderella Man and even Million Dollar Baby, exaggerate what it takes to win a boxing match. It does not take Goku's Kamehameha to knock somebody out. As an amateur boxer, I was often bothered by some of the hyperbolic blows seen in previous movies. ""The Fighter"" does a great job of continuing its visceral reality through the matches by showing how a seemingly withered punch to the body can actually be a match winning blow to an opponent.<br/><br/>In the end, this film is a definite must see. I actually enjoyed ""The Fighter"" more than ""True Grit"" which was surprising considering how big of a Coen Brothers fan I am. Bale's performance is worth the ticket price (only half an arm where I went). It's not quite a comeback story or an underdog story; it's somewhere in between that can only be found on the edge of your seat in the theater."

","Like many character dramas, ""The Fighter"" uses the feature that sets it apart--the boxing aspect--as a backdrop. It doesn't focus on it prominently at all, and instead chooses to look at its characters. Said characters, based on real people, are all solid and interesting, and it was likely a good decision to not focus on them instead of the actual boxing matches.<br/><br/>That isn't to say that the boxing itself isn't entertaining, it's just that the fights can't compete with the drama aspect of the film. The family drama, as well as the ones of specific characters and their relationships with one another, easily outclasses the boxing matches. Maybe it was the fact that I'm not a big boxing fan, and care more about good characters than watching two guys pummel each other for minutes on end.<br/><br/>There's another possibility as to why the fights didn't leave as big an impact on me as the rest of the film did. It might be because of the way they were shot. Director David O. Russell hired a guest director from HBO to film these scenes, and used the same type of cameras that were used in the time frame that the film takes place in. The fights are shot as if they were going to be shown on cable TV, and it looks far worse than the rest of the film does.<br/><br/>Even though this was the intended effect, it didn't work out as well as it should have. Sure, it gives the fights a more realistic feeling, but the novelty quickly wears off, leaving me wanting to see the fights more clearly. There is a lot of movement with the cameras during these scenes, making the fights somewhat difficult to follow. The times you do get to see them, the choreography is well done, even though it's exactly what you'd expect from a boxing match. Punches are thrown, people cover their faces, and more punches are thrown. Described as a ""chess match"" within the film, boxing fights to me aren't all that entertaining to begin with. Maybe I just don't get them.<br/><br/>The story that takes place around the boxing matches is more interesting, and makes ""The Fighter"" worth seeing. ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a struggling boxer, never quite making it. His brother Dick (Christian Bale) is his sparring partner, and his mother (Melissa Leo) is his manager. Things aren't working out well for him, and after losing an unfair fight, he considers quitting boxing for good.<br/><br/>He doesn't, of course, as he is egged on by his girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams). His issues with her, and with the rest of his family, take centre stage from this point forward. Dick is a crack addict, and is constantly late for training. His mother seems to favor Dick over Micky, and doesn't seem to have Micky's best interests in mind. Micky is a passenger in his own life, always having his decisions made for him.<br/><br/>The characters are all interesting, and they all attempt to make you care about them. You will. Their characterization is all strong, from Micky's passive demeanor, to Dick's back story, all of it is well done. You see the characters' flaws, and you want them to get past them. The film want you to feel hope, a feeling that you may or may not get to experience by its finale. <br/><br/>The story is the only real problem that the film has. Even without seeing many, if any, boxing movies, I figured out how each of the matches would end. Predictability is something that ""The Fighter"" has, and this factor does take away a slight bit from the story that the film tells.<br/><br/>The acting, on the other hand, definitely helps the story out. All of the main actors did a great job in their roles. Christian Bale especially stands out, playing the drug-addicted older brother to our lead character. He sells the role perfectly, and, as Bale is prone to do, he went through some physical transformations for the role. While he didn't lose the same amount of weight as he did for ""The Machinist"", (where he lost an astounding 63 pounds), he did lose quite a bit of weight. He looked like he could be addicted to drugs, and this makes you feel sorry for his character.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg also underwent significant weight changes for his role of Micky Ward. Unlike Bale, Wahlberg had to bulk up for the film, and actually began training four years prior to filming. He looks like he could be a boxer, and despite being nearly 40 years old, he looks like he could be the 31-year-old Micky. His performance wasn't quite as scene-stealing as Bale's was, but it was impressive nonetheless. Unlike previous roles, Wahlberg plays a quieter, more docile character in ""The Fighter"", something that works quite well. He usually plays more alpha- male style roles, but here he gives some genuine depth to his portrayal of the real-life Micky Ward.<br/><br/>To say nothing of the supporting cast would be a travesty. The secondary performances were likely better than the leads, but they do feel overshadowed at times. Melissa Leo and Amy Adams were both excellent, making you focus your attention on them whenever they appear on-screen.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" isn't so much about boxing as it is about the relationships between different members in a specific family. It uses boxing as a backdrop, a catalyst to bring forward the drama that the film deals with. The drama is intense, the fights are entertaining, and the characters are interesting. All of the performances were great with the supporting cast overshadowing, yet not totally negating Wahlberg's performance as the lead. Based on the true story of Micky Ward, ""The Fighter"" tells an intriguing story, one that will keep you interested from start to finish."

","This movie was the last movie on my 2011 Oscars highlights list to watch and it stars a stellar cast and tells the story of Micky Ward and how he tried to rise up to boxing glory just like his brother once did.<br/><br/>Firstly this movie is filled with fantastic performances. From Wahlberg's very underrated performance to Amy Adams' wonderful portrayal of Charlene and to Christian Bale's superb and crazy acting. To this day that is one of Christian Bale's best performances and I understood why he got the Oscar in 2011. This was a very crazy performance but as the movie shows the real Dicky person by the end, a very accurate portrayal of this interesting character. Wahlberg's performance is one of the most underrated things in this movie. He was calm and natural and realistic for the most part of the movie. Seeing him not getting nominated was weird and seeing Melissa Leo winning best actress was even weirder. The story is very true to the actual fact although some times it can be seen that it's been hollywoodized with periods where the hero is beaten up and then miraculously wins somehow. But that is done in a very fine way that made me close my eyes and say ""yeah... it's ok!"" compared to how the rest of the story unfolds. And really that would be my biggest gripe with the movie that sometimes the story gets somewhat hollywood typical and the boxing gets less real for more entertainment value, but that didn't took away too much from the quality of the movie. The story is very dramatic and very surprising and satisfying at times. There are lessons about redemption about rising up to big challenges and about trying to get everyone to support you the best they can while also emphasizing on how you should treasure everyone around you and take the best from everyone. This is a very motivational movie and a very realistic and well made movie with a great direction and superb cinematography that imitates the aura of television boxing very well. The music is just what you would need in this movie not being too sentimental and not too weird or unfitting for some sentimental moments, but gets the right balance between them. <br/><br/>In conclusion: Great movie with fantastic performances, great story, great directing and powerful messages. One of 2010's best movies along with The King's Speech, Black Swan and Inception. 9/10"
"MaccyXpert","9","1","1","27 November 2017"," Assuming that 'Wahlberg + Bale + Adams = good' is correct
","Seeing Mark Wahlberg (Micky), Christian Bale (Dicky) and Amy Adams (Charlene) all in this movie immediately caught my eye and they all delivered in this rousing - yet somewhat expected - sports drama based on a true story. <br/><br/>As I said, all the three above put in committed performances as very suburban and ordinary (and in her case, scrappy) people trying to honestly work their problems out. I would say Bale stands above them because he lost weight (already did that for The Machinist), delivered his lines authentically and created more of a mirror image of Dicky than the others did. Again, he's English, yet he nails the American character better than the others - amazing (no Batman rant yet) with a deserved win of Best Supporting Actor. Melissa Leo (whom I didn't mention plays Micky's mother) won Best Supporting Actress and I'm sort of torn between her and Adams - Leo had less screen time, but delivered a lot when she got it; whereas Adams had a bit more influence, still with solid acting (she got nominated, so it's something). <br/><br/>The style of the movie is very realistic; David O. Russell cuts out all the BS and sappy nature of what this type of movie could hold to go for something simple, yet able to yield a lot. He abstains from some sort of brutal and destructive drama by keeping some humour and good heart in there. The music is also very fitting and awesome, and I've picked up Back In The Saddle by Aerosmith from it. Obviously, being a true story, there is a degree of predictability, but Russell works with - and gets the most out of - the unique parts of the journey to make this film as entertaining as it is. <br/><br/>Also, I love the well-trained accents; they don't seem tryhard or overdone, especially for Wahlberg who is from Massachusetts, like Micky Ward. Even Bale (again, the Englishman) nails it. There isn't a lot to analyse or look into for this film, but it sure as hell impressed me."
"thegift-15298","9","1","1","17 October 2017"," This movie is the story of how Micky Ward sorts through his problems in life to get to the top of the boxing world.
","Nothing in life ever comes easy. The Fighter, directed by David O. Russell, is a drama flick based on a true story about a boxer that displays how getting something in life takes effort. The film revolves around the Ward family who is deeply invested in boxing. Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is the hard-nosed boxer in the family. He is managed by his insensitive mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) and trained by his formerly successful half-brother Dickey Eklund (Christian Bale). This family orientated boxing team is by no means perfect. Dickey is a crack addict and Alice is negligent of it. Micky, who has lost his past few fights, begins to realize the faulty predicament he is in. Thus, this movie is the story of how Micky Ward sorts through his problems in order to get to the top of the boxing world. The Fighter, a beautifully crafted film that is perhaps one of the most motivational movies out there, reveals the hindrances family can cause and the importance of hard work and perseverance in the road to success.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning the audience is immersed into the world in which Micky lives. Micky, drenched in sweat, is seen jogging around the old, rundown town sweeping the streets with a broom. Dickey is by his brothers' side motivating him to train. This opening scene is very well executed. The audience is able to see the town that Micky was brought up in. The camera follows Micky and Dickey as they make their run around town. Though not explicitly shown, the poverty of the town is revealed through the sub-par housing and the underprivileged people who live in these worn out buildings. The audience has an understanding of the rugged place that Micky comes from and this sets the tone for the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Micky's relationship with his family is quite rocky. Dickey, a crack addict, is supposed to be the role model for Micky. Yet, Dickey is caught a number of times at the crack house. If his dirty clothes and disgusting teeth were not enough to show that he is a crack addict, maybe the way he is constantly sweating and reliving his past by shadow boxing an imaginary Sugar Ray Leonard gives it away. Nonetheless, this is Micky's trainer. However, he rarely shows up and Micky is always trained by Mickey O'Keefe, the local police officer. Micky's mother Alice, who is also his manager, is negligent of the fact that Dickey is a druggy and therefore is blind to all the trouble that Micky receives from his family. In one scene, Alice and Dickey get Micky a fight against an unfair opponent just for the sake of getting payed. It is obvious that Micky is getting tied down by his family. <br/><br/>Despite all of this adversity, Micky works hard for his dream of becoming a world champion. This task is definitely not easy; especially when his own family fails to provide the support he needs. Micky takes it upon himself and steps away from his family. This is of course very hard for him. All his life he had known nothing but his mother and brother. However, this is a step in the right direction for Micky and his career. Nonetheless, when he is faced with a challenging fight, he consults Dickey for help. Micky trains harder than he ever did and is on a mission to become the champion he always dreamed to be. <br/><br/>Though one might say The Fighter is just like any other boxing movie which tells the story of an aspiring boxer, I would argue that this particular movie is better than the rest. This film illustrates the hardships that can be caused by family and how the strength and will to persevere and move on can lead to great things. The film is unique in the sense that it reveals the trials and tribulations Micky faces with great detail and leaves the audience with full understanding. One starts to feel for Micky and wishes they were in his corner cheering him on. After watching the film, I felt motivated to work harder at everything I did in life. I felt a fire burning inside of me that wouldn't go out until I achieved my dreams. This movie is a must watch and is a great source of inspiration."

","Yes it's been done so many times. Yes, Director David O. Russell is a great director, but this type of film is not in his wheelhouse. But it is now! Wow, what a pleasant surprise this film was. The screenplay and direction combined made this film look like it's the first boxing film I've ever seen. But the real hero in this film is the insane chemistry and performances of both Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, the latter just nailing his role. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo were also amazing in their roles. Then finally add to the mix that this is based on a true story - and executed perfectly, you end up with greatness in film- making. A truly enjoyable film and a must see! It's a 9/10 from me!"

","""Whatcha gonna do without your family?""<br/><br/>Every ambitious young man has felt the constraint. Maybe it is their hometown. Maybe it is their family. Maybe it is their friends.<br/><br/>Irish Micky Ward is no different. In this 2010 modern pull yourself up by your bootstraps, Mark Wahlberg shines as the overshadowed half brother of the Pride of Lowell. Just like in the retelling, most scenes are downright stolen by Dicky played by the incredible Christian Bale. <br/><br/>His complicated character appears first and last in the film. From the opening scenes of Dicky shamelessly showboating to his rocky path toward disregard, Director David O Russell's brilliant juxtaposition packs a blow. Just as quickly as Dicky seems put together, his goofy mannerisms are framed with heartbreaking vice and seemingly unkickable addiction.<br/><br/>It is not just Dicky, but the whole unit around Micky that closes in. Just went it settles in, the film changes on a dime. No longer about Dicky's elusive comeback (seems so simple in retrospect), Russell seamlessly tells the audience the real story underneath. <br/><br/>And like all good stories, a girl changes the calculation. After working up the guts to ask out the local bartender Charlene, it is the girl that clinches the interest. Nursing wounded pride, Charlene seeks out Micky after he apparently stands her up. It is not long before the inescapable hometown sings her less than desirable praises (she's into all girl manage a trois!) As soon as her views deviate from the family, the insults get sharper before the family brands her as unworthy. <br/><br/>Still, Micky wonders what he can possibly do without his family.<br/><br/>Russell in his steady direction could have settled into the story we know. The slow rise to the top with some minor speed bumps but nothing to derail him. That doesn't happen. Instead, even with the predictable path there are moments of surprise and uncertainty. More than anything though, the story continues to be about ""Welcome Home"" and what exactly that means. It could mean a drug house of dangerous temptations or it can be a career limiting place where demons need to be extinguished. <br/><br/>With careful aplomb the film reaches the third act. The heart usually resides here. With conflicting the woman who makes him strong and the family that keeps up his core, Russell again shows a well known story into a cohesive unit. Micky had to determine what makes him great while still transcending their inherent limitations. <br/><br/>Boxing films for the modern viewer can be very simple. Keep some of the standard fare and clichés that create timelessness. Tell the old story like its fresh. With dynamic performances, spectacular pacing and masterful storytelling, Russell accomplishes this brave new trail. <br/><br/>By its satisfying conclusion you realize there are few instances of the incredible. There's no over the top heroism here. Nor is there any pressure to suspend your belief It is simply a boxer, taking a risk and willingly leaving the comforts of the familiar. With that, you cannot lose. <br/><br/>The Fighter is a knockout (sorry I had to)."
"MilosGavrilovic","4","1","1","28 January 2016"," Below expectations
","The cliché story, almost every movie about boxing begins and ends the same, with the exact same plot.Directing and picture are slightly above average. Christian Bale is amazing. Too many pointless things just pisses me off. The role of Charlene is pointless. She just shows up and in three weeks she issue orders. I wonder what is her significance in the whole story? No, she simply doesn't exist. The film could have done without Charlene. And the fights are too funny. Oh, God, he receives blows throughout the match and then in the last round knockout opponents. What an exciting finish of match. Nobody expected this. We are all simply thrilled while crying at the end of the film. Come on, do not kidding."
"Harhaluulo54","4","1","1","18 July 2015"," Charlene said it, crazy duckin' family
","I have always had a mild problem with western sports series. The characters often suck so bad and the writing centers too much around one thing, making the titles not only character-centered, but seem like the whole world turns around the main character, and not the other way around.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a prime example of a sports title that does this exact thing. From the home town common folks to people in prison, every single one exists in the name of main characters, making the movie one-dimensional. This one-dimensional nature also spreads to the characters. As the summary implies, we have loads of stupid people in it. The family, and do it for the family philosophy, both are very annoying. The family itself contains drug addicts, self-centered arseholes and, in generally, hoes whose IQ matches their shoe size. This makes the movie seem like reddit where few people who have it going fight against idiots that come in masses.<br/><br/>Despite the terrible characters, The Fighter does good thing on delivering the idiocy and destroying it. The development almost makes this a feel-good movie as it is rewarding to see stupid people getting owned. The bad things unfortunately still out-weight the good, because there simply isn't enough time to make all the stupid people seem stupid enough. All in all it is not that bad of a movie, but definitely not good either."
"mikesample99","8","1","1","23 March 2014"," Good Movie with Great Acting, That Lacks the Emotional Punch
","The Fighter is supposed to be an equivalent to a real-life version of Rocky by telling a story of an underdog that is battling long odds and adversity for a shot at being a boxing champ. The story follows two brothers, one living on his past glory and the other trying to revive his boxing career. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is the younger brother of the very flamboyant Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) whose claim to fame is he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard, but now is a crack addict in and out of jail. Their mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) micromanages Mickey along the way in the hopes of getting her other son Dickey back into the spotlight. This worked until Charlene (Amy Adams) came along and stood up for Mickey's best interest. What transpired was a classic underdog tale mixed with a lot of family drama and some romance.<br/><br/>The Fighter's main theme is the true story, underdog tale of Mickey Ward who has many obstacles set before him on his way to win the championship belt. The interesting thing about this movie is the way it was shot. It was filmed like a docu-drama to give it an authentic and gritty feel. In the early 90s, HBO made a real documentary about Dicky Eklund, who thought it was about him reviving his career, but it was really a documentary about crack addiction. A big chunk of the first half of the film was basically reenactments of those scenes in that documentary. This technique extended to the boxing sequences as well, making them feel like the audience was viewing the actual bouts that were shown on HBO back then. The way the director utilized this technique really made the film feel authentic and it flowed very well. <br/><br/>Another technique the director used to bring the film theme to life is the soundtrack. There are two examples of the great use of the soundtrack. The first is the use of 'Good Times, Bad Times' by Led Zeppelin. This song was playing when things just started going good for Mickey, while his brother was in the process of getting arrested for posing as a police officer. There were shots mixed of Mickey with everything going good and shots of Dicky were everything was starting to unravel. This choice of song really added to this scene and brought out the serious nature of what was happening. The second song of choice was the power ballad 'Here I Go Again' by Whitesnake. Mickey and his brother were singing the ring-entry song as he was about to enter the ring in the final match. This was an excellent song choice for this scene that had many meanings and layers to it. It was a great use of song for Dicky because he is living his dream through his brother. He had his chance to win the title and lost. He has another chance through his brother of overcoming the odds and beating the giant that is in front of him. It was a great use for Mickey's character as well because while he may be accompanied to the ring by his brother, he can only win this belt on his own the same way he has had to overcome everything else throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The Fighter was supposed to be a true story version of Rocky. It's another boxing movie about an underdog over-coming trials and tribulations to become champ. The problem is unlike Rocky or Raging Bull; I didn't feel the connection to the main character Mickey Ward. I felt more invested in his brother Dicky and maybe that was because Mickey was so passive and didn't have much personality. I know it's supposed to be true to life, but I just didn't feel invested in Mickey's story. When he wins the title I didn't feel the triumph as much as I felt it was just a conclusion to the story. The acting was great and most elements of the film were fantastic, I just think the film didn't do a good job getting me invested into Mickey's character. In a boxing genre that is already crowded; this movie, while very good, did not stand out to me or even crack my top 5 boxing movies. I think the main story here was about the family and all the drama surrounding that which took away from the underdog story of Mickey Ward. It's a true story and I expected to get powerful emotional feelings, but this movie, despite the great acting, lacked the emotional punch I was expecting."

","I've never really been a fan of boxing, nor movies that have such a large focus around the sport. (I never enjoyed the Rocky films etc.) but this was actually a really enjoyable watch. Christian Bale must be one of the most underrated actors of our generation, I'm sure I owe most of the view- ability of this film to his submersible acting. Despite the irritating family of Wahlberg and Bale, something about this film feels very real. I couldn't help but be sucked into the emotion shared among the characters, whether I should have been or not. I'd recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Bale, for he doesn't disappoint with a role I've never seen him play before."
"hall895","7","1","1","9 May 2013"," Micky Ward's toughest opponent...his family.
","The Fighter, the true-life story of boxer Micky Ward, suffers somewhat from the fact that Micky Ward is pretty much the least interesting person in the movie. Micky is just a normal guy, trying to make his way in the world, hoping for that title shot. Unfortunately his family is far from normal, they're a bunch of lunatics. It is Micky's family, and his feisty girlfriend, who provide all of the film's personality. Micky is a rather bland character, left to do little more than react to all the chaos swirling around him. It's supposed to be Micky's film but, probably mirroring reality, Micky was never destined to be the star of his own life story.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg turns in a perfectly acceptable performance playing Micky but there's really nothing memorable about what Wahlberg does here. All the big showy moments go to other performers. Most notable is Christian Bale playing Micky's crackhead brother, and trainer, Dicky. An eccentric character to be sure and Bale holds nothing back in his portrayal. Bale might be a little too eccentric in his mimicry, so obviously performing that it becomes a little distracting. It's a performance which really calls attention to itself, maybe too much so. Look at me, I'm acting! Also wildly over-the-top is Melissa Leo playing Micky's chain-smoking, rather grating mother and manager. Amy Adams plays Micky's girlfriend Charlene, showing some great spunk as she stands up to Micky's looney tunes family in a way he never will. Micky also has a collection of seven sisters who are portrayed here in a way that seems to be meant to provide some comic relief. But they don't come across as funny, they are just pathetic.<br/><br/>With all the nonsense around him Micky really does end up getting lost in his own movie. His is an interesting story but the way it's presented here it's not even really about him. His family overwhelms him and overwhelms the movie. But the movie does still manage to be compelling. It may never quite grab you like some other boxing movies we've seen. The boxing scenes themselves are not notably better or worse than those we saw in so many other movies. There is the frustration that there is so much time spent with Dicky, who is a total train wreck, and the mother who is about as unsympathetic a character as you could possibly have. But the movie still packs a decent punch. It's not a great triumph if for no other reason than it struggles to make us invest in the central character. The other characters steal the show. Those characters are interesting in their own ways. Still it probably would have been better if The Fighter were actually about the fighter."
"piratecannon","8","1","1","27 December 2012"," One Round Too Many
","What would you say is the greatest boxing movie of all time? Rocky? Raging Bull? Or, as the most recent Academy Awards would indicate, the recently released hybrid blockbuster/art film The Fighter? I'll put my money on the former, but the latter is certainly a great addition to the genre.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, the little brother of former ""legend"" Dicky Ward (Christian Bale). Micky is trying to make his own name in the family sport, but it's all to obvious to everyone outside of his family (with the exception of his sane father) that his brother—a crack- addict who constantly reminisces about his single moment of stardom (when he ""knocked down"" Sugar Ray Leonard)—mother, and sisters are a detriment. Eventually, Micky finds a love interest in Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a local bartender who makes an effort to liberate said boxer from the quagmire of despair and misguided devotion that he's occupied for the past ten years. As you'd expect, a push/pull brawl ensues, and Micky finds himself torn between his loyalties to his family and those advocating for his ""independence.""<br/><br/>Much to my surprise, The Fighter—though certainly formulaic from time to time—actually takes some unexpected twists. At its heart, the success of the film falls on the shoulders of Christian Bale, who turns in a top-notch performance as a junkie who's battling his own demons. There's a refreshing sense of optimism to the narrative that does exactly what films like Aranofsky's Requiem for a Dream do not; that is, provide a tangible sense of hope. You know, the notion that it is, in fact, possible to overcome the doldrums of inner city drug use, low ambition, etc. In that respect, I have oodles of respect with what director David O. Russell and the accompanying screenwriters are able to do.<br/><br/>But then there's the tail-end of this sprawling monster (it's only 115 minutes, but, because of the final moments, it feels much longer). Instead of wrapping things up when the conflict that's effectively fueled the story has been resolved, The Fighter feels the need to push the story into the aforementioned Rocky territory by throwing in one last ""Battle Royal"" as the icing on the cake. This is disappointing, because although the movie is ""about"" boxing, it really isn't (if that makes sense). Including a title match that reflects the real-life events the film is centered on creates a ""tacked-on"" effect that just feelsfor lack of a better wordtrite. The impact of the resolution would have been decidedly heavyweight had The Fighter simply stuck to the good ole Freytag Pyramid and ended things when the true conflict is over and done with.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is a success, as it's able to stand on its own two legs as a worthy addition to a long line of excellent sports films.<br/><br/>Because of that, I heartily recommend it."
"Desertman84","10","1","1","20 September 2012"," A Fitting Tribute To A Real-Life Rocky
","The Fighter is a biographical sports film that stars Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. The film centers on the life of professional boxer Micky Ward and his older half-brother Dicky Eklund.It was directed by David O. Russell.<br/><br/>This inspirational docudrama explores the remarkable rise of Massachusetts-born, junior welterweight title winner ""Irish"" Micky Ward. A determined pugilist whose career in the ring was shepherded by his loyal half-brother, Dicky -- a hard-living boxer-turned-trainer whose own career in the ring was nearly sent down for the count due to drugs and crime -- perennial underdog Irish Micky rebounded from a disheartening series of defeats to win both the WBU Intercontinental Lightweight title and the WBU Light Welterweight title thanks to a fierce combination of determination and hard work.<br/><br/>This is a great movie about family and family.Led by a trio of captivating performances from Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Amy Adams, it is a solidly entertaining film that is probably one of the best released in the boxing drama genre for it is a fitting tribute to a real-life Rocky."
"perkypops","7","1","1","27 November 2011"," Multi-stranded drama, well performed but ultimately unconvincing
","The onion skin layers of human reality are brilliantly teased out in this drama, from the competing strong females in Micky's life, to the jealousy within families, how people are driven to fight for survival, and the simple actions that lead to success over the complexities that thwart. And because there is so much good acting on view (the female elements in Micky's life are all brilliantly portrayed) apart from Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale, and the excellent Melissa Leo, the drama is very compelling.<br/><br/>Although this is about a part of a boxer's career the boxing strands do not outweigh the drama outside the ring, which is good because the boxing is what, in my opinion, ultimately lets the film down. Let me explain a little further without spoiling the plot. There is considerable evidence within the film of Micky's good nature, his loyalty, and his strength of character but there is also a great deal of his weaknesses on show too. There is an attempt to transfer this personality to the boxing ring and it does not, for me, work.<br/><br/>It is still a very watchable and enjoyable piece of drama, but the intended ""feel good"" ending is out of keeping with the excellence that has gone before.<br/><br/>I award it seven out of ten for the superb acting but as a film it is not up there with the best."
"jzathajenious","7","1","1","4 September 2011"," A remarkably un-memorable boxing flick.
","This is a surprisingly safe film for a film maker like DOR to make, and as a result of its cliché conventions, it feels like it's trying to get Oscars, rather than trying to tell this story of this family skilfully. to put it simply, its a comeback film like 'the wrestler', yet told with little of that film's subtlety, or its pathos. you get the feel good story, with some obstacles to overcome along the way. THAT'S IT.<br/><br/>performances are mixed. Leo is very good as the overbearing matriarch (whether its Oscar worthy is another thing), and Bales is also very good as Dicky. wahlberg on the other hand, is stoic and impotent. he drifts through each scene without owning them. I've never been a huge fan of his acting, and this confirms my lack of admiration. its like he worked more on his six pack for the role than his acting. Adams as his girlfriend is also below her best, and i am a fan of her work. but here she plays a stereotypical boston girl, full of confidence and fire, but it feels like a caricature of nearly every other bawston female we've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>the script really plays it safe and there is never too many surprises in the plot's development. the family drifts apart, then dicky gets clean in jail, comes back to do right with his life, mom is forgiven, everyone is happy and friendly, and in an inspiring climax mick wins the world title, in a fight that is on par with rocky for its fight choreography. for gods sake there's even a training montage with an 80's rock number playing ala rocky. whether this is meant to be ironic or not i dunno.<br/><br/>Going from I Heart Huckabees, an abstract, existential comedy, which was obviously not meant to reach a wide audience, to a formulaic rags to riches boxing flick which plays like its counting its Oscar noms by the minute, is just mind boggling. 3 kings displayed the talent which russell so obviously has, but his last 2 flicks have quickly buried that promise."

","This movie is not about a dysfunctional family, it's a movie about a dysfunctional movie. During the film I got more and more disconnected from it. There were too large discrepancies in the acting performances to really make it swing for me. Wahlbergs lack of emotional range, which is zilch, contrasting with Bales range which is all over the place made the characters seem to live in different universes. With the two main characters acting against a very cartoonish backdrop in the shape of a supposed to be white trash family the movie fails to engage. I mean, what's the deal with the sisters? They look like they were dressed up for a hen party. No credibility at all. With such a baseline there are no saving graces for this movie. Discussing footage, storyline etc is irrelevant with these flaws in mind. Maybe there was a good story in there, maybe the footage was fine, we will never know. I"
"Robert_duder","Null","1","1","16 August 2011"," Critically acclaimed, worn out story with good performances
","I have nothing against Boxing films. In fact I adore boxing films. The Fighter was heralded nearly immediately for everything from the performances to the story to the film making and I do understand why and then at the same time I felt like aspects of it were way over-rated. This is not a new story by any means. This story has been done, some better and some worse and it really doesn't add anything to be unique. It takes gratuitous bad language to a whole new level which also doesn't bother me unless it gets way over-used and it does. It is still the Rocky story of the underdog fighting his way to the top and winning against odds only add in the drug abuser brother, the overbearing mother and the fact that this was 'based on a true story.' I'm not saying its a bad film, but I am saying that the two lead roles (more one than the other) save this film from being drivel and make it worth seeing just for those performances.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is a solid star in Hollywood now and I have seen him in some great films and I have seen him in so-so films. Sometimes he chooses right. This role is right for him. I don't think it required a ton of acting as he plays the athletic up and comer Micky Ward. Wahlberg gives an emotional and realistic portrayal and would be the best performance if not for that of his co-star. Just when I think I dislike Christian Bale and that he is becoming the ego maniacal, over-rated actor of people like Sean Penn he turns in a brilliant performance. Ironically it always seems to be when he loses a ton of weight and looks lethargic (The Mechanic is a must see indie-gem of his.) In this film he plays washed up boxer and heavy drug abuser Dick Eklund. He is breath taking in his role and if they were going to give Oscars for this film anyway his winning one is testament to how great he was. He steals this movie and turns a 4/10 into a 7/10 just on his own. On the flip side Melissa Leo in her constantly heralded role as Wahlberg and Bale's mother Alice should go down as one of the most over-rated performances in history. I didn't think she was impressive at all and I didn't think she even showed up in the film that much. Amy Adams gives a great performance (far better than Leo's Oscar winning role) as Wahlberg's love interest. She shows a flare for emotional dramatic performance in her character. Character actor Jack McGee is also solid in his role as well considering how small it is. He is always terrific.<br/><br/>This film is why myself, and other movie goers like me are becoming so disenchanted with Oscars and Awards like that. This film is okay, its good even and as I said there are some truly outstanding performances BUT the film itself is not that great. Reviewers and critics constantly complain about films being stereotypical, predictable and re-hashing old genre elements and The Fighter does that. But because its based on reality, features heavy hitters (no pun intended) whom Hollywood loves, and directed by David Russell who likes to play to indie critics they all showered it with praise. Watch it and enjoy it especially if you like boxing films and watch Bale's amazing performance and be ready to here and see more white trash than an episode of Trailer Park Boys and you'll probably enjoy it but its not the best film to ever come out of La-La Land by any means. 7/10"

","Fights themselves (boxing, mma, whatever) are hit and miss, to shamelessly indulge in the pun...a gamble, whether you're paying for ringside seats or tossing out a few bills for the pay-per-view. Some almost seem to be magically choreographed, resulting in spectacular action.....brutal, violent poetry-in-motion that is talked about for years afterwards. Others are spectacular duds, regardless of the supposed talent dancing in the ring...listless and impotent...forgotten or laughed at, depending on the level of failure (hungry Mikey? :) Movies are like that, we all know...boxing movies especially. Let's compare a couple big ones of late. Take Cinderella Man with Russel Crowe in '05 and then last year's The Fighter with Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Big talent in both, yes? Heavy-weights to be sure. Both these movies had all the pre-release ingredients of a title fight...yet only one of them was actually worth the price of admission, from my own minuscule perspective (both are equally and pervasively well-liked by IMDb's viewers, amazingly enough....both commanding 8.0/10 with over 60,000 votes apiece).<br/><br/>Cinderella Man seemed to moved with liquid grace throughout the film. Everything one might cherish about a Dicken's novel was clearly conveyed...with heartfelt characters struggling to survive in impossible circumstances...characters who make that rare transformation from ""everyman"" to ""hero"" in some ever-accelerating juxtaposition of destiny that offers its feeling of crescendo...of portent...to every step, every blow in the ring (the fight scenes themselves were exquisitely orchestrated, BTW) and every dramatic circumstance beyond the ring. Simply put, its a beautiful story...even in the context of the motif of two men beating the hell out of each other in front of crowds of people. I, too, was ""ringside"" and I felt truly involved...emotionally invested...in the fate of the characters in the story. And when everything was on the line toward the end, I felt the feeling of risk as well...nerves taught and pupils dilated...on edge...transported. Being magically transported...I've said, it before...that is the mark of a good movie. Cinderella Man transported me, effortlessly right through to the credits.<br/><br/>Now take The Fighter. All the grace evident in CM is nowhere to be found in this film. And I mean nowhere. Our boxing hero ""Irish"" Micky Ward is honorable only in comparison to his degenerate family, his mother and sisters (my god, how many?) a brood of greasy harpies who could only stoop lower by resorting to actual cannibalism. To see behavior like this outside the remote hills of Appalachia is downright scary, IMHO. His half-brother, Dicky, is equally degenerate without harboring the same predatorial spark his sisters engender. He's simply an addict using his crack induced euphoria to fuel delusions of grandeur about the good ole days of his long gone fighting career. Ultimately there's no sense of a hero's heart in Micky though, even in spite of his family. He chooses to indulge them throughout...even at the behest of his new-found ""Ariadne"" (Amy Adams' playing Micky's girlfriend, Charlene) sent in to attempt to lead our hero out of the dark maze of his ill-fated life. Not much help here, unfortunately...she simply doesn't have the drive or the intelligence to provide escape velocity for our dopey, earth-bound fighter. Simply put, this movie lacks heart. There's plenty of muscle and movement, but the overriding stupidity and squalor leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. The only saving grace, from a technical perspective, was the impressive, jaw-dropping transformation that Bale pulled off to become Dicky...as impressive as his unbelievable transformation in The Machinist and Charlize Theron's in Monster. He was every ounce the manic addict, sweaty and unflinchingly irresponsible at every opportunity. Nice job Bale. But that's about it for Fighter. No help from the fight scenes, themselves, either. They were poorly executed and unconvincing, offering no respite from my growing disappointment and smoldering repulsion.<br/><br/>This one is punch drunk, folks: only peripherally funny but moreover primally offensive to watch."

","By now if you have not heard about 'The Fighter' in some way I believe you were in some coma for the last 6 months and missed all the good movie news, award nights and web chatter. If so please note that 'The Fighter' is a movie which made huge success and very positive reviews and big time awards like Golden Globe and Oscar was also in its favor. And it was one of the movies which was based on true life events out of few which was making box office and topping up best movie award nominations for 2010. It seems like Hollywood is finding more unique stories out of the real life events year by year and fans like us say 'wow' and ponder about the real life people in them more and more. In my case I don't know how it is to be a boxer or how it is to be living in a small Us town in the 80's so may not make that much sense knowing it's a true story but there is some appeal in the whole art of movie making and touching the hearts of the audience. 'The Fighter' does is pretty damn well.<br/><br/>Based on true life events of two brothers Micky and Dicky who are bonded for good and bad and their path to fame in the boxing ring. 'The Fighter' has it wonderful moments. Micky played by Mark Wahlberg and Dicky played by Christian Bale who are similar in many ways with long term ambitions but totally different on the other hand who just cannot find a balance in their lives. Micky is an ambitious young boxer who struggles to make some wins and play big time. But he is under the shadow of his controlling mother and brother Dicky who was once a champion but wasted his life without cause for drugs. Micky faces criticism, trouble and humiliation for failure and he takes the blame for himself while Dicky gives himself up for his addiction. When Micky finally realizes that he need a break from his brother and his family and do something for himself, he makes the move with his newly found girlfriend Charlene. Finding a new trainer and a manager he sets up to train hard and bring some trophies while his family and girlfriend tries to tear him up both ways.<br/><br/>'The Fighter' has some several very strong performances. No doubt Mark Wahlberg was dedicated and had concentrated well on his character and even stunning is the performance of Bale. We know Bale for his crazy performances and insane dedication toward his role from the past. I was shocked the when I saw him in 'The Machinist' back in 2004. It seems like he did it all over again for portraying Dicky. Simply superb performance which ultimately gave him the best supporting actor at Oscars this year. Even the rest of the cast is well played. Mickys mother Alice and girlfriend Charlene is wonderfully played by Melissa Leo and Amy Adams respectively.<br/><br/>Well-made script and cinematography will quickly push you back in time with great detail and feeling. David O. Russell doesn't ring much bells as a director other than one of my all-time favorite 'Three Kings' (1999). However here he has made his strong mark in the silver screen.<br/><br/>But there are few reasons which I will note rate is as a must watch movie. The lead character at times looks like the supporting roll. Dicky takes more audience than Micky and the story go out of balance maybe. It's not a big issue as such but it should not be like that. And at times some scenes are just too chaotic and becomes a struggle between characters. If you had a boxing movie in mind this is not exactly what it will deliver. I would like it more if the real boxing had more weight comparatively to the troublesome life of Micky and Dicky. Well that's how I feel.<br/><br/>read more at flickshout.blogspot.com"

","""I'm the one who's fighting. Not you, not you, and not you.""<br/><br/>The Fighter is a family drama disguised as a boxing movie. A pretty decent family drama, in fact. <br/><br/>Maybe saying it's ""disguised"" as a boxing movie is inaccurate. Boxing is a big part of the movie and the life of the characters. But most of the drama comes outside the ring, as a result of the push and pull between Mickey Ward's domineering but loving manager/mother, his self-destructive brother/trainer/former champ, and his new girlfriend, father, and other people who are trying to help him achieve his dream of being a boxing champ. <br/><br/>Much has been made about the performances of Christian Bale and Melissa Leo, and the praise is completely deserved. Especially for Bale, who gives the performance of his career in this movie. Amy Adams was also great, and continues her string of strong performances in good movies (she's my favorite contemporary actress for good reason). That's not to discount Mark Wahlberg, who does a fine job as the central character. The other actors just steal the show. <br/><br/>All in all, I'd say that The Fighter is a solid movie elevated my some fantastic performances. Even if sports biopics aren't really your thing, you should give it a try just to see some excellent actors at work."

","Another boxing movie based upon a true story and superbly acted/directed, with commitment and fidelity to the real event. Where The Fighter is totally different from other films of the same genre (the great Raging Bull and the six Rockys) is the manner it involves the family, with Amy Adams perfect in her role, and Micky's mother and brother being very authentic. Mark Wahlberg is solid and deep, always believable, Christian Bale as well is superb, and together they make the story fantastically watchable. Overall it's more about a family relationship than the boxing but it's a struggle of life seen through a real fight."
"bobzmcishl","9","1","1","22 February 2011"," New favorite of 2010
","I was surprised at some of the less than sterling reviews of ""The Fighter"", especially Roger Ebert who only gave the movie 2.5 stars. I have now seen most of the nominated Oscar Best Picture candidates and my earlier favorite was ""The Kings Speech"" followed by ""The Social Network"". This movie tops both of them in my opinion. I attribute it to my likability factor. Did the movie entertain me from start to finish. All three of my favorite movies of the year did. That factor is the number one downfall of most movies; somewhere in the last half of most movies, they start to fall apart. The story line just doesn't hold together. I also give high marks to true stories told well, and my three favorites all meet that criteria. I also give high marks to dramatic films that are also funny. Kings Speech and The Fighter meet that criteria, whereas Social Network with its depressing story of the internet generation and legal fights over intellectual property right had very little humor in it. Lastly did the movie have an good all around acting and here is where The Fighter stood out. Mellisa Leo, Amy Adams, and Christian Bale were superb. Mark Walhberg held his own but stood out less because his character was somewhat introverted. When you grow up in a family of extroverts like Mickey Ward did it is easy to get drowned out in the conversation. The Fighter succeeds as a story of redemption and overcoming a dysfunctional family who don't always act in your best interest. the fight scenes in The Fighter are pretty realistic and I'm amazed at how they pull that off. Best of all there were so many funny moments in this movie. My son had to talk me into going to see this movie. It was the only one of the ten nominated movies he had not yet seen so I reluctantly went. I'm glad I did. My new favorite movie of 2010 is The Fighter."

I often find his films very hit and miss but I think this must stand out as the highlight of his acting career so far. <br/><br/>The star of the show for me though has to be Christian Bale, who once again shows what a powerful and diverse actor he can be. His portrayal as an crack addict living in the past, his one good fight everpresent in everything he does is first class. <br/><br/>I really can't recommend this film enough, even if you are not a boxing fan.

","OK, lets get one thing straight first... Raging Bull is the best boxing film ever made and making comparisons with that film is pointless, but comparisons should be made. Both films are based on true stories, both are boxing films that look into the dark side of the characters, and both include amazing performances.<br/><br/>The Fighter contains some of the best acting performances of the year. Christian Bale is easily one of the best movie actors of our time (as Robert De Nero was once upon a time), and this performance again displays his adaptability into any role and again raises him up to the echelons of Nero and Day Lewis in modern cinema (if you only know him for Batman you need to rent The Machinist or Rescue Dawn asap).<br/><br/>The film drew me in and engrossed me totally, mixing scenes of action, family dis-functionality, brotherly love, romance - you name it and its in there. Wahlberg always seems a bit wooden to me (hence the lost star). Even when playing emotional scenes I always lack belief in his characters. This may be a personal opinion and doesn't detract from a great film. <br/><br/>Final word - you have to see this film. Ladies, it is much more than just a boxing movie."

","THE FIGHTER is another boxing movie that packs a heavy punch, and it easily resembles two of the most famous and beloved boxing movies of all time, ROCKY (1976) and RAGING BULL (1980), which is interestingly two very different pictures; THE FIGHTER combines that ultra realistic, intimate, wore down inner-torments with that charismatic, uplifting one- in-a-million shot chance of your lifetime with the big heart beating louder than ever, and it manages it. It's a difficult task to pull off, but director David O. Russell and the screenwriters keeps a great pace and we're given good time to root for the characters and the scenes, which holds much emotionality firstly by actors working their guts out. Mark Wahlberg plays the main character, Micky Ward, so straight-forward and stale that he actually becomes a stable holding point in a film where everybody else around him is all over the place, especially his mother Alice played by Melissa Leo and his crack-head, ex-boxer, personal trainer half-brother Dicky played by Christian Bale, both very memorable performances. I loved the fact that the film has this bruised and bleeding heart pumping all the way through, but in the same time it's got good humor and everyday sensibility, and it's way of using music (Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Whitesnake, Aerosmith and more) is almost ironically powerful. Take this film to the ring, you won't regret it."

","Finally getting of the ground after waiting years for financing David O Russell brings the story of boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward to the big screen. Famously Micky's brother Dicky, also a boxer and trainer, went 10 rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down to put their home town of Lowell on the map. A true story we join Dicky, a sure Oscar performance from Bale, as he is interviewed by a camera crew for a supposed documentary on his comeback, although as the film progresses we learn that all is not as it seems. Despite being a film about boxing most of the action takes place outside the ring as that's where the true conflict is in this film, when you meet the brother's mother, another stunning turn from Melissa Leo, and the collective harpies that are her vicious metal haired daughters you'll soon see why one turned to drugs and they both started punching things. It's in these tragically real characters that the essence of the film lays, the hope, the despair, the humour and hopefully the redemption as the story progresses to the abrupt, and slightly rushed, ending. Although a story that's been told time and time again Russell has managed to bring something relatively new to the genre. The only down side is that Bale's performance spends most of the film threatening to out shadow everything else, with his gaunt face, wide eyed stare and flailing muppet arms he is at times unrecognisable, in fact as the credits roll we get to see some footage of the real Dicky and its quite eerie. Walhberg, who apparently wanted this so much he stayed in shape for four years while waiting for it to get made, is the weak link in the cast, he may look the part but his acting is nothing short of wooden. But with surprising direction from Russell who, has come along way since 'I Heart Huckabees', and seems to be following in the footsteps of the great Michael Mann giving the film a real dirt under your finger nail feels. The title has various meanings with almost everyone in the film fighting something whether its opponents, drugs, family, inner demons or simply the grind of everyday life and though the film has an uplifting outcome it is at times a hard but powerful watch."

"mrtomclift","7","1","1","26 January 2011"," A cliché but never the less effective boxing drama
","Prior to last week, the only film of David O. Russell's that I had seen was Three Kings, an energetically shot heist film set during the closing days of the gulf war. That movie – one of my all time favourites – is a unique blend of black comedy, drama and political satire, as well as an action movie that consistently subverts the stereotypes that pervade so many of its Hollywood compatriots. Based on my love for that film, the idea of Russell directing a boxing drama in The Fighter was extremely enticing – after all, what genre is more primed for a sly deconstruction than the one that houses six Rocky movies? Unfortunately, Russell's latest effort more or less toes its generic line, with hardly any of the rebellious spark that made Three Kings so exciting. That's not to say The Fighter isn't good; it is. At times, it is truly triumphant, combining rousing fight scenes with effective family drama, and containing one of the most flabbergasting performances of the season. Yet in spite of all this, as I exited the theatre, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Perhaps my dissatisfaction lies in the films very premise, one that feels strikingly familiar to the many boxing films that came before it, and one that is made no less trite by the fact that it is based on a true story. A muscle-bound Mark Wahlberg plays Mickey ""Irish"" Ward, a welterweight boxer from the blue collar neighbourhood of Lowell, Massachusetts. Despite his talent, Mickey seems destined to remain a stepping stone; a man for other fighters to defeat on their way to bigger and better things. His lack of success is due in no small part to the machinations of his horrid family, which includes a parasitic mother who is also his agent, a drug addicted half-brother who is also his trainer, and an enormous number of freeloading sisters who all rely on the money Mickey's fights bring in. On the verge of quitting, Mickey is offered one last shot at stardom, but only on the condition that his family remains uninvolved.<br/><br/>As I said, The Fighter is good, and all of the above makes for some often compelling cinematic drama. Ultimately however, the blending of dysfunctional families and underdog fighters is nothing that hasn't been handled better in films like Raging Bull or The Wrestler, both of which also feature lead characters far more interesting than Mickey Ward. Neither does David O. Russell offer enough directorial flair – barring one or two individual moments – to make the movie-making distinct. Too often, the director falls back on the old standard of the training montage, in this case inexplicably set to popular nineties rock music. None of this is enough to cripple the film, but I have a hard time imagining wanting to revisit The Fighter when it offers very little that I haven't seen done better before. One thing I will give it credit for are the boxing scenes; magnificently staged, Russell and Wahlberg really highlight the brutality and primal excitement of the sport.<br/><br/>If the movie is at all transcendent, it is in the realm of its performances. Mark Wahlberg is a notoriously hit and miss actor, but his work in The Fighter is definitely amongst his best. Melissa Leo is expectedly terrific as Mickey's intensely dislikable mother, and it's great to see the so often typecast Amy Adams playing outside her usual element as Mickey's love interest, a working-class woman with a few battle scars of her own. But not one of these performers can hold a candle to Christian Bale as the squirrelly, drug-addled Dick Eklund. The Fighter marks the third time (after The Machinist and Rescue Dawn ) that Bale has shed massive amounts of weight for a part, a feat that reflects his absolute dedication to this role. Sporting a Boston accent that renders him almost unintelligible, Bale's work is the reason to see this film, and one can't help but suspect that the reason O. Russell inserted footage of the real life Dick Eklund into the films end credits was so audience members could see how spot-on Bale really is.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a good movie, and one that is definitely worth seeing. My disappointment comes mostly from unreal expectations, born both of my love for Three Kings and of the enormous hype that has surrounded this film; a hype that, despite me liking the movie, feels largely overblown. It is also perhaps a disappointment born of having seen one too many boxing movies, many of which I ultimately prefer over this one. But I'll be the first to acknowledge that just because a movie isn't original doesn't mean it can't be good. And at the end of the day, be it the drama, the boxing or the mind-blowing performance from Bale, there is very little about The Fighter that doesn't work."
"jonnyfendi","7","1","1","23 January 2011"," Bale's Knock Out Performance
","I saw Christian Bale for the first time when he was in Steven Spielberg's war epic ""Empire of the Sun"" (1987). He was an innocent child with red ruddy face. And now, he is on a transition to become a great character Actor, always bumps into great movies with great scripts (I observe that the other one has to be Leo DiCaprio). Have you ever heard about Micky Ward? He was former WBU World Champion in 1980s period. Thiz is a real-life story about early years of his career. Talking about Ward will not be completed without talking about the man behind him, his personal trainer and half blood brother, former Welterweight Champion Dicky Eklund. Eklund's most notable fight was when he against Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978. I find that boxing movies always made a deep impression about human struggle. It is perfect metaphor for any of us. You could feel the deepness and intensity like in Robert DeNiro's ""Raging Bull"" (1980), Denzel Washington's ""The Hurricane"" (1999), Russel Crowe's ""Cinderella Man"" (2005) and even American hero icon ""Rocky"" (1976-2006). Micky Ward is played by Mark Wahlberg. At a glance, Wahlberg is a perfect choice for boxer figure, but once again Mark Wahlberg is still Mark Wahlberg, although his acting is not bad at all, we can still see the typical Mark Walhberg. In fact, the most interesting part that attracts us in thiz film is definitely Christian Bale's transformation as Dicky Eklund. If you know Eklund in person, then you know how Eklund's attitude looks like, how he talks, the body language and his indifferent demeanor. Bale made a phenomenal impression to portray that figure completely. A good acting is not only coming from the appearance, but how you can create a precise ""Soul"" to fill into the character. And Bale made it! After all these years, he reminds me of how much he has been dealing with each of his roles so seriously. For me, he is the next Daniel Day-Lewis. The next thing that catches my attention is Amy Adams. Have you ever seen her acting in ""Enchanted"" (2007)? Adams made a sturdy and sexy performance all at once as Ward's girlfriend. I keep asking myself, where has that princess Giselle's character gone? The best bold performance actually comes from Melissa Leo for the mother figure. There is a scene in a living room, when Leo talks furiously to her family. In that moment, I really feel she actually talks to me. The amazing gesture to portray a real situation surprisingly comes from that small role. Again, the movie uses a lot of hand-shake camera techniques to drag you into the middle of the situation. Notably, I love how every time they pull us into ""Boxing Ring Scene"". Suddenly, it looks like we have been watching those 1980s TV boxing matches, the picture contrast and camera angles have suddenly changed dramatically. The movie direction comes from not too very active Director, David O. Russel. He usually only made one film for every two or three years. Some of his previous directing credits are ""I Heart Huckabees"" (2004) and my favorite ""Three Kings"" (1999). Substantively, you could see that Eklund uses Ward to redeem his past mistakes. Eklund needs Ward. Even more, His entire family needs Ward. I really understand, Ward becomes their asset, hope and dream. But the truth is Ward also needs them. The movie reminds us of everybody needs everybody. You don't need time-machine to change your past. But you can actually change it now in a present time.<br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","While many are calling this film a ""winner"" and positioning it for best picture of 2010, I just do not see that. Yes, it is quite good and even better than I expected for a film that is basically the same old underdog rises up story.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg (who looks like Matt Damon) is a decent actor, but it is Christian Bale that steals the show here. Fragile, a little bit crazy, he is not even recognizable as the man who plays Batman. Few if any actors today put as much effort into becoming their roles than Bale does, and he is the reason to watch this film -- without him it would just be average.<br/><br/>Expect this to get Bale a nomination and probably a win for supporting actor... beyond that, I do not see it."
"thekyles99","7","1","1","7 January 2011"," Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Melissa Leo all deserve awards for their performances in this
","Christian Bale should be at least nominated for his performance in this. I simply love boxing movies most likely due to the fact that any sorta fighting sport is definitely my cup of tea. Having seen both raw footage of the actual Micky Ward on you tube and the documentary HBO put out on crack addicts that starred his brother and occasional trainer Dicky Ecklund ( Christian Bale). for those of you who have seen this film and are wondering if his life and family were that rough around the edges would definitely suggest you see the documentary. Mark Wahlberg who portrays our star Micky Ward pretty much plays himself in this character with nothing special to add. Really impressive was not only Bale's performance but Amy Adams as well if you want to see how versatile she is, see this film and then go home and watch her performance in Disney's Enchanted she definitely is one I'm going to keep my eye on as she keeps upping her game. The movie is very good and written not far from the truth."
"clsilver","7","1","1","6 January 2011"," Good Movie,
","For acting, this movie is perfect, absolutely perfect. But as for content, I was disappointed. I was hoping to see more of Micky's life as a city worker for Lowell and his time in the ring, instead, the movie focused heavily on Charlene and the airing of ""High on Crack Street"". While these affected Micky in real life, they had no bearing on his career in the ring. And I was really hoping to see a close re-enactment of round 9 of Gatti/Ward I.<br/><br/>I have to say, Bale did an outstanding job of portraying Dickie, he will surely be winning awards for this part. He talks and acts just like Dickie. Compare Bale to the real Dickie in ""High on Crack Street"", you can find it in it's entirety on YouTube.<br/><br/>I realize not every minute detail can be crammed into a film, but I think the producers made a big mistake by leaving out Gatti/Ward I, it is the reason why Micky Ward is well-known in the boxing world. The Gatti bout was a opportunity that Micky got through a stroke of luck and it was the first time in his career he made good money as a fighter. Micky accepted the bout, fought--the ninth round would be called the ""round of the century""--and won by decision. Think Rudy. It's a real-life, rags-to-riches success story... and they omitted the climax!<br/><br/>I recommend people look up that fight and ""High on Crack Street"", both are on YouTube."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","1","1","3 January 2011"," Predictable, occasionally slow, and a bit ill structured from a screen writing perspective, but it benefits from an outstanding ensemble cast.
","Recently I saw The Fighter, a film that stars Mark Wahlberg as Mickey Ward, a boxer who's been suffering from a string of severe losses due to the influence of his family. He's coached by his unreliable, crack addicted half brother, Dicky Eklund (Played by Christian Bale), and managed by his control obsessed mother, Alice (Played by Melissa Leo). This isn't even mentioning Mickey's many sisters who just won't shut up. But his new girlfriend Charlene (Played by Amy Adams) spells out how his family has been more of a hindrance than a help, and that he needs to find balance between his own life, and his family's.<br/><br/>I liked this movie, but I didn't like it as much as I wanted to. One of the main problems is the screenplay, which seems a bit ill structured at times, and doesn't give the character of Mickey Ward as much attention as he needs, sometimes focusing more on his family. His family are a fascinating bunch of characters, but because of his lack of focus, I just couldn't get anymore than tepid for Mickey's story arc. The film also feels slow at points.<br/><br/>But it's certainly not bad by any means. Director David O'Russel earns some strong performances out of his cast, such as Mark Wahlberg trying to do his best with the title character, Amy Adams surprisingly doing better than I had expected, as well as standouts Melissa Leo, and especially Christian Bale, who gives an impeccable, and utterly enthralling portrayal of addiction, and failed ambition. I also found the boxing sequences, shot in the style of HBO broadcasts, to be enjoyable, and the final fight is a triumphant scene.<br/><br/>I give The Fighter *** out of ****"

But to my delight it was much, much more. the movie tackled many subjects, drug addiction in America. family issues. loyalty, relationships, basically it took the old rocky formula and added to it. the standard of acting here was outstanding, Christian bale in particular proves once again that he is much more than a bankable action star and should win the Oscar for best supporting actor or at least get his first Oscar nod.Amy Adams and Melissa Leo also gave very strong performances. Mark Wahlberg was also good. but at times it was very much a case of Mark Wahlberg playing Mark Wahlberg. but he was strong in parts.

This movie will have multiple nominations when Oscar time rolls around. The city of Lowell paints a good background for this picture. Not since Raging Bull have I been so into a boxing movie. Bale is always top notch and Walburg keeps showing his acting teeth. With the action not to over done and the meat & potatoes of training for the Big fight you will want to cheer for the underdog. This is the one for you. Great for the whole family. Will see this movie multiple times."
"rooee","5","4","9","25 February 2011"," Between Rocky and a hard place
","The quote on one poster for David ""Three Kings"" O Russell's spirited, hackneyed boxing biopic proclaims it to be the best since Rocky. I guess it's best not to remind folks of Martin Scorsese's magisterial masterpiece, lest audiences stay home and turn on the DVD player instead.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, the rough, rising star from the malnourished streets of Massachusetts. Christian Bale plays his half-brother and trainer, Dicky, a falling star who once tripped up Sugar Ray Leonard in the ring. They're surrounded by women: Micky's monstrous mother-cum-manager, Alice (Melissa Leo), a thousand ugly sisters, and no-nonsense girl-next-door Charlene (Amy Adams). Arguments ensue - fickle feuds and anguished hugs - and we even get some boxing toward the end.<br/><br/>It comes across as the wonky-nosed, crackhead triplet of The King's Speech and 127 Hours, insofar as it is an almost feverishly inspiring, consoling film born out of hard times. Except the performances here are relatively one-dimensional. And the script, credited to four writers, comes disconcertingly to life as a bizarre Frankenstein creation - sometimes a family farce, sometimes a sports drama cliché checklist, sometimes a maudlin forgive-a-thon under afternoon porches - and excels at nothing.<br/><br/>As for the boxing scenes... Flat. Cursory. Russell just doesn't seem altogether interested. Which, in the final moment, is no surprise. A formula fighting film will always end with a ruckus - yet by that point all the conflict within the family has been defused. The writers attempt to surgically implant some drama into the climactic battle by having Dicky give one last stirring speech. But it's hard to soar on the zephyr of an afterthought.<br/><br/>There are some good individual scenes in The Fighter, especially early on. The introduction to the half-brothers has them bouncing through Lowell, inhabiting their time and place, while the camera spins and glides. The aforementioned sisters provide some amusement as a chorus of permanent disdain. In fact, while the film sustains its first-third burlesque tone, it's fun. And there is definite pleasure in watching Bale return to the feral grandstanding with which he made his name prior to the constraints of Bruce Wayne.<br/><br/>The Fighter ticks a lot of boxes - too many. The result isn't a disaster, but nor is it Best Picture."
"bkoganbing","10","4","9","24 December 2010"," His Strength And Weakness
","I'm figuring that The Fighter is going to win one flock of awards just looking at the nominations already received by this film by several film ratings organizations. The Fighter should be good to go for the Oscars, especially for Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo.<br/><br/>This is the true story of Micky Ward who lived a real life Rocky story albeit in a lighter weight class. Ward like the screen Rocky Balboa was headed for the career of a steppingstone type pug who turned things around in a very big way. He also redeemed the family name somewhat because he had an older brother who had a title shot, but lost it and then turned to a life of petty crime. <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg who never seems to lose his New England speech pattern no matter what role he's cast in is brilliant as Micky Ward. I'm betting that it's a matter of pride to him because he certainly could afford the speech lessons. Wahlberg's biggest problem in the film is his family they are his strength and weakness. That's something he could draw from in his own family if you know something of his background.<br/><br/>Opposite Wahlberg is Christian Bale who has played all kinds of roles with differing accents in his career. He's as skilled as Robert Mitchum was at accents. He's got the Boston accent down perfectly as the older brother who's doing time in the can for some petty criminality and his scene at showing the pangs of crack withdrawal are reminiscent of Frank Sinatra in The Man With A Golden Arm.<br/><br/>But I think who really owns this film in whatever scene she's in is Melissa Leo, mother of nine children, who doubled first as manager for Bale in his career and now is steering Wahlberg's career. If she's not nominated for an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category she will have been robbed. Seems like I've heard that in a boxing story before.<br/><br/>The Fighter was shot in Lowell, Massachusetts where Ward and his family are from and director David Russell is as good with the camera as with his players. He and his film merit considerable Oscar consideration.<br/><br/>Do not miss a film that is destined to become one of the great boxing movies ever."
"Floated2","9","3","6","11 January 2011"," Inspirational and emotional boxing story
","""The Fighter"" works, because it is the story of redemption—for both Mickey and Dickie. The film isn't really much about boxing, yet about Mickey's family problems and personal issues.<br/><br/>It is really Bale and Wahlberg's touching screen partnership that brings home The Fighter. And this is balancing of styles and directing brilliance on Russell's part. Bale is raw powerful extremes. Wahlberg is unwavering and rock steady. The Fighter makes you cheer for both. Everyone deserves a second chance, and the chance to be great. <br/><br/>The Fighter is less about boxing than this familial conflict, which offers two equally absorbing stories in its first hour. There's Dicky's delusional, drug-induced dream of becoming the ""Pride of Lowell"" again and not as a sarcastic punchline, and then there's the dual nature of Mickey, who's a noted brawler in the ring but can't stand up for his own career or say anything slightly critical of anyone in his family for fear of letting them down.<br/><br/>Dicky has a documentary film crew following him everywhere, as folks come out of shops on the main street of their declining neighbourhood in the Massachusetts city to wish him well, cheer him on, and, probably most importantly, get on camera. Dicky once held his own with Sugar Ray Leonard (who appears in a cameo as a fight commentator). His claim to fame is that during that fight, Dicky knocked Leonard down, although there are the realists who point out that the champ tripped. Director David O. Russell throws in the footage for us to judge. From his fighting style and a coda at the end featuring the real brothers, one can garner Dicky's brash personality, which Bale captures in a transformative performance, heavy on fast-talking lies or covers but broken by addiction. Overall, the Fighter is a very great film and I'd recommend it to"
"DICK STEEL","10","3","6","8 January 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Fighter
","The documentary Facing Ali by Pete McCormack had presented a timeline into the career of Muhammad Ali, one of the greatest boxers of all time, and the compelling stories of the fighters who had once traded blows with him. I suppose these larger than life personalities, spending their professional career under intense training for a gladiatorial sport, comes with a whole host of human stories behind their personas, and perhaps that's why there's always a slew of boxing films to come out from time to time.<br/><br/>Not another boxing film again you may add, since you probably have seen the Rocky films and Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby, to biopics like Raging Bull and Cinderella Man, almost always telling of how the protagonist have to overcome challenges both inside and outside the ring. But I suppose human interest stories, those inspirational ones, will never be out of fashion, because they all serve as reminders of how we can achieve our goals and dreams if we put our minds, focus and efforts to doing that, and given the daily drudgery in life, we're never going to see enough of such reminders during trips to the movies to cop out from real life.<br/><br/>And of course a solid cast will help as well. We know Mark Wahlberg possesses that muscular killer body for some time already as he flaunts it in his previous films, in a build up to the role as Micky Ward, the Light Welterweight Champion at one point in his career. Tired of being nothing more than a stepping stone for other boxers to advance toward a title shot, you can't help but to feel sorry for him as his family, namely his mom Alice (Melissa Leo) and half brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), mismanages his career with their limited management skills, preferring to take quick routes so long as the dough can continue to come in.<br/><br/>It doesn't help of course with a really white trash type of family with no less than 7 sisters in tow forming an extended family to feed, always focusing on the tree and missing the forest out there. Wahlberg portrays Mickey with an understated anxiety as he worries about his getting on in the number of years, yet being stuck in the rut without light at the end of the tunnel, made worse by Dickie who seems to be putting his brother's career in jeopardy with his crack cocaine addiction, living on his past glories and that single famous fight against Sugar Ray Leonard. Possessing that steely determination only came later when he meets with the bargirl Charlene (Amy Adams) whom he falls in love with, and started to turn things around starting with standing up to his family.<br/><br/>Bale drops his weight once again to portray Dickie as that flamboyantly irresponsible trainer for Mickey, a good for nothing who disappears each time responsibility comes knocking. Bale truly takes his craft seriously, where The Fighter also refers to the rehabilitation and comeback not only of Mickey Ward in the professional arena over injury and a possible end to his career, but that of Dickie and that tremendous change to his life, being the boxing brain that his brother needs to tap on. The bookends here marks a complete about turn that only Bale can bring across convincingly, showing why he's one of the A-list performers of today, and I can't help but to chuckle each time he mouths off here, because of that now infamous tirade when making Terminator: Salvation.<br/><br/>Amy Adams also balances the testosterone charge in the movie, being the headstrong woman who doesn't accept the flak dished out by the Ward sisters, introducing the much needed clarity by an outsider in changing a non-productive regime for her lover to help me achieve a chance that title shot. If you think Adams can only star as demure characters, you'll change your opinion once you see this as she plays both naughty and nice. Like any family, the introduction of an outsider raises opportunities for tussling over their common loved one, and that perhaps took centerstage as well mid way through the film when Mickey's career is in the doldrums.<br/><br/>But what makes The Fighter stand out amongst its peers and competitors, and something which I have yet to see until now, are how the fights get choreographed and shot. Some ingenuity went into designing the bouts, putting the audience at ringside to the action, yet witnessing the battle unfold through another perspective, ala mimicking watching it through a sports television program in its presentation with commentary and without quick cutting bullshit. Beautifully filmed to make you feel as if you're lounging at home with beer in one hand and a remote on the other, with that ubiquitous montage sequence finding its way as well like most boxing films highlighting the boxer training hard at work, and nifty editing to demonstrate his many steps taken toward that championship fight.<br/><br/>Adding some glamour and real life personalities to raise authenticity of the film will be the presence of Sugar Ray Leonard and Mickey O'Keefe playing himself, the real life training at Mickey Ward's corner. Such stories may have been told countless of times before with different protagonists fighting their own demons and off the ring battles, but The Fighter delivers that solid knockout punch with its strong cast and direction. I'm hoping it goes in as the underdog this awards season and sucker punches the other contenders one way or another. Highly recommended as it works its way to my early shortlist of the best so far this year."

He lives in his brothers shadow which is understandable being the younger brother of someone who had some success but after he is screwed over by him and his mom so many times he finally breaks away for him. At this point i was really liking the movie. He starts to win and even wins a shot at the title, but then his brother comes back from jail clean, his brother is a crack head and had to go to jail where he got clean, so he wants his brother back training him over the people who got him there. He even sadly credits his brother for his wins. So even the movie about his life is still mostly about his brother.

"MartinHafer","9","3","7","23 March 2011"," Is this family THIS awful?!
","I would love to know more about Mickey Ward and his family. However, at the end of the film you see the real Mickey and his brother--so I assume it was made with complete cooperation of the family. This, despite the family appearing nearly 100% crazy--possibly too crazy for ""The Jerry Springer Show"" crazy!! However, when I looked on the internet, I really couldn't find anything that verified or refuted the portrayal of these folks. If this IS a realistic portrait, it is a wonderful argument for retroactive birth control or personal redemption--take your pick.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is a film about a relatively obscure (at least up until this film) boxing champ from 2000, Mickey Ward. Although his comeback is inspirational, the reason the film is compelling is that he apparently was raised by one of the most dysfunctional families I've ever seen in film--Mowgli was raised in a better family background than this one--at least according to the movie. I could say more but you really have to see this film--it says it all.<br/><br/>Ward's mother (Melissa Leo) and brother (Christian Bale) in action are pretty intense and interesting. Both of them received Supporting Actress/Actor Oscars for their parts. I wasn't as impressed by Leo's acting--screaming and acting trashy was interesting but that's about all there seemed to be to the character. However, Bale was incredible. Like most of his films, you can't hear any of his natural Welsh accent but what really impressed me was what he did to play this character--losing all that weight in order to look gaunt like a crack-head. Plus, he showed a nice range of acting in the film. It's worth seeing just for his performance.<br/><br/>As for Amy Adams in this film, this is NOT the Amy Adams of ""Enchanted""! In fact, it's about as far removed from this role or the one from ""Julie and Julia"" as you can find--as she plays a very earthy, crude and occasionally very unlikable character. Plus, seeing her in her underwear was a bit unnerving to me---I just kept thinking of her as a Disney princess gone bad! She was good in the film--just not exactly like I'd expected.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg apparently produced the film as well as acted in the lead. He was good, but frankly he didn't have a lot to do in the film other than box and let all the chaos happen around him. He simply went unnoticed, in a way, because so many wildly over-the-top performances surrounded him during practically every minute he was on film! <br/><br/>This is a well-made but often an unpleasant and very adult film--not nearly as arty as ""Raging Bull"" but very similar in content. And, if possible, even trashier...and like a slow-motion train wreck at times as you watch the family in action. Fortunately, late in the film there are some glimmers of hope...some."
"jzappa","7","3","7","30 December 2010"," A Typical Ego Validation Sports Drama Done with Particular Flare and Raw Intimacy
","This heated, pulpy comeback tale about folks who've seen too many of those is quite a customary ringside drama, which in itself is not essentially a condescending assertion. This subgenre's a hard-wearing one and, when done effectively, is extremely involving, predictably upsurging to an encouraging feel-good finish. So by most measures, this highly textural work's done particularly, extremely well.<br/><br/>It's the story of a real-life boxer whose career was revived in the late '90's, Mickey Ward, in a physically hard-hitting but emotionally subtle take by Mark Wahlberg. The movie comprises the time before that renaissance, as he strains to choose whether or not to keep his family engaged in his career, chiefly his manager mother, played in another of Melissa Leo's powerfully indomitable, matter-of-fact performances, and his fellow boxer and trainer half-brother Dicky, played by a bizarrely compelling Christian Bale, and his astonishingly intolerant, self-absorbed sisters, whose presence gives Mickey that extra boost of respect from us, as it must've been hell's seventh circle growing up in an isolated household with them.<br/><br/>He's swayed to abandon their control by his new girlfriend Charlene, played by an increasingly more impressive Amy Adams. As with several of these movies, the story's not about the sport itself, but instead about the athlete's private ordeals. Here it divulges a depiction of the hurdles and hazards of mingling family with partnership. All actors concerned bestow an emotional thrust that advances toward overflow, director David O. Russell, who ordinarily makes heady comedies, confidently tells a forthright story here. And although I don't have any concrete grievances about this sensationalistic urban fable, from beginning to end it seems exceptionally susceptible to formula exhaustion.<br/><br/>It's one of these movies where two iconic leading men reveal to have endured arduous physical transformations out of Method dedication to their roles, as urban tough guys in an insular neighborhood, tackling big dreams, magnetizing relentlessly supportive women in an obsessive, violent battle for general respect. There are emotional training montages set to alternative rock (kudos for using the Chili Peppers), perilous drug habits, borderline-operatic arguments comprised entirely out of 'Bahston' brogues, the trading of insults. There's some innate attraction men have to this material, even apart from its sports-driven subject matter, the notion that the jingoistic warmth of blinkered urban neighborhoods such as these when romanticized on film is appealing, or that men feel they can or aspire to match the resolute gristle of the characters.<br/><br/>But the reason this very simple, somewhat tired story's particularly effective's largely due to the authenticity of every character, the cast so strappingly, affectionately worthy as they aim at the brawls that occur among family. Russell has taken a fable of legendary American redemption and one of those Hollywood scripts with way too many writers and come what may fashioned a film so stimulating, genuine and alive with knotty emotions that is feels like a fresh experience. The whole cast pours out remarkably moving performances. If they inevitably spill over the top, Russell's visceral balancing act allows it to feel like just another part of the insulated world he's furnished.<br/><br/>Using mostly hand-held cameras, he gives the impression that we're mingling with great curiosity, and it's left purely to his actors to spin the yarn. With its extraordinarily personal temperament that frankly is what makes the movie, Wahlberg and Bale take what could effortlessly become mere stylized pigeonholes and give the story not simply some severity but an unbridled showcase of masculine energy. An interesting aspect is that on the surface, it seems we're supposed to be compelled to lend the spotlight to Bale's bombastic rendering of an inimitably, compulsively watchable character, but it's Wahlberg whose unassuming, tightly internalized performance seems to be dividing critics, which is frankly a good sign, as a figure at odds between his allegiance to the tribe and his duty to himself.<br/><br/>Everyone involved seems to simply be letting go: Adams is getting a lot of kudos here because she seems so uncannily secure in a very atypically tough role, one that could've easily been yet another token supportive love interest but, owing to her, is a fully amplified character in the classic sense. And after an anti-war treasure hunt film set in the '91 Iraq uprising and a sociopolitical comedy about philosophy and the meaning of life, Russell seems keen to go back to basics, telling a guileless, unadorned story from the ground up. Even Hoyte van Hoytema, whose delicately measured minimalist lensing of Let the Right One In won him accolades, just hoists the camera onto his shoulder to follow the actors around.<br/><br/>Indeed the camera seems to behave similarly to its crassly masculine subjects, confrontationally rushing headlong into close-ups, weaving bumpily past bystanders and panning or tracking either smoothly or explosively depending on the mood it's reacting to. I was also impressed by the moving rendering of Ward's boxing matches, created in a rigorous procedural fashion with real-life commentary and shot with the same Beta-format cameras from early '90s sports broadcasts, giving the scenes a very certain look and a liberty from the inevitable comparisons to the fight sequences in Raging Bull and The Wrestler.<br/><br/>So this forceful, consciously in-depth movie, perhaps one of the year's best acting vehicles, wears its heart on its sleeve, but with such a nitty-gritty, aggressively naturalistic style, eschews being syrupy. All of its clichés are simply part of the reality about these characters and the world that the dedicated cast and crew are concerned with illustrating, and its ultimate messiness feels more like a surplus of seratonin than shoddy writing. Therefore, it's an especially uncomplicated movie, and it's trouble-free to write off as merely another sports flick about conquering odds, especially when the conclusion of the film leaves much unresolved, but it's also an especially intimate movie, which is much more valuable."

","To say this was as predictable as boxing itself, possibly the most fixed sport of them all, is a gross understatement. I may have been in suspense watching this at age 5.

I also didn't like ""Rocky"". I tend to dislike the movies that most other people like - anything based on a comic book or a sequel or TV show is usually drivel that I expect to be below contempt.

"Buddy-51","9","2","4","12 April 2011"," a knockout punch
","Based on a true story, David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" is a knockout sports drama filled with finely drawn characters and crackerjack performances. The movie netted two of its actors – Christian Bale and Melissa Leo – a pair of richly deserved Best Supporting Oscars for their efforts.<br/><br/>In the role he was clearly born to play, Mark Wahlberg stars as Micky Ward, a welterweight boxer who, after quite a few years in the ring already, is still trying to make a name for himself as a fighter. Perhaps the greatest hindrances to Micky's success are his mother, Alice (Leo), and his older brother, Dicky (Bale), the former a hard-living, tough-talking broad who takes it upon herself to manage – and mismanage - her son's career, and the latter, a crack-addicted has-been pugilist himself whose one claim to fame is taking out Sugar Ray Leonard in a bout in 1978 (Leonard makes a brief appearance as himself in the film). Now Micky is beginning to question whether he wouldn't be better off just cutting the family ties altogether and taking charge of his own affairs, especially when a well-reputed professional trainer offers to take him on as a client. But how will that sit with a mother and a boatload of siblings who prize familial loyalty above all else? <br/><br/>Set in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1993, ""The Fighter"" brings its low-income, working-class milieu to vivid life. In addition to the thick Boston accents and mercilessly teased hair, ""The Fighter"" features what is probably the strangest, least ""Hollywood"" looking cast of secondary players I've ever seen in a mainstream movie. This is particularly the case with the women cast to play Micky and Dicky's seven unmarried sisters, all apparently still living at home, who serve as a kind of roving posse, eager to avenge any slights made against the family honor by outside forces, including Micky's highly opinionated new girlfriend, the tough-as-nails bartender Charlene (the superb Amy Adams), who isn't about to back down from this band of screeching white-trash banshees when it comes to doing what she thinks is best for Micky.<br/><br/>So dazzled are we by the riveting, award-winning performances of Bale and Leo that Wahlberg's beautifully understated work as Micky could easily get lost in the shadows. But it is he who gives the movie its emotional center, turning Micky into a character whose fate and welfare we come to care deeply about. If nothing else, his subtle, self-effacing way of coping with all the craziness and drama taking place around him provides a necessary counterweight to the showier performances - and immediately puts us in his corner. It also helps that Micky is being torn in so many different directions at once, when all he really wants is to finally get a chance at a title bout. Jack McGee, the roly-poly fire chief from ""Rescue Me,"" also scores as Micky's tirelessly supportive father, George.<br/><br/>There's a definite toughness and a take-no-prisoners mentality to this clan, but also a closeness and a strangely admirable loyalty among its members that go a long way towards smoothing out some of those rougher edges. They're not necessarily people one would want to meet or have much to do with in real life, but as characters in a drama, they sure are fascinating to watch."

"seaview1","9","2","4","25 February 2011"," Heart and Soul of THE FIGHTER
","OK, you may think, ""another boxing film about a nobody who becomes somebody"", right? Don't underestimate The Fighter as another boxing film. It has heart and good acting, but most of all, it is authentic. This film purposely avoids sentiment and going for easy, weepy moments. Rocky this is not. This pet project of producer and star Mark Wahlberg has been years in the making and the payoff here is a gallery of great performances by talented actors who do justice to their real life counterparts.<br/><br/>This true story centers on boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who struggles to be a junior welterweight champion with training by his half-brother and former fighter, Dicky Ekland (an emaciated Christian Bale). Dicky lives his dashed dreams through Micky and has his own problems with drug addiction and other criminal activities. The extended family includes a supportive father and a controlling mother, Alice (Melissa Leo). Micky's life changes when he meets a bartender, Charlene (Amy Adams), who believes in him. When the opportunity comes to take his career to the next level and work with professional trainers and management in Las Vegas, Micky's relationship with Dicky is jeopardized and causes a mighty rift with his family especially his 'manager' Alice who feels betrayed. To make matters worse, Dicky gets in trouble with the law and must serve prison. He still lives in the past, clinging to memories of boxing Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978. Micky is so torn when a seemingly winnable fight switches his intended opponent to one who is much heavier at the last minute, that he contemplates quitting altogether. Riddled with guilt, he becomes reclusive until Charlene intercedes. He begins to fight again and amasses a series of wins until he is one step away from a championship if he can overcome a challenger, Sanchez, and Dicky offers tips on how to fight him. Faced with a chance to really make something of his career, Micky must choose between his new handlers and Dicky who taught him everything he knows about boxing. It could mean a championship in the end.<br/><br/>The film works on different levels of relationships: Micky and Charlene, Micky and his family, but most of all the film rests on the bond between the two brothers. There is a good sense of family life and local flavor. Micky and Dicky grew up local athletes and resident celebrities of sorts in a blue collar town where everybody knows each other. When Micky and Charlene challenge Alice, there is a tumultuous change of dynamics and a tense battle of wills. The best scene and also a turning point in the story happens when Dicky confronts Charlene about her own shortcomings, and everything in a way comes full circle as each person must look within to missed opportunities and not achieving their dreams. It is an honest, pivotal moment that validates Dicky's character who, surprisingly, still knows a thing or two about boxing. Ironically Micky and Dicky's scenes recall Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger as brothers in On the Waterfront also about a washed up fighter.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are quite convincing and well edited, and when you have a well chiseled actor like Wahlberg (The Departed), a kind of modern day John Garfield, you accept him as a boxer without question. Bale (The Dark Knight) really inhabits his portrayal of a proverbial loser, and he looks the part having shed substantial weight. Was this once the boy who enchanted us in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? Come to think of it, Spielberg has another young alumnus in Adams (Catch Me If You Can) who makes the most of her role as a bright, headstrong woman who supports Micky and butts heads with Alice and her daughters literally. Leo (Frozen River) is quite good as the proud matriarch whose influence and authority is threatened.<br/><br/>The film tells its story as directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings) in workman like manner. It's almost the kind of film Clint Eastwood makes these days. The story and relationships are strong enough to easily carry the film without resorting to sentimentality. Indeed, there is a thrilling moment ringside where a shot almost follows through with Alice and Charlene hugging, but Russell cuts away to another unglamorous shot. Bravo for not taking the easy way out although there are a couple of scenes could have been extended more. It's also nice to see the real life brothers in the end credits, and you know that the film has done their lives justice. The original screenplay and story had a lot of writers involved, and the result is a heck of a remarkable comeback story and a family that would not quit."
"cantony258","8","2","4","24 February 2011"," How many boxing movies do we need? Apparently, never enough!
","How many boxing movies do we need? Apparently, never enough! And is every boxing movie an Oscar contender? It seems so. Some have compared The Fighter to Rocky and Cinderella Man. Boxing and the underdog overcoming obstacles would be the two themes that run common between the three movies. I've also heard it's similar to Raging Bull, but I can't say anything on that as I haven't seen the particular film.<br/><br/>The Fighter has a simple plot. Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) wants a boxing title.<br/><br/>Micky Ward always stood in the shadows of his older brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale). Dickie was once a title contender, who's moment of fame was knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard, but has since become a crack-addict. Though 15 years have passed since that knock-out, Dickie lives daily in that story's repetition and the dream of having a come-back. A camera crew is following Dickie to chronicle the effects of cocaine, but Dickie and his family believes the documentary is about his comeback. Dickie played such a strong role, I didn't realize Micky was the main character of the movie for the first hour or so! Between Dickie and their Mom (Melissa Leo), Micky was submissively suffocating in the shadows, all the while allowing himself to be used in the selfish gains of his Mom and brother. With the help of his girlfriend, Charlene (Amy Adams), Micky develops some backbone and finds clarity to his life. He pulls himself away from his overwhelming, tight-knit and crazy family and starts training. Getting to that point of growing a backbone and standing up for himself was quite the internal struggle for Micky, which the movie does a very good job of depicting.<br/><br/>Behind every great man is a great woman. The mother is a great woman gone bad. You know that she means well. She really loves her family and wants to keep the family together. The desire of seeing her boys rise to fame started as selfless devotion but turned into selfish self-fulfillment. It blinds her from truth and reality. She turns a blind eye to Dickie's drug addiction and failures and refuses to face the truth that a real manager could provide better opportunity for Micky. But her character brings the meat to the movie - the story of family, commitment and tenacity. Charlene, on the other hand, is a great woman. She really supports Micky and wants what is good for him. At one point, she started going down that path of ruin that the mother started on at some point, but with the help of Dickie (suprise!), she comes back to her senses.<br/><br/>Marl Wahlberg gave an acceptable performance. Perhaps it would seem more impressive if Christian Bale hadn't dominated the screen. He completely owned his character. I'm not a fan of him as a person, but I can't help but be amazed by his passion and skill for acting. He dropped a lot of weight to the point that he looks morosely ill with thin balding hair and brown teeth. The way he talked, walked, ran, interacted... I had to keep reminding myself that this was Christian Bale I was watching, much like how I keep reminding myself that I'm watching Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Yes, that's right. I'm comparing Bale's performance to Brando. Only in this instance, though. You realize fully what a superb job Bale did when you see the real Dickie during the closing credits. Bale is my horse for that Oscar race. Amy Adams did a very believable performance. She was gumption and grit with a good dose of sexy.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the direction of this film. Every scene had such life, grit and realism to it. Very commendable, to say the least. The cackle of sisters and family life brought a good touch of humor to the otherwise serious movie.<br/><br/>While The Fighter is generally categorized as a boxing movie, there's so much more to it than the sport. It portrayed the life of a working-class/poor family's struggles; the good, the bad and the ugly of a tight knit family; and how far tenacious determination can really take you."

","The Fighter  I have to say all of the hype and advertising for this film was not  just hype without substance. This well done sports drama is directed by  David O. Russell (three kings, I heart the huckabees). There is plenty  of substance to go around staring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale,  Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams.   The well done film is based on the life and times of junior  welterweight Irish boxer Mickey ward and his brother dickey a has been  fighter in his own right who had one claim to fame supposedly knocking  down sugar ray Lenard. Mickey is part time boxer from the small town of  Lowell Massachusetts trying to make it big is managed by his chain  smoking mother Alice Ward played by Golden globe winner (Melissa Leo)  Mickey's biggest problem is that he hasn't be able to put aside his  feeling for his family for what's best for his career as a fighter.  His crack smoking Brother Dickey and his mom seem try to take control  his career. As a way to make up for the screw up they had with dickey's  life and career. The performances from mark Wahlberg, Golden globe  nominated actor's Christian bale and Melissa Leo has live up to the  hype for their nominations for acting and film awards. To make things  more interesting for momma Mickey takes up with beautiful bartender  Charlene Fleming played by Amy Adams. She tries to convince Mickey to  take an offer to train ft and get paid in Vegas. The family becomes  very over protective of their little meal ticket and tries and bullies  the family outsider. It made for a good scene on the porch of her house   The back drop of the town was home run it was a perfect setting a back  drop for the story of a regular guy trying to make it big in the boxing  world. The biggest part of the acting for me is Mr. Christian bale. He  has never to shy away from the type of roles that seem stretch him as  an actor. He took to his role as crack addicted ex boxer perfectly. He  gets thrown in jail in one part of the film and has to dry out from all  of the drugs... just a wow scene.  I really think this movie deserves all of the press it's getting for an  Oscar. The screen play, cast, setting of film is a tremendous film. It  is winner and a must see. I give it 4 stars."
"Argemaluco","10","2","4","18 February 2011"," A splendid film
","I am not a fan of boxing, but I understand the irresistible attraction it exercises on many people, including filmmakers who try to capture all the drama, pain and passion generated into the ring in the big screen. Boxing is an undoubtedly difficult sport, which cannot be practiced by anybody; and even though it requires many sacrifices, it can also offer extraordinary rewards (at least under Hollywood's affected interpretation). So, the best movies about boxing have a perfect combination of emotion, drama and action...as we can now see in The Fighter, an extraordinary film which departs a little bit from the formula, but without ignoring the traditional elements which can make this sub-genus to be cathartic and satisfactory.<br/><br/>In films like Rocky, Cinderella Man and The Wrestler, the fight in the ring is a metaphor of the real fight from the main character, either if it is for going out of poverty, for showing his personal value or for recovering the dignity which was snatched to him by life in other aspects. But in The Fighter, the fights are a peripheral element, because the real conflict is not on the ring, but in the modest suburbs from Lowell, Massachussets, where the characters must face emotional disputes and take hard decisions which will deeply affect their future as well as their family. Do not misunderstand me...the fights are fantastically filmed, and they brought me great moments of hope, tragedy and suspense. But the most memorable scenes (at least by my point of view) were not the punching, falls and miraculous recoveries, but the dramatic confrontations from the main character with his brother, his mother, his trainers, his girlfriend, and other people who only wanna see him triumphing, even though they do not coincide in the way he must take to achieve it.<br/><br/>Before watching The Fighter, I was fearing that it would be a simple boxing rehash of the brilliant film The Wrestler, which was directed by Darren Aronofsky; and my fears were accentuated when I found out that Aronofsky himself was a co-producer of The Fighter. However, after having watched this movie, I have to say that there is nothing to fear of...even though both films have a vaguely similar story, their style and atmosphere are very different. The only things they have in common are the high quality from the performances and the emotional impact they provoked on me. Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale bring excellent performances, and the acclamation they both received is absolutely deserved. The supporting cast also made a perfect work, starting by Melissa Leo and Amy Adams as the mother and the lover (respectively) from the main character. I also liked the work from Jack McGee very much. And finally, the unknown actresses who interpret the 7 daughters from the Ward family also made a brilliant work, and they bring some of the most dramatic and also some of the most humorous moments from this movie.<br/><br/>I also liked the previous work from director David O. Russell, but I think that The Fighter is definitely his best movie so far. One of the things I most liked from The Fighter is the style employed by him, which is fluid and dynamic but at the same time incredibly thorough, capturing the big dramatic moments as well as the small and eloquent details which fill in the narrative holes from the story's periphery with a casual precision, enriching the narrative and increasing the dramatic weight from every scene. It is like watching a story through a filmmaker's eyes; it supposedly should be always like that, but while I was watching The Fighter, I noticed that that is unfortunately something that rarely happens. In conclusion, The Fighter is a splendid film which deserves a highly enthusiastic recommendation for succeeding so much in every single aspect."

Mark Wahlberg plays his part perfectly, however all credit has to go to Christian Bale. This is method acting at its best. It will be a crime if he doesn't win an award for this performance. He steals every scene he is in and does it so well he really is just unrecognisable as Christian Bale.

And there are the demons, drug addiction, the egos, the money and pride. It is far from a comedy but you will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, and you will never forget Christian Bale's performance or Mark Whalberg's fight scenes. Melissa Leo shines as the mother of the two, sorry the mother of the nine. I just never knew: should I love her or hate her, and that makes her character so wonderful. There is a big heart hanging over this character based and passionately made film, you sense the love and loyalty, you sense brotherhood, ambition and triumph.

","Not having read anything about the film, but attracted by the fact that it was a David O. Russell's movie, based loosely on a real life story involving two half-brothers that have spent time in the boxing ring, we decided we had to see it. Having enjoyed the director's wonderful ""Three Kings"", ""Flirting With Disaster"", and ""Spanking the Monkey"", was enough to sell us into going. We were pleasantly surprised by what it turned out to be one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>The brothers from depressed Lowell, Massachussets, are at the center of the story. Dicky Eklund is the older brother, and Mickey Ward the youngest. Dicky boxing career took a turn for the worst when he fell prey to drugs that almost ruined his life. Mickey Ward wanted to follow his brothers into the ring, but he was considered not to have what it took in order to make it into the big fights.<br/><br/>The brothers have a powerful mother in Alice, who, in addition, has raised seven other girls that are part of the dysfunctional family. Dicky's addiction takes a heavy toll on him; not only is he a loser, he is a mess. Mickey, on the other hand, realizes his brother was a great fighter who was able to win over Sugar Ray Leonard, but crack smoking got in his way. Mickey worshiped his brother and knew he needed him on his side if he wanted to make a name for himself.<br/><br/>Mickey sets his eye in putting Dicky's excellent style to use, if he wants to make it all the way to the top. Having fallen for Charlene, the tough bartender at the bar he frequents, he angers Alice, who cannot take the young woman with a mind of her own. Charlene has been around the neighborhood to know the family secrets. Mickey decides to accept the offer to train in Las Vegas, backed by a professional team, but in doing so, he realizes he needs Dicky more than he thought.<br/><br/>The best thing in the film is the way Mr. Russell got the stellar performances out of his strong cast. Christian Bale is a chameleon; he gets into Dicky Eklund with relish in one of his best appearances in film. The wonderful Mellissa Leo makes Alice come to life in all her glory. We have known women like her; she makes us believe she is none other than the mother who is champion for the sport of boxing, as well as a supporter for her children. The real surprise in the picture is Amy Adams, who up to now has played naive and uncomplicated characters in her movie career. As Charlene, she shows a remarkable strength going out of type to give one of her best displays as an actress in any of her films. Mark Wahlberg, unfortunately plays the weakest role and he is outdone by his cast members.<br/><br/>The production was vividly photographed by Hoyte Van Hoytema who captures the excitement of the bouts as well as the poverty of Lowell. Mark Wahlberg ought to be congratulated in the way he has backed several worthwhile projects, as well as being one of the producers of this amazing film. David O. Russell keeps surprising with each new effort."
"the-movie-guy","10","2","4","13 January 2011"," Most of the fighting takes place outside of the ring

Micky's trainer is his half-brother, former boxer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), who fought Sugar Ray Leonard. Micky must live up to his brother's famous fight, even though the brother lost the fight, served time in prison, struggles with drug addiction, and is not a very good trainer. With the help of his girlfriend (Amy Adams) and another trainer, Micky finally begins to win fights and gets a shot at a title fight.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is your typical fight movie where the underdog, just like Rocky, gets his chance at being the champion. Micky must not only struggle with sparring with his brother, but he must overcome his manager-mother, who gets him fights he can't win. Micky's family is his biggest opponent and obstacle, because most of the fighting takes place outside of the ring. The story focuses on his relationships that hurt and harm him, and the journey he takes to the title fight. This is a strong boxing film that will be a contender when awards are announced. Remember, this is a realistic fight movie, and therefore it is a violent one. (Paramount Pictures, Run Time 1:55, Rated R)(10/10)"

"montera_iulian","9","2","4","7 January 2011"," Hollywood had a true story of someone that did not BECAME SOMEONE but ACHIEVED SOMETHING
","This biopic is not only a film about boxing but also an in-depth description of a suburban family. As the title says, the story is developed around Micky Ward's (Mark Wahlberg) professional career as a welterweight boxer and the personal issues that he had to face during his chase for success. I would like to mention though another fighter because I had the feeling that I witnessed two fighters struggling for their personal merit and that is Micky's brother, the former welterweight boxer, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, a boxer who lives in his brother's shadow. He struggles to find his mental and physic balance to achieve great things professionally but has a hard time ""thanks"" to his family. Although he is ambitions and strong, he has a weakness for his family. He is close to his brother, Dicky, he listens to his mother Alice, which is also manager and he loves Charlene, a girl he met up in a bar. Being emotionally too much involved he has a hard time dealing with everyone. Alice, played extraordinary by Melissa Leo, is a garrulous mother, egocentric and irascible person, jealous and actually possessive. Amy Adams plays Charlene, a more educated and reasonable girl who devotes herself and spends all her energy trying to make Micky get on his track and regain his confidence after a couple of losses. Jack McGee plays Micky's father, George Ward, a more calmer and thoughtful person than anyone under Ward's roof.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of this movie however is Christian Bale's impersonation of Dicky Eklund. Dicky is a guy who lives in the past, building his whole life on one fight he had 14 years ago with Sugar Ray Leonard. He becomes a social mess by diving into the world of drugs and creating conflicts from mediocre situations. Because he is his brother's personal hero his positive influence and his training methods become easily affected by his negativity and his lousy character. Bale's performance is a colossal achievement this year and definitely deserves an academy award because not only he adapted his accent and behavior but he also managed to adapt his physical portrayal, his physical gestures. He is solely unrecognizable as Bale but only as Dicky. Not only these characters seem to have nothing in common so fights obviously would break but you have to see these other figures which are Micky's siblings, all sisters. They all act like a bunch of sheep or oompa-loompas trolling around the house making things more crazy than they already are. These character problems are part of the suburban environment they all grew up. Without a proper education and a social solid structure they will manage to reveal at some point more of the worst than the best. Now, I said in the beginning that I saw Dicky as being a fighter also. That is correct because thanks to Dicky's good will and ambition we see him fight his condition and return from jail (because that's where he ends up some time in the story) to help his brother become one thing he never was: a champion.<br/><br/>Technically the movie has its ups and downs. I didn't really enjoy that much the fighting scenes. I think they could have presented them in a different way. Other than that, it is pretty well edited, good cinematography involved but I kinda felt the lack of music. There is melody and there are songs chosen as backgrounds for training or for a certain fight but other than that it's a pretty technical flat film. I think the director and the crew concentrated more on the story and the acting than on the technical details and that served out to be a very good thing to do.<br/><br/>I don't have to say nothing at the end but to thank Dicky's struggle, to thank Charlene for her affection and advices she gave and to ultimately thank Micky's ambition and heart because now Hollywood had a true story of someone that did not BECAME SOMEONE but ACHIEVED SOMETHING. After all, you could become someone but are you guaranteed you'll achieve something?"

He finds confidence in his new girlfriend, college drop-out Charlene (Amy Adams), a brazen, young vixen who is not willing to let Micky squander his gifts in the ring for a family he can't rely on.<br/><br/>This aptly named film is not just about boxing, let alone just about Micky Ward. It's about fighting to survive, fighting for love, for honor, and family. This is a film about the bond between brothers, between mothers and sons, husbands and wives, boxers and trainers. There are so many levels and ways to look at this film. Micky's struggles to achieve in the ring, Dicky's struggles with drug addiction, the list goes on.<br/><br/>One thing that is clearly evident here is the painstaking attention to detail that Russell takes in creating the world that Micky Ward boxed in. Filming at the very same gym Micky trained at, using the same cameras and crews that HBO Boxing used to film Micky's fights, and even casting one of Micky's trainers Mickey O'Keefe to play himself. It reminded me of Gus van Sant's Milk where van Sant used many shots from the documentary The Times of Harvey Milk and other television segments to recreate the feel and especially the look of Harvey Milk's San Francisco. Russell takes it even further with Dicky's life and includes the HBO documentary made featuring Dicky in the early 90s. (I won't give the title, but you can view it on snagfilms.com)<br/><br/>To back up this realism you need real, raw performances from the entire cast. For me, the success of the film lies on Wahlberg, without his commitment to the physical component of Micky's character and also his personality, the film would fail. He is supported by an incredibly cast, all of which give Oscar worthy performances, especially Bale. Bale's transformation into a wandering, drug addicted delinquent is something to see. His uneasiness on camera fits his character so well.<br/><br/>The two supporting females both surprised me from the start. I knew of Leo from Frozen River, an indie darling two years back garnering her an Oscar nod. Adams I had known from several films, including one of my favorites of two years back, Doubt. They both take off the gloves and get real dirty for this one. Leo looks like the poster child for 90s hairdos while Adams thick, nasty accent comes straight from the North Shore of Mass. Watching the two go at it on screen is fantastic. They really hit their marks.<br/><br/>At the end of the film we are shown a glimpse of the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, following the shooting of the film. As if we needed more of a reason to love their performances, here we see exactly where Wahlberg and Bale drew their inspiration from. Their acting is spot on, another tribute to their devotion to the film."
"postette","9","2","4","2 January 2011"," The ""Rocky"" of its generation
","I went into this film expecting it to be more about the performances than about the plot. I left this film expecting it to be the top contender for a Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>A lot has been written about the performances in this film, so I won't spend long on that. The two performances that stand out for me are Melissa Leo as Alice and Christian Bale as Dicky. Both powerhouse performances deserving Oscar nods, if not wins.<br/><br/>The thing that separates this film from other underdog sports films is that it delves into the character's strained relationships with his mother and brother and the writers and actors were not afraid of making those two latter characters gritty, real, and not wholly likable. This movie's biggest strength was how real it felt. How many of us have strained relationships within our family? How many of us have that one relative (or more), that just keeps bringing us down in life, but whom we have a hard time separating ourselves from out of family loyalties? I do not know if the crew went to the real neighborhood that Micky Ward grew up in or if they filmed elsewhere, but the set locations that were chosen were just as pivotal to the story as the performances. They help to establish and remind us that the Micky Ward we meet is by no means a rich man financially, while allowing the story more time to focus on the fact that he is also not a rich man in any other sense of the word. A beautiful house in suburbia where Ward's ex-wife lives is in stark contrast to the upstairs apartment in which he lives. A crack house, just down the street from what looks to be a church...wow! What a powerful image.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call this a light-hearted drama at all, but it did have some unexpected laughs...my favorite one involving an intercom.<br/><br/>There were few flaws in this film, but the biggest ones I found involved the sisters . The sisters were a creepy lot (some of the them looked older than their mother, which added to the creepiness factor), and not well cast. Even in smaller supporting roles, a well-cast part can make a difference. I don't think it is going out on a limb in saying that I believe some of the sisters were locals and not professional actors. I know I recognized at least one from Gone Baby Gone and her acting didn't impress me in that film, either, being more a distraction in the scenes she appeared in than a help. The sisters did have their funny moments, needless to say, but I actually thought the film wouldn't have suffered if he had had fewer of them around in the film (no offense to any of Micky's real sisters).<br/><br/>All in all, though, as I say in my summary title, I think this film is this generation's Rocky, just with a spunkier version of Adrian and a bit more realism and dysfunction thrown in."
"anarresa","8","2","4","18 December 2010"," Great Movie
","This was far more than the inspirational sports movie whose category it may fall under, though in that respect it satisfies as well. It was darker and funnier and deeper than the previews indicated. Both the sport and family fights of boxers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund are dramatized here, along with a striking representation of working class Lowell. This is where much of the humor came in, at least for the Worcester, MA audience. The Eklund/Ward family are a bit of a caricature, chain smoking and full of attitude and profanity, but so very close to the truth we all saw a relative, friend, neighbor, ourselves. The close knit neighborhood communities are also shown. Pick your MA city and the movie could have been filmed there. It could translate to other locales, but if not the story itself is still great. Every major character was portrayed excellently. I was surprised by Wahlberg's gravity (and fantastic physique, if you're interested) and Adams' grittiness. I was also reminded of Bale's talent, there was a clip in the credit of the real Eklund and Bale was spot-on. Action, drama, humor and redemption come together for one of the best movies of the year."

","Dicky Eklund is by far and away the best character in this movie - it would've been a crime if Christian Bale had not won an Oscar for this role. Unfortunately I wasn't so impressed by Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of the protagonist Micky Ward, who had both the emotional range and personality of a teaspoon. His character was so bland that in fact in the final fight scene - the welterweight championship bout - I found myself indifferent as to who won. Nonetheless this was still an excellent film, and David O. Russell's use of TV cameras during the fight scenes was unique and ingenious, giving The Fighter an edge over a myriad of other boxing flicks. Overall 9/10 (7 or 8 if it hadn't been for Bale)."

Great soundtrack, fine visuals, masterful fight scenes and naturally the actors. Christian Bale always gets the credit no matter which role he is given - he's a wonderful actor, gorgeous performer as well as a natural born transformer - he just dives into his characters head on. In ""The Fighter"" he shines the brightest although being a supporting character but that fact shouldn't mislead you into believing that other actors aren't doing enough. Mark Wahlberg has his moments of greatness, as well as Amy Adams who both are absolutely terrific in this picture and have pleasantly surprised me with their outstanding performances. This movie is about family matters, it speaks very loudly about them, and the choices we make to be the best we can while trying not to hurt someone else in the process.

","""The Fighter"" is directed by David O Russell and stars Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. This film is based on a true story about two brothers trying to get a shot at the title in boxing.<br/><br/>David O Russell tells this heartfelt story and brotherly love and family relationships, making hard choices to achieve greatness in a really compelling story.<br/><br/>Christian Bale delivers a stellar performance as Dickie Eklund, the older brother of Micky Ward (Wahlberg). Dickie is Micky's trainer and a lightweight boxer as well, now a crack addict and a troubled man. Seen by Bale's performance as Dickie, you can really see and tell that Dickie loves his younger brother. Both of them have a good relationship, despite their differences. The whole family is very close together, and all support Micky is his rise in boxing. Especially his mother, Alice Ward, played brilliantly by Melissa Leo.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very interesting in this film, in clever ways. They dry colours give the film a realistic feel, gritty and raw. While the boxing matches are happening, they are filmed like the fights are being broadcasted on real TV. David O Russell used camera from the 90s to give the matches a realistic feeling, like they were live on TV at the time, which is a clever way of doing it.<br/><br/>The rock induced soundtrack fits well with the film as well.<br/><br/>One problem I have with the film is that some of the characters weren't portrayed as real as they were in real life. According to sources, the real Dickie Eklund didn't like how his sisters were portrayed, and yelled at a Christian Bale, although Bale spent hours with the real Dickie to learn how to portray him accurately, and he did a fine job.<br/><br/>Overall, The Fighter is a great film to enjoy, especially if you have siblings, seeing Dickie and Micky connect like real brothers is something to behold, despite everything they went through."

","Remember David O. Russell? The emotionally volatile film director turned Hollywood wonder-boy who had a string of back to back Oscar nominated films in the early part of the decade. Touted by many as the next Scorsese, Russell's films cast a spell on the filmgoing public. Perhaps some of that was all apart of a ruse. Silver Lining's Playbook is a good adaptation of a great novel, but too forgettable to be a masterpiece and too corny to be as heart-wrenching as it wanted to be. In 2013, I was smitten by American Hustle, which rattled my brain for what I thought was a GoodFellas of the new millennium. What I now realize is how manipulative and stylistic of an experiment that movie was. You might as well have sold it in can titled ""I Can't Believe it's Not Scorsese!"". This all culminated in Joy, a self important mess of a film. The spell was broken. By that point, David O. Russell was reduced to a man of plastic realities, and nobody ever heard from him again. So, as I sat down to watch The Fighter, I noticed something. Truthfully, this is the best film that David O. Russell has ever made. One that made him a top-tier filmmaker to watch. Ironically, this is his least plastic, stylistic and frilly movie of his catalogue. His brilliant gifts as a filmmaker come alive and in full color when he just tells a real story, with real characters. That's what The Fighter is.<br/><br/>It's the story of Micky and Dicky Ward. Dick is ""the pride of Lowell"", or he was, until he got hooked on crack. Long gone is his heyday of beating Sugar Ray in the ring. He's just another Mass townie. His brother Micky looks up to him, for it's his turn to re-fill the shoes that Dicky left behind. Micky wants to break out all on his own. He wants to be a champ. But he's stuck living in Dicky's shadow, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that Dicky is a human train-wreck who constantly needs bailing out. If that weren't enough, Micky's mother is his own manager, and his endless army of sisters fight for his attention. Micky is drowning in family. This affects his ability to fight. But what keeps Micky going is a beautiful bartender named Charlene, who's the only one that makes him feel like someone.<br/><br/>David O. Russell clearly knows what makes boxing movies work. He's clearly seen Raging Bull. The man behind the glove is what really powers the punch. In Micky's case, every day is a knockout. Russell focuses like a laser on these characters. Places them in depth and fully establishes their motivations. Moreover, these are real people. Nobody overacts here. There's simply no need. It's a tour-de-force in that sense. Do I even need to mention Christian Bale? This is his best on-screen role by a mile. It's interesting how this film even includes the HBO crew that was filming the life and times of Micky and Dicky during the course of this story. In a way, it's almost as if that crew left the cameras on and we are getting to see the raw footage of what they got. It's that genuine of a product. That's more than anyone has ever said about David O. Russell's other films, and maybe that was what has been missing all along."

","The story of Micky ""Irish"" Ward and his boxing career with his crack addicted brother at his side. Apparently Marky Mark was so hell bent on getting this film made that he stayed in ""shape"" for years and years just in case the film went into production. That's dedication and passion for you, yet the man still manages to be the weak link.<br/><br/>It's not really his fault, David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. Christian Bale plays Dicky Ecklund, Micky's crack addicted brother who tells the same story over and over again, about him knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. It's his claim to fame. There is a film crew following him around, he thinks it's going to be about his comeback, yet it's really about the harsh realities of crack addiction. Bale, again, submerses himself in the role. He is pure method. You can not like him as a person, or even an actor, but you can't deny his passion for the art. He is on the thin side again, with thin balding hair and brown teeth. He looks deathly ill in every scene. The man has one of his finest roles to date and will no doubt be nominated come award season. I hope he actually takes home the award. He is without a doubt, the most interesting character in the film.<br/><br/>Their mother is played by Melissa Leo, another performance worthy of recognition come award season. Her desire to see her kids rise to fame blind her from the truth. She denies the drugs and the failures and believes she knows what's best for her kids. This means not letting them get a real chance because it would be with a real manager and she would be left behind. Family is important to her and she wants to keep everyone very close, even if it harms their chance at making a name for themselves. She of course, doesn't realize this. Amy Adams is the love interest, you know there had to be one. She manages to pull Micky away from the family that is dragging him down. They don't like her for it. She has her own inspirations too, yet the story isn't interested in them. The main focus of the film is with Micky's bumpy road to the championship fight. Since this is based on a true story, I can't really fault it for becoming a bit formulaic and predictable, yet it is.<br/><br/>David O. Russell is notorious for getting angry and violent with his crew/cast. He was in a physical fight with George Clooney on the set of Three Kings and anyone can go on youtube and check out the melt down he and Lily Tomlin had on the set of I Heart Huckabees. Both films coincidentally star Mark Walhberg, so it seems he doesn't have a problem working with the combative director. I can't deny that the man has talent. I really love Three Kings and found I Heart Huckabees to be an ambitious project for the sheer weirdness of it all. With The Fighter, he plays to a more conventional audience. In terms of boxing films, it works. It plays on the down and out character, the poverty of his life and the sheer determination he has to make a name for himself. It's no Rocky, or as others have mentioned Raging Bull, but it is good enough to be mentioned with them.<br/><br/>Russell always has an eye for a creative shot. Check out Three Kings colour scheme for what I mean. Here he uses TV cameras for the boxing matches. Interesting move, it feels like we are watching it at home and are not really in the ring with them. I admire directors who think outside of the box. Russell does this, no problem. He also decides to include real footage of the characters. The film has some home video segments throughout and during the credits we get to meet the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eckland, which is even more reason to appreciate Bale's performance.<br/><br/>The film trips a bit because of the lack of emotion from Walhberg. I dig the guy and enjoy his films, but his range isn't there yet. When given a role that he can play the absurdity of, he scores. Watch The Departed for that. For a film where the audience needs to get behind a character, to root and cheer for them to overcome their obstacles, he falls a little short. Thank goodness the film makes up for this with the performances from Bale and Leo.<br/><br/>The Fighter features great music, engaging performances and a predictable, yet true story. I felt attached to the characters and hoping they would make smart decisions. If a film can get me to care about the characters, I say bravo.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a winner in my books."

","Biographies are never easy to make a film of since you can't portray a real person 1:1. Also, you know what you sign up for when you watch a Boxing movie. Personally I'd rather watch a real fight instead of a movie about it since it does look staged no matter what.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg suit the roles decently. But let's be honest, they got the roles because they are big names in the film industry, they are established actors which fit in this pretty well.<br/><br/>
Christian Bale got an Oscar for Supporting Actor in 'The Fighter' and I can kind of see why but am also sceptical. The character 'Dicky', which Bale portrays, in real life isn't your typical guy, he also has a story of drug abuse which had an effect on his personality which you can tell. For me, Christian Bale in this movie was mostly annoying and his character wasn't LEGENDARY or pioneering. Sure it was good acting but I think he himself laughed about his performance or wasn't sure if he was on the right track. When he received the Oscar, on stage he himself was like 'Okay, what am I actually doing up here?'.<br/><br/>
It's a decent movie and you will probably like it if you want to see a Boxing movie really badly, even though there's also a lot of story development around it taking place in about 70% of the movie."

","""The Fighter"" is a fine film about the bond between brothers and the trials they undergo. While the ring may brings its challenges, life hits harder than opponents' gloves ever could.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The struggles that Micky and Dicky face are difficult and honest. The film leaves no choice but to root for them. Director David O. Russell commands strong performances from his cast and brings to the screen a genuine story of brotherhood. *Editing/Cinematography: The world of Micky and Dicky is fast paced and chaotic. The editing accents this very well. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema brings a grounded quality to the film. There is a washed out and chaotic tone to the imagery, mirroring that of the lives of Micky and Dicky. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is authentic and purposeful. Not much more can be said. The acting performances are very strong throughout. Christian Bale takes over the film completely, which pulls attention away from Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg does a decent job, but is overshadowed by Bale. Amy Adams gives a strong supporting performance. *Music/Sound: The music pulls the audience into the world, heightening emotions in many areas. The sound design is fairly average. It does not attract any unneeded attention. *Production Design/Special Effects: The world in which Micky and Dicky live feels very authentic. The film almost feels like a documentary at times. The costumes and sets are highly accurate to what Micky and Dicky experienced in real life. The special effects are good, they accomplish what they intend to, but are not overly impressive. Overall, the world feels real.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""The Fighter"" is a film that is easy to forget after a while, but the performances of Christian Bale and Amy Adams will stay in the back of people's minds."
"andrewroy-04316","7","0","0","19 October 2018"," Great performances and many complex themes and characters make it fun, but a simple ending doesn't give true resolution
","The Fighter is an extremely fun movie to watch, and brings originality to the well-tread rising boxer story. The cast is phenomenal and I think each brings a lot to their performances. Much has been said about Adams, Bale, and Leo's performances, and for good reason - the way each of them pull Micky and are motivated is central to the movie. However, I think Wahlberg's performance is excellent, and in a family where everyone is selfish and aggressively pursuing self-interest, his conflict-averse and subdued nature allow the other characters to shine through, and Wahlberg shows range with his expressions and reactions. The second act is one of my favorites I've ever seen, and if the first and third had fully realized that promise it would be a 10 star movie. The struggles of drug addiction for Dicky were devastating, and Micky's difficult decisions and how his circle shape those decisions was very well done. Leo's performance as a self-centered mother influencing others so she can be tied to success particularly shined through in the second act. The dichotomy between going down with the ship and trusting ""family"" no matter what, as Alice and Dicky demanded, juxtaposed with the external perspective of O'Keefe and Charlene in cutting ties with his troubled family, seemed completely intractable. It was set up brilliantly, but as Micky rose as a fighter, the conflict just seemed to melt away, and the ending, while a triumph, didn't have the emotional intensity that the entire second act did, because it fundamentally ignored the various conflicting forces that made the movie successful. All of the performances are excellent, and the development of the character dynamics, family dynamics, and influences for each person were built up well, but the climax puts all that aside for a mediocre career success for Micky. A very well done movie, but the triumphant ending feels hollow and simple considering the conflicts throughout the movie."

","""Irish"" Mickey Ward (played by Academy Award Nominee Mark Wahlberg) is considered a stepping-stone for those who are on their way to the top in the world light welterweight title. His trainer is his brother (played by Academy Award Winner Christian Bale), his mother is his manager (played by Academy Award Winner Melissa Leo), and his girlfriend is his number one support system (played by Academy Award Nominee Amy Adams). This movie details his million-to-one rise to the top as he goes to show that he is not just a stepping stone. However there are more problems than just his fight; his brother is a drug abuser who hangs out at a crack house, thus pushing Mickey away and leading him to be pulled in two different directions by his family and his girlfriend.<br/><br/>What a great film. Plain and simple. The editing of this film was on pace with the rest of it, and the story - which is based on a true story, btw - is an absolutely astonishing one. I recently reviewed David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which he made after this. Both movies prove that the director is a modern genius. Whether you agree with his tactics or not, you cannot deny that the guy is talented and knows how to get the best of the best from his cast.<br/><br/>And speaking of which, I just got to say that the cast all brings their ""A"" game to this movie. I would like to talk about the supporting characters first, because their characters are just as important as Mickey himself. Amy Adams is brilliant as his no-nonsense girlfriend, while Melissa Leo is great as his no-nonsense mother. While I do believe that they weren't the most deserving people to win Best Supporting Actress that year (that should have gone to Helena Bonham Carter for The King's Speech, imo), both actresses provide their characters with enough of a hard attitude that it's not surprising to see them fighting against each other for Mickey. Yet you can't help but love either one of them; as a result, both actresses at least deserved the nomination. The same can be said for Christian Bale; while I don't think he was the most deserving actor for his category (that award should have gone to Geoffrey Rush for The King's Speech), he gives the most well-rounded performance in the whole entire movie. He is the loser who once had his shot but who is now considered a lost cause. He is considered a pity case. He is a drug addict. And yet, due to the love he has for his family and his brother, you can't help but love him and hope that he defeats his battle against drugs. Bale did not miss a beat; thus he did also deserve a nomination. However, the one actor who did not get an acting nomination was the main man himself, Mark Wahlberg. While he did get nominated for the Best Picture category as a producer on the film, I found it tragic that he wasn't recognized in the lead actor category. He should have been nominated over Javier Bardem's performance in Biutiful; Wahlberg is the guy that you hope gets the shot that he needs for his career. He is amazing in this role and he hits all the right notes.<br/><br/>Finally, I got to pay my respects to Mickey Ward and Dicky Eklund, who both fought very hard battles to get where they are today. While I do not watch boxing, I have nothing but respect for those who fight for what means the most to them. Fighting against drug addiction is hard and so is being considered a stepping-stone. Here's to two men who truly are...THE FIGHTERS.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film! Go and watch it!"

","Not knowing a lot about this movie going in, I expected it to be just another boxing movie that focuses on a complete underdog going from a nobody to a world champion, but I was wrong.<br/><br/>Sure, Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) acquires underdog status somewhere along the way, particularly in the final few fights, but he is much more than that.<br/><br/>I was more than impressed with the performances. The four main leads really brought some of the best work.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg's Mickey Ward was very convincing and I thought his boxing performances were dedicated and sharp. He was more than just a boxer who wanted to be the best. He switched between idealising his brother and realising his flaws while still hoping for redemption.<br/><br/>Christian Bale fully deserved his Oscar for this performance as Dicky Eklund, a local legend and drug addict. The script gives him a lot to work with, but I was more impressed with his depth of facial expression to convey Dicky's emotions. The scene in which Mickey tells him about the deal not to work with him anymore was stellar. I really believed it, down to Bale's performance.<br/><br/>I've always been impressed with Amy Adams in everything she does and her role as bar worker Charlene Fleming was no exception. Charlene is a college dropout (due to partying too hard) who attended on a high jump scholarship. She becomes romantically entangled with Mickey and her fiery personality and grit cause problems with Mickey's family members. Adams plays the part with conviction and precision that comes from a dedicated approach to the role. She really proves herself as one of the greatest in her generation.<br/><br/>Melissa Leo pulls out a wonderful performance as Alice Eklund-Ward, mother to Mickey, Dicky and their sisters. I was impressed with Leo's performance, though less so than her co-stars. In my opinion, the Academy Award belonged to Amy Adams for her performance as Charlene.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes weren't really all that different from other movies, but still exciting and exhilarating. The final fight of the film Ward v Neary left me gripped, unable to look away, my heart pounding as the action took place.<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful movie that proves David O'Russell's talent in directing award-winning performances with a cast that give everything that have to their characters. So I give it a 9/10"

","The Fighter (2010): Dir: David O. Russell / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo, Jack McGee: Mickey Ward has just lost three fights but his family promises bigger things. His half brother Dicky lives off the past glory of knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard but has since resorted to the down slide of crack. These films are common but when done right can be involving. Director David O. Russell previously made such worthy entertainment as Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees. He presents tremendous boxing footage while driving off a film that is mostly formula. As Mickey, Mark Wahlberg is the underdog who looks up to his brother but pulled in several directions when it comes to his career. Christian Bale steals the film as Dicky who often fails to show up to train Mickey due to drugs. After a dispute with police Dicky lands in jail where it is his advice that lands his brother a potential shot at the title. Bale's role is interesting because he must force a compromise when stakes are against him. Amy Adams plays Charlene, a bar waitress whom Mickey's family disapproves of when her advice seems more fitting when he is given an offer to train in Vegas. Melissa Leo plays Alice Ward, his mother who acts as his manager. She becomes violent and demanding when Mickey shifts elsewhere. Jack McGee does a fine job as their father who is more calm natured than his wife. It is somewhat corny that everyone appears at ringside to show mutual support but the message is strong in its parallel of family and career and what is worth fighting for. Score: 8 / 10"

","I must first make a confession: I really don't like sports movies. However, I make exceptions for boxing movies because it's more action than sports (and let's not forget the incredible pedigree of boxing movies from Rocky to Million Dollar Baby). Nonetheless, this movie does not fail to hit hard both in the drama and the boxing department. I found myself very emotionally tied to the boxing and to the family/romantic drama contained within. That is to say that both the suspense of the fights and the development of the characters is superb. In short, this movie is well written.<br/><br/>Mr. Bale and Mr. Wahlberg also give stunning performances. It is certain that Mr. Bale deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor (if anything for loosing all of the weight he did for the role!). I would add however, that sometimes Mr. Bale's character overshadowed the main character of Mr. Wahlberg. <br/><br/>As a final note, technically speaking, I felt that the cinematography was good and for the most part appropriate, but sometimes distracting and a bit to creative for a boxing movie. That may be more of a personal preference, but there you have it. <br/><br/>So definitely check this movie out, especially if you are into an excellent drama, romance, boxing flick!"

","This is my second biopic in the last few days and even though I thought 42 was a great film I think the fighter is a more complete film and I think this film is fantastic. The film focuses on boxer Mickey ward who is down on his luck and not going anywhere in his boxing career. He is also being held down by his family especially his crack head trainer his brother dicky. Now Mark wahlberg is a decent actor and he does a really good job here, he carries the emotional scenes and I fully believed him as this boxer that just needs the confidence to succeed in life. But show stealer and game changer is Christian bale as dicky in a role that he won an Oscar for. Bale is such a good actor and he fully commits to this role you truly do believe he is this crack head who is messed up in the head. But also I like damaged characters who underneath have a good side to them and Christian bale nailed that part in this film to flawless levels. Amy Adams is really good in this film also, she plays mickeys girlfriend and she wasn't just this girl to look at, she was strong, determined and you see her reasoning for her actions in this film. Melissa Leo is also really good in the film she was an antagonist in the film but she brought allot of sympathy to her character and allot of complex things to her that makes you even kind of like her by the end of the film. The story is great, yes when it comes to the boxing you have seen it all before but it's good stuff and more importantly this film is not about boxing really it is about a relationship between two brothers and a family that is fractured and in that way it succeeds. There are allot of emotional scenes in this movie and they do hit you because of the performances and the story of this film is what makes it so interesting to watch. The script is the only part of the film that is lacking a little bit. The drama is done well and the small bits of humour as well, its just that sometimes it becomes hard to understand people and there are some shouting matches that really don't add anything to the film. The style is really good with it portraying a realistic world that these people live in making you care about them because all of this is the real world. Also all of the boxing scenes were filmed well which is a good thing in your boxing movie. Overall this is a fantastic film where if you can take the drama is definitely worth the watch."

","This true story about light welterweight boxer and Micky Ward makes for less of a sports movie than a domestic drama about blue-collar brothers struggling to stay a family while the forces of drug addiction and parental ambition tear them apart.But there is something a little too cartoonish about Micky's completely impossible family and also something a little too short-sighted in a protagonist who can't see the obvious — that his family, and not other fighters, is what stands in his way as a boxer.Until he catch a girlfriend Charlene played by Amy Adam.She is the only one who pushes him to stand up to his family.And it soon is clear enough that Charlene is the only character in the film who is not delusional and with her eyes like blue steel and swarm of red hair it's very easy to like it.It's not clear in the movie why Micky never spots any of this dysfunction.He wants to live up to an image Dickie put in his mind when he was a kid, an impression so strong that he doesn't realize that it disintegrated long ago.The movie greats very good drama and very good atmosphere but i kind of didn't like so much the boxing matches and the end The boxing sequences get bunched toward the end. The Director deliberately shoots them in brightly lit video that makes it look like you're watching television. He has broadcasters and ringsiders comment on the fights, but seldom takes you close enough to hear what Dickie might be saying to Micky. You're outside the ring, not inside. So like much of this film, the viewer is turned into an observer. You never feel close enough to the action, either in the ring or in the kitchens, living rooms and tough streets where the story takes place. The characters engage you up to a point but never really pull you in."
"brchthethird","7","0","0","6 February 2015"," Conventional, but effective - a perfect match of performers with material
","While it certainly isn't too original in it's approach to the material, THE FIGHTER is a technically proficient film with knock-out performances by Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Based on true events, Mark Wahlberg plays ""Irish"" Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts who has a great aspirations but little so far to show for them. Christian Bale plays his brother, Dicky Eklund, also a (former) boxer, who trained him. He also happened to be addicted to crack and had numerous run-ins with the law. Even though the film had some great, intense boxing sequences, what really stood out to me was the dramatic aspect of it. The central conflict is drawn between Micky and his family who manage him and support him, yet somehow might be holding him back. The backlash that comes after he decides to start working with other people in order to get ahead felt very real, if a little melodramatic at times. Amy Adams also has a really great role as Charlene, Micky's girlfriend. But the clear standout of the cast is Christian Bale, who puts everything into his portrayal of Micky's wayward older brother Dicky. While Micky is most likely the ""fighter"" of the title, Dicky is no less a fighter himself who hits bottom and fights his way back from addiction. One scene in particular was really eye-opening, as Dicky is in prison and watching an HBO documentary about him (or at least he thinks it is). Once he finds out what the documentary is actually about, he makes a change in himself that has implications for the rest of the film. When all is said and done, this was the kind of sports movie that I like: the one that isn't just about sports. At its core is a family drama about two brothers that really hits home on an emotional level, even if it sticks to convention. I'd kind of like to think of this as David O. Russell's RAGING BULL. Overall, if you like a good sports drama or boxing movie, you can't go wrong with this one."

This movie is by turns funny, heartbreaking, and ultimately inspiring. And it's all the more powerful for being true. Some of the things in here, you just can't make up.<br/><br/>The story follows brothers Mickey Ward and Nicky Eklund of Lowell Massachusetts. Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) is thirty, and struggling to establish himself as a serious boxer. Older brother Nicky (Christian Bale) had his brush with greatness, but never made the big time because of his crack habit. Now he trains his brother, while their overbearing mom, Alice (Melissa Leo) manages. Mickey's brother and mother only want the best for him, but between Mickey's addiction and unreliability and Alice's tendency to push him into fights he's not ready for, they're as much a hindrance as a help. For Mickey to make it to the top he'll have to step out of family's shadow, and for Nicky to really help his brother, he'll have to break his old habits.<br/><br/>Walberg is excellent as Mickey. Physically, he's in great shape, looking every bit the contender. And on an emotional level, he nails the part of a man who's tired of being an also ran, of letting his friends and neighbors down. His earnestness and his desire to come out from his brother's shadow are palpable. Amy Adams also puts in good work as Mickey's girlfriend Charlene. Along with his father George, she's the voice of reason in opposition to the craziness of his mother and sisters, the one pushes him to do the smart thing instead of going back to the way things were.<br/><br/>But the greatest performance by far is Bale's, as Nicky. His is one of the best portrayals of addiction since Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend. But where drink had prevented Milland's character from ever achieving anything worthwhile, Nicky has taken an even greater fall. He used to be a contender; he fought Sugar Ray Leonard for goodness sake! But now he's a slacker, a goof off, showing up late for training sessions, missing work, and jumping out of second story windows into dumpsters so his mom doesn't catch him at the local crack house.<br/><br/>And whereas The Lost Weekend was a tale of sorrow upon sorrow that attracted only sympathy for its protagonist, Bale is far more nuanced as Nicky. He's pathetic sure, but just like that one stoner friend you had in high school, he can also be pretty funny. His obliviousness and goofy, in-your-face mannerisms are worth more than a few chuckles, and his plan for raising some quick cash results in one of funniest sequences I've seen outside of a comedy. That's not to say there's anything lightweight about his performance. When he and his family see the ESPN documentary on crack addiction, the one they thought was about his 'comeback' it is absolutely shattering, both for him and for us.<br/><br/>The documentary, the filming of which runs through first half, is an excellent plot device. Besides providing emotional depth, it gives us a greater sense of what Nicky used to be, and acts as a catalyst for the development of the second half. But this movie isn't just about drugs and family issues; it's about boxing. Not to worry, the fight scenes are first rate. It feels like your right in the ring with them. And you will be rooting for Mickey every step of the way. As I watched him coming back against Sanchez, and in his title bout, I was pumping my fists and shouting encouragements under my breath. And looking around the theatre, I wasn't the only one.<br/><br/>The fighter is an excellent sports movie, and a true gem of independent filmmaking. It works on the levels of both serious relationship movie and feel good sports flick. It's about believing in yourself, becoming your own man, and overcoming dependency, whether to drugs, old habits, or even your own family."

","Many sports films revolve around boxing and the challenges the leading actor faces. David O Russell's ""The Fighter"" is a powerful boxing film that develops all its fighting characters and gives a strong message about persistence. Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, the real-life mid 1980's boxer from the streets of Boston who worked his way to earn special titles in the boxing world. Wahlberg really isn't the lead character focused on. Christian Bale gives an exhilarating performance as Micky's brother Dicky. Bale nails the Boston accent and plays a dirty and somewhat dirt-bag of a character. Dicky is a drug addict who used to be a former boxer and is famous for beating a world-class boxer, even though he wasn't the cause of the defeat. Dicky trains Micky to win everything, but the two brothers have strong arguments and aggressive crisis' they have to face. Amy Adams plays Charlene, Micky's lover. Charlene is a supportive girlfriend who needs to be aggressive with Micky's dysfunctional family. The head of that family is Dicky and Micky's mother, Alice. She's a tough Boston mom who has always aggressively supported her boys. Both ladies give great performances due to their perfect accents and exert strong emotions. This film refers to every character who fights throughout the story. David O.Russell doesn't just direct another ""Rocky"" with an f-bomb filled script in order to entertain the audience. He strives to inspire us. This film shows the dynamics of a family who are affected by one member trying to fulfill a dream and how teamwork, love and support can help achieve a goal. David O.Russell does a typical boxing film on the outline, but makes it extraordinarily unique due to what the film focuses on. This film should never be referred to as a boxing film, but rather a family film that revolves around boxing. Brilliant acting, superb script and perfect directing by David O.Russell. This film portrays the family life these people had beautifully, and shows the setting, lifestyle and dreams of persistent people come to life. Truly inspiring!"

","The Fighter starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale is a film about two brothers in Lowell, Massachusetts. The film is based on the true lives of Dicky Eklund (Bale) and Micky Ward (Wahlberg), both professional boxers. Dicky was once one of the best boxers in the industry, and became well known for knocking down heavy weight Sugar Ray Leonard in a 1978 boxing match. After his glory faded Dicky became addicted to crack and somewhat of a joke around Lowell. His younger brother, Micky, is still actively trying to make a name for himself in the boxing world and Dicky is his trainer. Alice Ward is their overbearing mother, and also Micky's manager. She is very controlling of Micky's career early on and makes some questionable decisions about Micky's fights and his future in boxing. As a result of his brother missing workouts, and his mother booking inappropriate fights for him, Micky finds new management and starts training with the local police officer, O' Keefe. Micky has his new manager, trainer, and girlfriend Charlene, played by Amy Adams, in his corner winning several fights, but he truly wants his family to be a part of his journey. <br/><br/>The theme is this film is to have heart in everything you do. Micky goes through so many hard times leading up to his win at WBU Heavyweight Championship. He has to deal with not being able to care for his daughter Kasie like he wants, his mother and seven sisters being so irrational, his brother's addiction and stint in prison; he had to make the difficult decision to cut his family out of his life for a period of time so that he could focus on boxing and getting his confidence built. In every challenging situation he faced, he made decisions with heart, he thought about his own well-being, but also his family's and Charlene's. The theme in this film can speak to anyone who has had to work incredibly hard at something to achieve their goal. <br/><br/>The camera angle throughout this film is an important aspect. Several scenes have many people in them and most of the characters are talking all at once, but where the camera is looking gives you the indication that you need to focus your attention on something or someone. Also the dialogue is so fast paced in most of the scenes that the camera switching back and forth to each person is very important, and I think was done very well in this film. During any of the boxing scenes it is important to see the action and the reaction of each punch through the camera angle and editing. The scenes when Dicky is high on crack the switching back and forth of scenes in his head and the confusing muddled sounds playing over them makes you feel like you're in his mind with him, going through whatever he is at the time. <br/><br/>The Fighter has a lot of great elements; the editing, the acting, and the overall theme. Watching a film that focuses on the trials and tribulations you must go through to achieve your goal is heartwarming and entertaining."

","Boxing movies are one of the few sports that seem to have a genre that works on screen. It's one on one there's drama, and it can all change in a split second, so suits the medium. Most of the films are poor but entertaining, but there have been a few gems which includes the majestic 'Raging Bull'.<br/><br/>This isn't 'Ranging Bull' but we have here a biopic on the rise of an American blue collar boxer called Micky Ward. He is hampered in his rise by this dysfunctional family which has a stranglehold on his career. A dominant matriarch who is out of her depth in managing his career, a half-brother who is a former boxer and now his trainer but is addicted to crack and so on. Seems like there is no hope but there is.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the family action is what really creates this movie. None of the over sentimental drivel you get in other movies but you will have a good overview of the life of this family that lives off of Micky Ward, and seems to be flogging him in the cruel world of boxing. They love and want what's best for him but aren't the best equipped, eschewing outside help.<br/><br/>Micky's battle is to make change for his career and for the best of his family.<br/><br/>With this kind of film, it's the acting that matters, and the 3-4 main leads are exceptionally good. Wahlberg is quietly effective but strong as Mickey, Bale & Leo are excellent as the half-brother and mother respectively, whilst Amy Adams as the girlfriend is very effective.<br/><br/>However, one problem is that to condense the story & life into this film, the director seems to have sadly relied on caricature for many characters (even some of the leads) and this devalues the film which is a shame. The film can be quite demeaning to blue-collar working people, but I don't think that was its intention. They should have revised parts of the script I think.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes are very good too without needing to resort to being Rocky. They're fine and exciting.<br/><br/>This is an intelligent move, and enjoyable. There have been far better. Some may find aspects uncomfortable, but as a sports movie it is very good. Despite some heavy themes, it is a feel good movie for adults and you will feel great after watching this."

","It's hard to say which one of the two leads deserve the most praise and that's just one of the great things you can credit this magnificent film for.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg has firmly left his Marky Mark days behind him and has been in some of the most praised American films of the 90s and 00s. and he is no dummy. He knows he will look good if he is surrounded by top- notch talent, even if it means being overshadowed by them.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that I couldn't find one bad performance in The Fighter, even down to the smallest parts. The whole thing seemed totally authentic and credit therefore must go not only to Bale and Wahlberg but certainly in no small way to David O. Russell.<br/><br/>But we must remember that this is especially Bale's show. His performance cannot be diminished. It is an extremely scary and sad character but we totally believe his transformation. It is also a little frightening to think that he actually looks not at all well through the entire thing. He must have starved himself to slim down to that stick figure.<br/><br/>The one thing I couldn't really understand was the fight scenes. How come Wahlberg's fighter can take numerous extremely hard blows to the head without much damage? It hardly looks like he's been hit, except for the first fight. But I'll let that one slide.<br/><br/>Otherwise, kudos all around. Extremely well crafted, superb underdog story and what about that Amy Adams. She will definitely bring in all the boys. She is not a bad actress either."

","I thought this was a fairly good film but I found it lacked anything to really differentiate it form so many film that are so similar to it. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it as a film, but still I found it didn't offer anything extra or anything else to make it a little more exciting.<br/><br/>To start with I found the whole story fairly dull, there were no real high points and found that even the dramatic ending which was a truly spectacular achievement was underplayed which was particularly odd, especially for a fighting film. Far too much emphasis was also put on the mother and sisters which kind of became tedious after just a small pat of the film, as they were fairly irrelevant as there were simply too many of them there all at once.<br/><br/>However I really did think that the way the fights was shown was original, using a TV style of shots was nice to give the film a sense of realism, as well as the montage of fights in the middle of the film which had smooth transitions and didn't over emphasise everything. In this film I felt some of the acting was really energetic Christian Bale being the first actor that comes to mind, as he really to show the crazy drug induced brother well, I felt that Amy Adams was also a welcome edition to the cast although I also felt she kind of lost her determination as a character towards the end, that be said she was still a pleasure to watch. <br/><br/>My biggest disappointment for this film was Mark Wahlberg who I found to be completely emotionless the whole film, which is sad as usually he shows more passion for a role but he really was quite wooden in his acting, but I get the feeling he was told to this rather than that being his own interpretation, but this did allow Bale and Adams to really steal the show, so to speak.<br/><br/>All in all I liked this film but felt it was really let down in how it was shown, which was a shame as there were some great acting performances in there. Worth a watch but it can be a little dull at times, particularly with the family problems."
"jafar-iqbal","8","0","0","27 September 2012"," Two fantastic performances at the heart of a good film.
","Art imitates life in more ways than one in 'The Fighter'. As those who have seen it know, it's based on the true story of Boston-born boxers Mickey and Dickie Ward. We even see their real-life counterparts in the film. But it's quite interesting that the two lead actors are quite similar to their boxing equivalents. Bale is accomplished, experienced, the man who has it all. Unlike Dickie, though, Bale hasn't thrown it all away; and if he keeps giving electric performances like this one, he probably won't.<br/><br/>And like Mickey Ward, Wahlberg is a once under-appreciated actor who has slowly started to prove his doubters (including me) wrong. With this, he shows once again that he can be versatile. I don't think he is as good as Bale in this, but that's probably because Bale's character is just so extravagant. Both men, though, are brilliant. And the Oscar nods were greatly deserved.<br/><br/>The film never stops being boring – the two hour run-time flies by. There's ample support from the likes of Melissa Leo and Amy Adams, all playing integral roles in the story. The star of the show is Christian Bale though. He's a far cry from the Bruce Wayne we saw earlier this year; it's a thin and scraggly Bale, getting into the heart of the character as he always does brilliantly.<br/><br/>A great movie."

","Acting. That's the movies stand out point. Brilliant acting. Not just because of the Oscars, but really you have to see it for yourself. The story that is centered on a boxer from Lowell, MS, comes of as a pretty standard boxing story (with a few twists), even though it's based on a true story. It's a drama to the fullest sense of the word, but not uninteresting one. <br/><br/>The story develops just the way it should, even though it has a few loose ends. The movie is written well and the boxing scenes are, more or less, well made. Well made meaning they look realistic. Two main actresses have put in wonderful performances, and Mark Wahlberg also puts in a solid performance (you cannot not like his character), but unfortunately (or fortunately) they are all outplayed by Christian Bale. Bale's Oscar-winning portrayal of a former boxer who lives in the past, and is also a crack addict, is pure genius. Just for the sake of his acting you should watch this movie.<br/><br/>The movie flows very well, it's never boring, it has just about the right amount of boxing scenes vs. everyday life scenes, it has brilliant acting, and a few shocking, tear-inducing scenes, which are more than welcome in this kind of movie. A warm recommendation to everyone, even to the uninterested kind, based solely on acting if not on everything else."

","The main actors really put out their best work in this film. It seemed that Mark Whalberg, the actor he is, took the back seat in this film. His part wasn't weak, it is the others really stepped up in their performance level.<br/><br/>Christian Bale seems to translate into a complete metamorphosis, to play the drug addict brother to the protagonist in the film. His part in no way had any flaws; probably one of his top performances ever.<br/><br/>The mother, played by Melissa Leo, also a great performance. Though she is in real life, only 11-14 years older than the actors playing her sons in the movie, she pulls it off; again flawlessly.<br/><br/>The others, including Amy Adams, really have it together in this story. The cast ensemble are really good.<br/><br/>Though this movie might have a ""feel"" of a Clint Eastwood production, it in no way resembles 'Million Dollar Baby'. This movie is based on a true story, each of the main characters having their own life struggles, having to need the others support to make their mark in life. Each of these main characters struggle for their significance that is part of the mark in their life.<br/><br/>Though this movie is probably classified as a ""sports"" or ""boxing"" movie, the actual sport has little to do with the fabric of the overall structure of the story. It is a story of underdogs coming from the ruins of their particular neighborhood, working hard to get to where they could be on top or within reach of it.

","I think when the titular lead in the Coen brothers' 1991 film Barton Fink was repeatedly asked to pen a ""wrestling movie"", this is the sort of film that rich; mansion owning; pool-side dwelling studio executive was asking him to write. The Fighter has just about everything along those lines, the sort of film that builds to a 'big fight'; follows a plucky underdog who comes good; that has a delicate romance sewn up in amidst proceedings and enjoys its scenes in which volatile friends and family members bicker and clash with our lead over his decisions as he finally gets the chance to get along by himself in life. Unlike our old friend Fink, the makers of The Fighter are not stifled by the material, nor do they struggle with inserting real drive into proceedings. In fact, they tear into all of the frameworks; genre demands and character arcs with such aplomb, that it's difficult not to offer a meek smile and a brief internal cheer when a certain latter-part of the film fight has just ended and the result is what it is, despite knowing that the sorts of people we're rooting on are what they are on account of spending the last hour and a half with them.<br/><br/>The lead is Mark Wahlberg's Mickey Ward, the little brother to a rather renowned Irish-American boxer named Dicky, played by Christian Bale, operating out of the American city of Lowell, in Massachusetts. A part time road sweep who boxes a little himself, Mickey lives in the shadow of his elder brother whose record is admirable and whose real claim to fame was that he knocked down a certain ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard in a particular fight before going on to lose – a sort of 'Henry Cooper knocking down Cassius Clay' moment wherein people think of the actual result second to a specific moment in the contest. Dicky and Mickey occupy the frame together when we first see them, an odd moment in which a real-life 1990s made for TV documentary about drug addiction is being brought to life, fictitiously, with Bale and Wahlberg filling in for their counterparts. Dicky is the talkative one, a man who usually need only saunter down a street in the general area to be recognised and congratulated by the locals; Mickey cannot get a word in, but is talked up as the ""next big thing"" in boxing.<br/><br/>The fight against Leonard is a big deal to these people; if there is anything at all they can remember in-between their crack habits and low-level criminal activity, then it is how to speak the English language; what it is their names are and that moment in 1976 when Dicky took a swing in front of a packed Boston crowd only to floor the rather more famous ""Sugar"" Ray. When the pair of them bump into one another at a boxing match some time later, we observe the respective entourages either men possess; Dicky speaks as if Leonard were on a similar wavelength to that of him anyway, as if Leonard has been brooding and revelling in such a moment from however many number of years ago similarly to how Dicky has been all this time. It isn't long before we're zeroing in on Mickey, though; at a bar late at night wherein leering and laughing and joking in that loud and obnoxious manner that's often apparent in dives such as the one depicted, we observe Mickey's physical distancing from the crowds and his more gentlemanly approach to the bar girl, Amy Adams' Charlene, when all that preceded it was filth.<br/><br/>Around this distinction unfolds a part of Mickey's own boxing career; his relationship with Charlene and the class war with his half a dozen sisters-plus-volatile mother which is instigated as a result of this. First and foremost, the film is about someone veering away from foundations which only appear sturdy and into realms that are new and somewhat frightening but are independent and will be successful with hard graft. The scenes Mickey spends with Charlene are fun and feel different, her practising of an old hobby-come-sport of her own in high jumping whilst outside in a leisurely manner in stark contrast to the flesh and blood in Dicky attempting to scam bystanders into providing him with cash to feed his own drug habit. In moving away from the parental ties Mickey has, and away from the drug-problem riddled brother, we sense the author's message in depicting Mickey's success story away from these things.<br/><br/>The film is executed in an engaging fashion, in spite of its relatively formulaic foundations; the director, a certain David O. Russell, keeps everything moving in the brisk manner he did with his Kelly's Heroes simulacrum in 1999's Three Kings, whilst providing us with a film so apt in journeyman-like qualities that the only real criticisms are limited to it being culpable to accusations of formula. Away from the training montages, of which are a beat from the overture ringing out during Rocky II's training montage away from self-parody, and away from the frantic searches for the likes of new sponsors and trainers when Dicky falls foul of the law, the film possesses some fantastic acting performances depicting pent up people in a hostile place continually expressing themselves, and is an involving drama which is easy to sneer at but difficult not to get wrapped up in."

","On the Merriam-Webster website, the word ""dysfunction"" is defined as ""an abnormal or unhealthy interpersonal behavior or interaction within a group"" (M-W.com, 2011). In The Fighter (Russell, 2010), Micky Ward is a boxer who is a long way from being the fighter that his crack addicted half-brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) used to be. Micky places complete trust in his boxing career with Dicky and their mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). As his career stagnates under the direction of his two family members, Micky meets Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a barmaid who wants to escape the life she is in. As Micky and Charlene's relationship progresses, Charlene is able to have Micky see that Dicky and Alice's control extends past the ring and into his life. Separating his career from his family allows Micky to become the fighter that he wants to be and eventually the champion that Dicky could never be.<br/><br/>Boxing movies usually have the same universal theme which is overcoming obstacles to reach or stay on top. The first installment of Rocky (Avildsen, 1976), is the story of Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) overcoming his obstacles and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) to win the title. In Rocky, the climactic scene is Rocky fighting Apollo to win the title. In The Fighter, Micky Ward is a fighter similar to Rocky. The fight scenes are long and Micky absorbs a lot of shots. The subjective shots in The Fighter have the viewer in the ring with Micky, absorbing the punches that Micky takes. Much like Rocky, Micky usually finds a way to win in the later rounds over an opponent that is bigger and stronger than Micky. In The Fighter, Micky becomes a champion in the ring by taking control of his career and his life. <br/><br/>There are many fights that Micky has to win. Micky has to overcome his domineering mother, Dicky's demons, and the chorus of sisters that make up his dysfunctional family. With Charlene, Micky realizes that divesting himself of his family's dysfunctions allows him to grow as a boxer and a person. The dialogue between Charlene and the family are tense and confrontational with Micky being caught in the middle. The sequence of scenes in prison between Dicky and Micky shows Micky breaking free of Dicky's shadow and becoming his own person. Micky's sisters add to the dysfunction that Micky has to deal with by not accepting Charlene. As Micky rises to the top, he is able to define his family's role in his life.

","Since several friends of mine have recommended this movie, and since one of them even lent me the DVD, I thought I'd better give it a look. Well, it makes a nice change to say they were correct on this occasion, it's a tremendous film! I really enjoyed it and have no problem in recommending it (yes, I liked it that much I'll recommend it in the first paragraph). I'll tell you why after this brief summary.<br/><br/>Micky Ward is a boxer, not a very successful one when we meet him, but a boxer nonetheless. His half-brother, Dicky Eklund, on the other hand, once had a fight for the world title against Sugar Ray Leonard. As we begin, Dicky is supposed to be training Micky, but he's late he's always late. A film crew are making a documentary about Dicky, a documentary about the effects of crack addiction. Yes, Dicky has a habit and yet none of his family is prepared to do anything about it. His mother, Alice, who runs the family with an iron fist, refuses to recognise it, as does her husband, George Ward and his many sisters (too many to mention). Micky meets a girl, Charlene Fleming and they start to see each other, she is strong-willed, just like his mother, and you can see conflict coming. When Dicky gets locked up Charlene persuades Micky to go with a different manager and trainer. It pays off and Micky gets on the road to success but how will his family react? I'll leave it there because I don't want the Spoiler Police breaking my fingers.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is a great family drama, and what makes it better is that it's based on a true story. The critics were all over Christian Bale's performance and he did indeed walk away with the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund. Also worthy of note was Melissa Leo who also won the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her take on the domineering mother, Alice Ward. Personally, I was surprised that Mark Wahlberg didn't even get a nomination for his role of Micky Ward and I have to also give a mention to Amy Adams as Charlene Fleming, who I thought was also great.<br/><br/>I find that sometimes films based on true stories tend to over-dramatise events and in doing so lose the essence of the story. I don't think that is true in this case, they are very much 'larger than life' characters and that's just how they are portrayed. I did find it ironic though that 'Irish' Micky Ward had to fight an Irishman for one of his big fights. I noticed the filmmakers made him a not very nice Irishman though. But enough of that, I found the film very uplifting and quite inspiring. As I said at the beginning, I have no problem in recommending this one If you haven't seen it, please do, it's well worth the time.<br/><br/>My Score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 77,231 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 225 reviews counted at the time of going to press)."

","Mark Whalberg and Christian Bale both give exceptional performances as half-brother boxers Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. Micky is a down-and-out fighter who's become a stepping stone for other fighter's careers; the fact that Dicky (also his trainer) is addicted to cocaine and that his mother-turned-manager (Melissa Leo) only seems interested in promoting Dicky doesn't help matters. Obvious mismanagement, his brother's incarceration and police brutality (they broke Micky's hand when they realized that he was a boxer) causes friction between Micky and his exceptionally large family. Eventually his girlfriend (Amy Adams) convinces him to change managers, which puts him back on an unprecedented winning- streak, leading to a title shot.<br/><br/>Important to note is that this film isn't solely about Micky's inspirational comeback (which it very easily could have been). It's about family - Micky, Dicky and their mother. The film brilliantly balances screen-time between the three characters (the two brothers in particular), adding a level of insight and dramatic depth that would never have been possible otherwise (neither Micky nor Dicky would have been nearly as interesting on their own).<br/><br/>Like every boxing drama since ""Rocky"" (1976), this incredibly well-conceived, well-executed film fails only in one respect: it doesn't compare favorably to its antecedent. The boxing scenes, while they're themselves riveting, don't near ""Rocky""'s level until the end of the movie. Charlene (Amy Adams), however, is both better developed and better acted than the sub- standard Adrianne.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is easily the best boxing movie of its decade (better even than the notable ""Cinderella Man"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"") and the best one since ""Raging Bull"" (1980). Fans of Sports Dramas (boxing in particular) or of any of the four chief actors (Whalberg, Bale, Leo, Adams) will find plenty to enjoy."

I have seen a documentary about Dicky Eklund so I can say that Bale overacted and didn't really resemble the man at all. This isn't really a criticism because no actor has ever got it right. It's just impossible for someone to play someone else. It has the trappings of all biopics that they have to include standard movie clichés throughout. This will be the last time I watch a movie based on a real person. The real life drama is far more interesting to me. I guess it's an OK boxing movie on it's own. But you can't recreate the true drama of real life. No man can replicate another's sole. Dicky Eklund was in a HBO documentary called High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell if anyone's interested. This is far more insightful. If you enjoy movies based on someones life then this is about as good as it gets. It's just not for me."

","Boxing movies can be formula and unpleasant and this is no exception. It was very ho hum except for the fight at the end. Predictable story and not very interesting choice between sticking with his brother and going with his girlfriend's advice. Who cares. Plus points: Christian Bale is a versatile actor and he does act quite drugged out. He is quite a scene stealer but in the end who cares about his troubles. Minus points: Didn't like the jerky camera style. Amy Adams (the main reason I watched this movie) is a good actress but she was kind of miscast here. She plays against type and doesn't quite make it. Too sweet and classy still. Melissa Leo is okay but the performance isn't really that fantastic. Why does doing a good white trash imitation give the right to a nomination? Marky Mark is adequate but his story isn't worth telling. The people are uninteresting and unpleasant. The dialog uses expletives to add drama. If you missed this one you didn't miss anything. Don't bother unless you are a boxing fan. Just a step better than that depressing nightmare of a Million Dollar Baby."

","The story of Micky Ward, the Lowell, Massachusetts boxing underdog who fought his way to the top of the game was destined to be a movie. The Fighter features larger-than-life characters, a love story, and some truly rousing fight scenes, and yet it's missing something. Micky himself, played here with quiet dignity by Mark Whalberg, just isn't an engaging enough character for us to get behind fully. However, there's enough grade-A acting and swift pacing to make up for that. The Fighter was directed by the controversial but acclaimed David O. Russell, known for films such as Spanking the Monkey and Three Kings. His direction here is straightforward, but artful. Read my full review at: http://bit.ly/nzVwGz"

","Finally I have time to watch this Oscar-winning film, twice in a row. It is a solid and caring theatrical work, a superbly contrived and deftly orchestrated sport-drama to be reckoned among its boxing sub-genre magnum opuses such as ROCKY (1976), RAGING BULL (1980), MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), and it belongs to this new decade. <br/><br/>The pseudo-fly-on-the-wall boxing scenes in the film is remarkable both visually and mentally, even though boxing/sports films never fall into my radar range. Bloody yes, but on account of its biographic attribute, the zenith here is definitely not about boxing, the familial conflict is the remedy which we are longing for. <br/><br/>Guiding us through this dramatic mental adventure is director David O. Russell's virtuoso prowess, whose filmography includes I HEART HUCKABEES (2004) and THREE KINGS (1999), both stars Mark Wahlberg. Russell's excellence could be easily detected through the dexterous shots, the terrific milieu setting and the intensifying tensions among his actors, also the retro soundtrack has an irresistible enthrallment on me. <br/><br/>Anyhow, two Oscars for Christian Bale and Melissa Leo resolutely evince that it is an actors' film, but in the case of Christian and Melissa, their versatilities are no big surprises here for their trademarks as the drug-addict brother (stop torturing your body, Mr. Bale, that's enough, it's only a job!) that and the tough-as-nails yet solicitous mother. The bona fide revelation is Amy Adams, whose previous screen image had been pigeonholed as an innocuous and adorable sweetheart (as in JULIE & JULIA 2009, ENCHANTED 2007, as well as her other Oscar- nominated roles in DOUBT 2008 and JUNEBUG 2005), in THE FIGHTER, Amy demonstrates her resilient magnetism to impress everyone to incarnate herself as another true fighter, 3 Oscar nominations in 5 years, which is a quite astonishing achievement, so as to say, a late bloom never come too late, even for a career as ruthless as actress. Let's not forget our protagonist, the actor/producer Mark Wahlberg, who clearly embarks on a more profitable occupation as a producer meanwhile his acting in the film is by comparison sheerly overshadowed by his co- stars, although I cannot deny that he had been working hard for his role, and to play a blooming boxer at the age of 39 is courageous.<br/><br/>So, it's ambivalent and useless to guess who is the real fighter in this film (maybe a rename to THE FIGHTERS are more soothing), in reality, we are all fighters to endure and survive in the mundane world (thanks god I don't have 7 sisters for the sake of the poor parenthood)."

","As our leading man's manipulative, self-centered blood relatives, Christian Bale and Melissa Leo clearly relish their chance to play such deep, dark, multidimensional roles. Beneath the dark cloud of bitter dreams and selfishness that surrounds both, it's easy to tell they see more than just a meal ticket in poor Micky's climb through the ranks, though both certainly enjoy the perks of that association. This film is really at its best when teetering on the brink of two extremes: loyalty and family bonds tugging in one direction, while self-preservation and a devoted love interest pull in the other. When it becomes clear that a resolution to this conflict isn't forthcoming prior to the finale, a lot of the air goes out of the story. Interesting filming techniques add a small bonus to the experience, with drastically different textures setting the mood for documentary scenes, moments of family drama and fight nights, respectively. A solid flick, though not one I'd have expected to get a Best Picture nod."

","This movie is based on a true story where the viewer sees the dynamics of a family which lives and breathes for boxing and for the two brothers who carry their hopes. The two brothers, Dickie and Mickey Ward of Lowell, Massachusetts, are performed by Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. Christian Bale as Dickie Ward is the older brother who is unable to focus his tremendous energy and this leads to crack addiction, uncontrolled behavior and time in prison. Mickey Ward is the younger brother who wants a better life and has the self-discipline to make it happen. He breaks off from his brother and mentor and when the older brother returns from prison, he is unwilling to rehire him as his coach. His mother (Melissa Leo) and sisters fly into a rage, taking the older brother's side against Mickey and his girlfriend, played by Amy Adams. Mickey, out of family loyalty, takes his brother back as coach to prepare for a fight for the world welterweight championship. Mickey is a human punching bag and a glutton for punishment but smart enough to keep his hands up and to know that if he wears the other guy down, he can land the killer punch. There are several farcical scenes in this family's war with one another. The cast is outstanding and the boxing scenes make us feel like we have ringside seats. A fine boxing movie with human drama, I like this movie and would gladly watch it again.               "

Don't get me wrong I am in no way a boxing fan but i thought a movie that is based on a true story of a boxer should have a bit more boxing development in it. Though it is mainly about him and his familys drama. This is the reason for no perfect score.<br/><br/>This movie is very well done however with amazing performances from the cast, a very powerful script and solid directing I was very impressed. Also it is based on a true story which everybody knows makes any movie better. Go watch this movie now friends"

","On paper this movie looks just like every other boxing movie churned out by Hollywood in the last eighty years or so: a boxer rated by nobody overcomes the odds to have a crack at a title fight and win the respect of his peers. What sets this one apart is the fact that the boxing itself takes a back seat for the most part while the story concentrates on the interplay between the key members of real-life boxer Micky Ward's mightily dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg as Ward is the leading man, but in reality it's Christian Bale's picture. He plays Dicky, the crack-addicted older brother of Micky who once shared the ring with Sugar Ray Leonard (who makes a cameo appearance) and even put him on the canvas (or did he?). Bale, who lost a huge amount of weight and closely studied the real-life Dicky, inhabits the role so completely that he commands your attention when he's on the screen, and when he isn't leaves you wondering when he's going to come back .<br/><br/>The film was made with the full co-operation of Ward and his family, so it's quite surprising that the film pulls no punches when showing all their quirks and shortcomings. They're a boozy lot, ruled over by a domineering, tarty mother (Melissa Leo) who leads her long-suffering husband a miserable dance and rules with the sharpest of tongues a gaggle of homely daughters who seem to do nothing other than sit in hypocritical judgment of anyone unfortunate enough to cross their path. In the midst of all this, Wahlberg looks kind of lost, and is largely called upon simply to respond to the chaos that surrounds him even when he finally gets his boxing career on line.<br/><br/>So, although on paper The Fighter contains all the typical genre tropes, it provides a raw, unflinching insight into the domestic pressures a journeyman boxer must overcome from which most other boxing movies shy away. This is probably one of the top five US movies of 2010."

","Mark Whalberg and Christian Bale are The Fighters, in The Fighter. What I like about the title is that you're not sure who its meant for, because both Micky(Whalberg) and Dicky(Bale) are fighters. I know its a simple observation, but whatever.<br/><br/>The film tells the true story of Micky Ward, an aspiring boxer, and his crack head stepbrother, Dicky Eklund, who is his trainer. Once Mickey meets Charlene(Amy Adams) and Dicky goes to jail, Mickey rises. But once Dicky gets out of jail, there is a lot of family problems. Actually, there's a lot of family problems while he's in jail too.<br/><br/>The academy really took Christian Bale for granted for way too long. Ever since American psycho, which I think is his best performance. His work here is pure brilliance. Thats one of the great things about Bale: He puts a lot of effort into every single one of his roles, like Daniel Day Lewis. Oscar well deserved.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors are all great. Melissa Leo is great in her Oscar winning role as Micky's stepmother. Though the film isn't as good as Raging Bull, Million Dollar baby, or The Wrestler, The Fighter is a heartfelt and wonderful film about family. Thats really what its all about.

","Christian Bale again suffers for his art, here portraying a character physically and emotionally as different from his other roles, ""Machinist"" notwithstanding, that on occasion, it is difficult to truly believe it is him.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg takes on the less showy role of Welterweight ""Irish"" Mickey Ward, an aspiring boxer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Living in the shadow of his ""coulda been a contender"" and ""Pride of Lowell"" brother Dicky Eklund, who lost to Sugar Ray Leonard but not before he allegedly knocked him down on the canvas.<br/><br/>Eklund does not take the loss well and when we first meet the extended family in 1993, he is at a low ebb, addicted to Crack but just managing to train Mickey as he sets him on his own long road to boxing fame and fortune.<br/><br/>Mickey comes from a large family with a bevy of shrill sisters and a perma blond matriarch in the form of Oscar winning Melissa Leo as Alice Eklund. Tough as old boots and fiercely protective of her brood, her long suffering husband George Ward (McGee) is merely along for the ride and to keep the peace as best he can.<br/><br/>Following a disastrous fight that he should never have fought, events spiral out of control and Eklund finds himself in prison with Mickey forced to make hard choices for his stalled career.<br/><br/>This is a very effective and believable film based on true events. The period setting is good and the acting on display is first rate by all the supporting actors. Bale is astonishingly good, a bundle of ticks, constantly mugging for the documentary camera that follows him around, his lost dreams permanently etched on his face. He is constantly only seconds away from his come back that everyone, apart from himself, knows will never come.<br/><br/>A later scene where he is forced to watch ""his Hollywood moment"" is impressive in so many ways, realization slowly dawning upon him, his bravado ebbing away, as he accepts that without real change, his life is effectively over.<br/><br/>Wahlberg is solid as Mickey, adequate but no more and is really the only character, along with girlfriend Charlene (Amy Mcadams), that the audience may actually sympathise with. Mother Alice and her brood are portrayed as monumentally blinkered and ignorant, certainly their acting, especially Leo, is enough to set your teeth on edge and may instill a desire to lob anything handy at the screen, whenever they are around.<br/><br/>Eklund too presents an unlovable figure, he clearly has the biggest character arc to follow and Bale makes no mistakes in sketching him and remains believable throughout. The boxing scenes are well filmed, Wahlberg certainly looks the part and at no time do the bouts appear fake.<br/><br/>The story is very linear and follows a well worn path, on occasion you almost miss the Rocky theme music during the training montages, which are now almost a cliché but are necessary for the story.<br/><br/>There is a lot of shouting and realistic swearing, which is entirely in keeping with the film but on occasion the film does not make for an easy and enjoyable watch. If you have an aversion to boxing this may not be for you, whilst not ""about"" boxing, the film does spend a fair bit of time in and around the ring.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Realistic, superbly acted with two Oscar winning turns, this is Rocky for the new generation but stripped of all glamour and based on a true story, this is stirring stuff indeed.<br/><br/>Recommended as long as the subject matter interests.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In the seventies, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) was riding high as a boxing sensation, but two decades later, he's succumbed to a crippling crack addiction and gets by committing petty crimes to fund his habit. All the attention's now turned to his younger brother Micky (Mark Whalberg), the new 'great white hope.' Micky has a natural talent and ability, which could take him very far, if all the things and people around him don't conspire to stop him reaching his goals.<br/><br/>The boxer is a familiar figure to feature in stories of the 'underdog' who triumpths against all odds. The appeal of these movies is their relatability, since there are far more lost souls not reaching their full potential out there in this world than there are real success stories, and this character, with little else to get by on other than their raw toughness, resilience and determination to be 'the best', seems to embody this description really well. Often coming from poor, deprived backgrounds, with trashy friends and family toughened by the same rough social conditions as them who, while some might mean well, all the same conspire in some way without even realizing it, to hold them down and keep them there with them, this figure often faces tough adversity in their journey to rise themselves out from the gutter and will doubtless run into moments of self doubt and enraged frustration along the way. But, in a rough and cynical world, in the end their hard work pays off and one moment of brief, fleeting but over whelming luck runs their way and they (and the audience) feel that bit better. Basically, The Fighter follows this formula to a tee, but while it's most obviously a Rocky clone, it has elements of that film but also of that other most famous of the boxing movies, Robert De Niro's Raging Bull, with it being partly told in flashback with the two main characters talking into a camera at the beginning and end, re-living past glories and prepping each other up.<br/><br/>While it's ultimately a very predictable story, David O' Russell's film is never sentimental or corny, or without it's little flairs that make it stand out on it's own, most notably Bale's wild, quirky older brother character, whose pathetic addiction and increasingly pitiful existence never manages to erode his natural charisma and easy charm with people. Whalberg doesn't particularly stretch himself in the lead role, but his natural monosyllabic drone and drawl fit him to the role perfectly and mean he can pull it off with ease. Mention should also go to Amy Adams, as feisty, upfront love interest Charlene, another product of the rough, trashy environment all of the characters are caught up in. This type of film is the sort the Academy and critics always lap up, and while it's not in any way ground breaking or original enough to be anything more than okay, it's well made and solid enough to be nowhere near average. ***"

","After you watch the movie and get a glimpse of the real characters shown in the end, it will evoke an immediate applause in your mind for Christian Bale aka Dicky in the movie. The Fighter is yet another incredible true story that will touch upon a lot of spheres of life and relay inspiring thoughts very subtly. It does not pack the intensity or punches like other boxing movies, but will definitely make an impressive impact.<br/><br/>The direction and screenplay are a clean cut and although there is very little wiggle room with any real story, it still manages to let a viewer derive their own likeness to the characters and draw inspiration through many scenes. Mark Wahlberg is a effortless natural through out the movie and the cast playing the family all do justice to their little roles. Amy Adams will grab your attention with her delivery and will prove her potential yet again how far she has come from Sex and the City. The story overall is not about a big comeback or about nail biting boxing matches, its about a spirit of fighting and the fighter here is Dicky.<br/><br/>You may be a big Christian Bale fan or may have just heard about his crazy role preps for movies like Machinist, but make no assumptions or mistakes about this guy's performances. He proves yet again why he is Oscar material and goes way beyond just the look of a character. Bale is the heart beat of this drama and delivers all the punches outside the boxing ring. Just a couple scenes like his jumps in the trash and singing to his mother in the car display the ability of Bale to get sucked into a character. There is nothing extra ordinary about this story but the character of Dicky makes this more than worth watching.<br/><br/>Its not just head and body, its head, body, and heart from Christian Bale to deliver another Knock Out!

Then comes Christian Bale, he seemed to have lost a lot of weight to be the part. It was well worth it and he was amazing and deserving of the Oscar too. Melissa Leo as their mum was fantastic and also deserving of the Oscar. And the silent girlfriend to Micky, Amy Adams was cool. From her sweet princess image, this was a welcome change. Boxing is a real mind game and teamwork no doubt. Yes you are alone in the ring with the component, but if your coach is not good or tenacious then you have no hidden punch or trick to bring up and settle the round. Also don't give up on your dream or stop being who you really are. Everybody deserves a chance and when Micky made his choice it was meant to be. A good example for inspiration and basically brings out the reality of things, they don't have to come in fancy packages but life is full of small punches and you need to handle how to take them to make your dream come true."

","I've always liked sports films for their motivational nature and the never say die attitude portrayed in the movie. Owing to the high success rate of such films, a redundancy of films also occurred which caused many people including me to sideline this genre entirely due to the overdose. My approach to 'The Fighter' had been similar. Though it starred two big Hollywood stars, I expected it to be just another sports film and conveniently ignored it for a while. But the entire Oscar buzz around it led me to watching the film eventually and boy! I couldn't have been more wrong. It is much more than what I expected it to be. The Fighter is the story of Micky Ward and his older half-brother Dicky Eklund played by Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale respectively. The movie starts with Dicky, being a former boxer who lost his career to drugs and crime, training his younger brother Micky for an upcoming tournament but not being entirely sincere with it owing to his 'Crack' addiction. This causes Micky to lose many a times also accompanied by his mother's mismanagement. After an incident which causes Dicky to be jailed, Micky is approached by a new manager and a trainer who work hard with him only on the condition that he never gets back to his brother. Accompanied by the constant support of his girlfriend Charlene, played by Amy Adams he gets on success track but also realizes his brother's contribution at the same time. Dicky gets released from jail and approaches Micky claiming he has really changed. Does Micky take him back? Does he have it in him to approach high pressure matches without his brother? What about the promise he made to his team? Will having his brother back sabotage his chances of winning the title? These questions are answered in the rest of the movie. The movie is beautifully set in Lowell, Massachusetts, where the settings and the background sink perfectly into the movie making you feel like it is a true life story (It is!!). Coming to the performances, one actor stands above them all and it is undoubtedly Christian Bale. He plays the part of a crack addict with such elegance and conviction that it's hard to believe it is the same person we saw as the billionaire Bruce Wayne. The performance in short is, ineffable. Mark Wahlberg underplays as the underdog boxer. And the rest were commendable too. The prime attribute of the film is that one cannot classify it under a genre. It is a drama which focuses on human relations and emotions as much as it does on the spirit of sports. Though slow, it never loses its grip on the audience. It is the story of triumph over adversity both in and out of the boxing ring which finally proves a point that the factors for success maybe numerous and unimaginable. The main reasons to watch this film are to experience one of the best performances in recent times and to see a real life story connect powerfully with you."

","THE FIGHTER breaks no new ground as a film. There are many films with the same theme ('Fighting Tommy Riley' is one of the best, but there are many others) despite the fact that this one is based on a true story. There is nothing to really fault in this film: it just doesn't quite live up to the honors and hype afforded it. Writers Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson have managed to create dialogue and encourage accents specific to the Lowell, Massachusetts setting and their script has a steady flow that makes the film work. David O. Russell directs a fine cast and makes the most of the secondary stories that take the film out of the ring and into the lives of the Ward family in a credible way. <br/><br/>Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg in a very sensitive, underplayed and under-appreciated performance) is the younger brother of Dicky Ekland - same mother, different fathers - (Christian Bale, gaunt and frighteningly real as a crack addict) who came close to the big time in boxing, a potential hero of Lowell, MA. Dicky is Micky's wholly unreliable trainer and the devotion between the two brothers is palpable. The 'manager' of Micky's would-be boxing career is the boys' mother Alice (Melissa Leo). Micky fights losing fight after losing fight until he meets a bartender girl Charlene (Amy Adams) who steers him away form the bad influence of his family - a move that allows Micky to begin to rise in the boxing ranks. Dicky is imprisoned for multiple charges and gets clean and upon release works with Micky again to lead him to victory. <br/><br/>The Ward family - including father George (Jack McKee) is a mangy bunch- the sisters are made up to appear as tacky as young girls can look and talk. Melissa Leo is credible as the arrogant yet devoted materfamilias, Christian Bale is stunning in his portrayal of the pathetic Dicky, but Mark Wahlberg is rock solid as the quiet but committed fighter/brother/son. This is probably not a film to see twice but the first viewing is entertaining. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

The catch is neither his brother (Bale) who has trained him his whole life, or his mother (Melissa Leo) can have anything to do with him. This is a great movie. It is a boxing movie, but much like ""Raging Bull"" boxing is only part of the story. The focus is mostly on the family and how important they are in Micky's life, and how they don't always return the love and need Micky has for them. Being a true story (also like ""Raging Bull"") makes this movie much more enjoyable and tense, knowing that all of what is happening really went on. Amy Adams is great in the movie. This is a total departure from what she usually does (if you don't believe me watch this and then ""Enchanted""). But I think this movie would not have been nearly as good without Bale.

","If you thought you knew what white trash was then watch The Fighter and it will introduce you to a whole new grotesque and degrading level. The Fighter is based on the true story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward and his climb to the top of boxing fame. However, the movie isn't as much about Micky's boxing career as it is about him and his family and how his career is strongly affected by the white trash nut jobs in his family. First off there's his brother, Dicky Eklund. Dicky was himself a fighter at one point, but when his career started to wane he began smoking crack and his addiction turned him in to the pathetic human being he is in this film. Then there is Micky's mother, Alice, who is also his manager. She is borderline insane and incredibly controlling, She also has seven daughters, each uglier and more obnoxious than the other. The seven of them are almost one character whose opinions are always let out unanimously and they each bounce off of each other in some of the funniest banter of the film. Their family is fascinating as well as disgusting.<br/><br/>It's hard to get the most out of a film when the majority of the characters are just such horrible, white trash, sleeze bags with hardly any redeeming qualities. The family dynamics in the film are also always changing, making it hard to decipher just how much you like or dislike these characters. At heart, these characters all love each other and there is a strong theme of family ties throughout this film. But there are those times where these characters are pointlessly mean to each other, but you can argue that this all stems from their white trash lifestyle. But it's this bottom of the barrel lifestyle that really makes these characters much less likable than they should be. Of course the film is based on a true story so to make them more respectable human beings may have skewed the point of the film.<br/><br/>But no matter how deplorable these people are, I cannot deny that the actors portraying them all do a superb job. The film one two Academy Awards, both acting, and it deserved both of them. Christian Bale plays Dicky Eklund, a role which he lost a scary amount of weight for. Bale does a ridiculously good job in the film. Dicky is arguable the most interesting character of the film, possibly because of how perfectly he was portrayed. Bale finds the perfect balance between over the top crack addict and an emotionally fueled man who, deep down, has a big heart. Melissa Leo plays Alice, Micky's mother, and she also captures the perfect balance in her character. Her dialouge also has that fast paced inner city cadence coupled with an excellent inner city accent. Amy Adams plays Charlene, Micky's girlfriend, and she is excellent. She is far from a damsel in distress character dating a boxer for protection. In some ways shes stronger than Micky and Amy Adams' tough and outward demeanor makes her a perfect casting choice. The main character of the film, Micky Ward, is played by Mark Wahlberg. I also go back and forth on Wahlberg and I would have to say that in The Fighter he is the lowest point as far as acting goes. He tries very hard and he is undoubtedly dedicated to his role, but his performance is lackluster and is heavily overshadowed by his superior supporting cast.<br/><br/>So I've made it clear that the characters in this film aren't exactly likable and a lot of what goes on between them is a little disheartening and off putting. But what really saves this is the fact that The Fighter is just a really well made film. David O. Russell directs with a fantastic personal eye. There are some fantastic shots that last for minutes at a time, sweeping back and forth between characters as they argue and bicker. He also shoots the boxing scenes with a different camera or something, because he makes it look as if the fight is actually on TV. It's fascinating and very enthralling to watch. The boxing scenes are also very realistic and brutal so as to grip your emotions so tight that you can't look away as two men beat each other senseless. The dialouge is also great. There are no throwaway lines or pointless scenes and the flow of the dialouge stays very consistent, as does the flow of the entire film. This is a film that tries, producing something very high quality and in no way half-assed.<br/><br/>The Fighter is an excellent film, despite any problems I had with the characters and the despicable ways in which they treated each other at times. These people just come from a different world, and it isn't a world that want to relate to at all. Because of this, I feel like there is a very thin barrier keeping me from loving this film as much as I could have. But this barrier doesn't keep me from seeing just how well this film is made and just how superb the actors are. This is a must see for fans of boxing films. It's no Raging Bull, but it is still quite the film."

","The Fighter: It's a true story about the early years of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him and Christian Bale physically transforms himself to resemble the real guy to the T.An Oscar very well deserved. Apart from the interesting boxing matches ( I don't enjoy the sport) it also talks a lot about relationships and how mothers build a world around themselves not ready to believe the truth about their children, about people on addiction not able to grasp the mess their lives are in and the gravity of the situation, A person(Mark Walberg) who is capable of achieving much more but is limited due to family obligations or what his family thinks is best for him , a family who wants to do good by one son while still living in an unreal world of hope for another and thus also unknowingly pulling down Mark. Also Amy Adams plays a Girl friend who is not miss goody two shoes and gives it back as good as she gets it, says sorry when she is wrong and accepts that she might have not achieved much in life herself but wants what is best for her BF Mark.Melissa Leo who plays the mom gives great facial expressions of disappointments and when she is happy for her sons and sorry for her behavior and scared when mark gets thrashed in the boxing ring. With 2 Oscar wins you gotta watch this one for sure."
"admiralmurf","8","0","0","23 February 2011"," Definitely a good movie, but nothing past that.
","The Fighter was the type of film that intrigues every boxing fan and cinema goer. You look at the film and think ""it's about boxing, it is critically acclaimed, nominated for several Oscars, and is a true story"". However, I cannot deny that I did feel let down by this movie, as it definitely did not live up to expectations.<br/><br/>As a brief synopsis, The Fighter tells the story of 'Irish' Mickey Ward's rise to become a champion against the odds, and his brother Dicky Eklund's addiction to crack. First and foremost, this isn't exactly a typical boxing film; it's more about the intra-family relationships around the brothers and, even more importantly, the relationship between the brothers. This is all that is really worth saying about the story to people that haven't seen it.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is definitely a split between the good, the bad, and the ugly. To get it out of the way, Mickey Ward's family cover the 'ugly' side of this. Now, to begin, Mark Wahlberg is his typical wooden self in this role. Perhaps the only reason he got this role was because he could provide muscle? The only redeeming feature is Christian Bale as Dicky Eklund. Especially to people that have seen the roles Bale normally plays, this will be a surprise. The performance is a joy to behold, especially during the credits when the real Ward and Eklund speak and you see how close to the real thing Bale got. Apart from his impersonation of Dicky Eklund, Bale plays a crack addict very well. There is a particularly moving scene of Eklund rolling in agony whilst he is incarcerated for numerous charges brought about for raising money for his brother, due to the withdrawal symptoms caused by not having crack in prison.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the movie is okay. It is not the most spectacular storyline you'll ever see, but this can always be excused when a true story is being told. However, most boxing fans will know Mickey Ward for his saga of fights with Arturo Gatti, none of which are shown in this movie, since it ends after he becomes champion. This was a little bit disappointing, but I guess it feeds into the fact that this is more a story of love and family than a boxing movie.<br/><br/>Whoever gave the filming tips or artistic direction of the movie can be saluted. I personally thought it was a great idea to switch to more of a television camera for the fights to make it more realistic. Otherwise, nothing to exotic is used through any of the normal scenes. The only other thing I would add is that I personally thought the text used over the screen looked very amateur, but it isn't the most important factor in a film.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is definitely a good movie, but nothing past that. The nature of the film and the hype it is given makes me feel a sort of pressure to give it a higher rating. However, anything past this would undermine the quality of better movies."

","The Fighter is a well made Hollywood movie, similar in some ways to Cinderella Man. Both movies are well acted with stylish direction. Both suffer in my opinion by playing around with the truth. The stories were already interesting. The so-called World Title that Micky Ward wins, is not a serious World Title. The Title Fight was for the World Boxing Union Light Welterweight Title.<br/><br/>The World Boxing Union (WBU) is a poorly regarded boxing organization whose World Champions are often not given serious recognition, particularly in the U.S.A. WBU titles are used mainly to get some exposure, in order to get better fights. Most WBU title fights take place under the promotion of British promoter Frank Warren's Sports Network. Micky Ward never defended the title. Five months after winning the ""Title"" he lost his next fight in the U.S.A. He never fought for one of the Major Titles.<br/><br/>None of that matters. His story is still inspirational. Why the need to Gild the Lily?"

","This is a movie where Mark Wahlberg is literally phenomenal in and this role was just perfect for him. Christian Bale has﻿ it locked for best supporting actor. The plot is basically based on a true story about a welter weight boxing champion Micky Ward(Mark Wahlberg) and the plot is a back story to what happened before he became the champion. And all the obstacles he had to overcome in the ring and outside the ring to reach success in boxing. The story is pretty good but the movie can be a bit slow at times and loses it's edge sometimes, however the acting is fantastic, even the minor characters stood out. Christian Bale gain and lose weight like magic and in this he had to lose a lot of weight, and he was a slightly better than Mark Wahlberg in this. His character was dramatic and funny, Amy Adams was pretty good in this and proves she is a good actress in this. Overall the performances in this is plain out amazing for the most part. On a negative side there really isn't a lot of fight scenes in this, and the fight sequences is okay but isn't anything great. The script and dialogue is what makes this movie really stand out, although it's pretty predictable and narrow at times. For a boxing movie this focuses more on the family drama and boxing is there as well but it isn't the entire focus of the movie. This is a realistic and believable film that is for the most part a knock out.<br/><br/>8.2/10"

"steve_koenig","6","3","8","8 February 2011"," Good acting, but a story you've seen many times before
","There seem to have been two types of boxing films over the years: 1) those showing the false hopes, and hard falls, of ultimately-doomed boxers (e.g., ""The Harder They Fall""); 2) and those showing a boxer rising from working class origins to, improbably, reach a title bout during which he's about to lose but then draws upon inner strength to win. This film is the latter. It's ""based on a true story,"" so it's not completely made-up (like ""Rocky""), but it's also not strictly factual (I don't know what parts were and which were not).<br/><br/>The one area in which the film stands out is acting. The Oscar-nominated performances by Christian Bale and Melissa Leo stand out. Bale, who submerges himself into his role enough that I didn't recognize him, is particularly worthy of his award. His apparently quick kicking of a cocaine addiction was the one part that seemed contrived. Leo convincingly plays a character so obnoxious that you don't want the inevitable reconciliation with Micky to take place. However, her quick change in behavior towards the end of the film did not ring true. Mark Wahlberg does a fine job, as does Amy Adams, playing a typical movie girlfriend standing by her man through hard times. Adams's acting seemed particularly, well, ordinary (not bad, just not special). I was very surprised at her nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The actresses playing the sisters did good jobs playing white trash babes with hair styles I haven't seen since the 1960s. I would not want to meet any of them in a dark alley-- or anywhere else, for that matter.<br/><br/>The scenes taking place in boxing rings look like those I've seen in dozens of films before. I am no boxing expert, but Wahlberg did not appear all that tired in the matches, even when he appeared he was about to lose. These scenes are inevitably matched with those of cheering friends and family watching the match on television. The climactic scene of his victory in the championship bout, with the cheers and hugs, was expected, and almost a cliché. Again, not badly done, but nothing I haven't seen before.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Fighter"" is a good, well-acted film with a familiar storyline and ending. You probably don't go expecting a surprise ending (especially if you see the film in someplace like Brazil, where the film is titled ""O Vencedor,"" meaning ""The Victor""), and news stories about the film, and well-publicized synopses, give away its ending. I can understand people enjoying the film, and some of the performances being awarded prizes, but I do not understand effusive praise declaring the film a 9 or 10 out of 10."
"illegal_alien51","4","3","9","23 March 2011"," Most of all disrespectful?
","First the good point:<br/><br/>The actors did quite a nice acting job, remembering how little development there actually is.<br/><br/>The bad points: The original two Rocky movies where more engaging than this and far ahead of this. The latest Rocky movie is better than this. Cinderella Man is much better than this. But most of all, The Wrestler is light years better than this and much more engaging. <br/><br/>This being a 2 hour movie everything goes sort of stale. A third of the movie is about the crack head brother and his useless life. A third of the movie is about a redneck hen house. The last third of the movie is dedicated to the rest. And this being primarily being a boxing movie it's almost sad that the boxing is just about 10% of the total.<br/><br/>But what really angers me is this: The movie depicts real life events that are very recent. Everybody is still alive, everybody is there to tell their story, yet they make a feature movie out of this?! They could have shown all people involved a little more respect and made a documentary about it! THAT I would have LOVED watching! That would have been REAL! They even got the real people this is about at the back of the movie in a little clip! Why not be a bit more respectful and actually make a movie about them - WITH them?"
"Turfseer","6","2","5","25 April 2011"," Overlong, feel good take on boxing family dysfunction, still entertains
","With so many fight flicks out there, it helps to be a little bit different. The film's creator, Mark Wahlberg, wisely explores Prizefighter Micky Ward's family conflicts for three quarters of the film, rather than dwelling mainly on the conflicts in the ring. Wahlberg was attracted to Ward's story since they both grew up in large families, in a working class Massachusetts environment. For those who have no interest in astrology, I apologize, but I would like to point out that the natural inquisitive nature of a Gemini (Wahlberg), goes quite well with the laid back, easygoing Libran (Ward). What we end up with 'The Fighter' is an 'airy' concoction—a film that manages to exude a 'feel good' sensibility coupled with the strong dialectic between two brothers, whose mutual attraction and repulsion is constantly shifting.<br/><br/>Since 'The Fighter' is based on the true story of Ward's rise to the top as a champion welterweight, whenever reality weasels its way into the narrative, the film is quite absorbing. The entire scene where Ward, goaded by his mother, agrees to fight an opponent twenty pounds heavier than he is, and then gets his ass kicked, is something I've never seen before in a boxing film. Ward's brother, Dicky (played by a chameleon-like Christian Bale), also provides a great deal of 'color' to an otherwise traditional tale of pugilistic ambition. Who can forget when Micky ignores his trainer's game plan and adopts his brother's strategy to win the title fight? This despite Dicky's continual descent into the hellhole of crack addiction.<br/><br/>The bulk of 'The Fighter', however, is much more a tale of filial obligation (or should I say obsession?) than the history of Micky Ward's ascent to the welterweight crown. Why does it take Micky so long to realize that Dicky is actually holding him back? The answer in a nutshell is misguided filial obligation. A deeper subtext is that the Ward brothers are both in an unconscious incestuous relationship with their mother (played by an over the top Melissa Leo). While Micky eventually breaks free, Dicky takes a more circuitous route toward redemption. He must first go to prison where he finally overcomes his crack addiction and eventually allows his brother to fight without any conditions (that is, with Dicky no longer acting as if his brother owed him something).<br/><br/>I would urge anyone who has seen 'The Fighter', to also see Visconti's ""Rocco and his Brothers""--both films deal with two brothers who are prizefighters. In 'Rocco', the stakes are much higher: the successful prizefighter brother also has a misguided filial obligation to his now washed up sibling. Unlike Dicky (who eventually gives up his unhealthy family relationships), Rocco covers for his brother who has committed both rape and murder. Unlike the Visconti classic, Wahlberg is content to offer up a happy ending, where Dicky is welcomed into Micky's new boxing family, accepted by them despite all the past recriminations.<br/><br/>The three principals here all acquit themselves well. The most impressive aspect of Wahlberg's performance is his physical conditioning; he trained for four years to get himself into shape to play this role. Even better is Christian Bale as Dicky. Bale lost approximately sixty pounds to play Micky's crack-addicted brother; when you first see him, you won't even realize it's Christian Bale. Amy Adams finally breaks out of her 'good girl' roles and plays a sexy, working class gal who helps Micky break his ties with his mother.<br/><br/>Less successful is Melissa Leo as Alice Ward, the mother of the seven daughters. Yes, we get the idea that she's a control freak, but does all that 'control freak' stuff have to repeat itself ad infinitum? The daughters (described by many critics as a virtual ""Greek Chorus""), provide additional cartoonish machinations; the stale comic relief reaches its apotheosis in the scene where the daughters try and pummel Micky's girlfriend, Charlene.<br/><br/>Micky Ward's victory during the Championship Fight in London seems a bit anti-climactic. Wahlberg went to great lengths to reproduce the actual fight as it appeared on HBO in 2000. The actual recording of the HBO announcers was utilized during the film and the fight sequences were choreographed to match the actual movements of the boxers. It just seems kind of lazy to pad the end of your film with the reproduction of an actual event, which you could probably better enjoy by watching the real thing.<br/><br/>'The Fighter' probably would have worked better had it been cut down by about 20 to 30 minutes. A good number of the scenes feel as if they're improvised and sometimes drag a bit. Nonetheless, the holy trinity of Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, make this fairly traditional boxing yarn, entertaining. Wahlberg stays true to his Gemini sign—there is something for everybody here: whether it be over the top acting performances, intense family conflict with incestuous undertones and gritty recreations of fighters plying their trade in the ring."

What a difficult choice for the Oscar between the King's Speech and this a totally different film but based on a true story.<br/><br/>I was so caught up in the excitement of it, I do not know where the time went. The film was absolutely funny and serious at the same time. It gives you a feeling for how devastating and corrupting addiction can be. It also has a statement about family. As internally combustible as the family was they still loved each other in their own way. They used and abused each other but they were there for one another. <br/><br/>The community of Lowell is probably not unlike many blue collar and poverty stricken areas. One gets insight into the mentality, the anti intellectualism of it but the love of it too. It was these two feelings of the hardness of life but the love of family and support of it no matter how dysfunctional. If you ever think your family is difficult watch the film. Very humorous too in many ways.<br/><br/>I suppose the boxing arena is a metaphor as well for the rough and tumble clawing of life to try to be a success and never giving up even when you think you cannot go another mile you do. Where there is life there is hope.<br/><br/>Just loved this film and if it were earlier I would related more but just getting my feelings about the film out I give it a 10!"

","Why does a film with great performances by Christian Bale, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams leave one so unsatisfied? First, Mark Wahlberg is the lead and he has difficulty holding up his part against the showy performances by the already mentioned trio of Bale, Leo and Adams. Many newspaper articles questioned why Wahlberg was not nominated for an Oscar while his three costars were. My simple answer is that his performance is not very good. (Yes, its difficult for a star to hold a film together while his supporting players get to chew the scenery. But real stars can -- think Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs, holding the focus of the film against Tony Hopkins over-the-top performance.) Second, the film starts as a character study and ends up being a sports history picture. The ending feels like a different film compared to the beginning and middle. The structure and writing of the film leave something to be desired. Bottom line - you'll find several of the performances worth watching but you might find the film lacking."

Personally I'd still give that title to American Psycho, but this one is less likely to be a controversy. Amy Adams breaks some new ground as well, having gone from playing small and frail, to putting on a few pounds, and picking cat fights.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a collaborative effort.

"thewillt08","6","1","2","2 September 2012"," At Least it Wasn't A Comedy
","Thank God, Mark Wahlberg isn't trying to make me laugh; he did what he does best. The Fighter, based on a true story about these two boxer brothers from Lowell Massachusetts who struggle in the business of boxing. Mickey, Wahlberg is the younger boxer who is trying to make it big time and be like his older brother Dickey. Dickey, Christian Bale, is well past his prime and is a crack head. He has been in and out of jail and is tagged The Pride of Lowell. Dickey and his parents are the managers of Mickey. Mickey lives in his brother's shadow and he wants to be different. He struggles with his family, his career, his new girlfriend, and himself. <br/><br/>Wahlberg did a great job acting in this movie. He knows how to act and he exceeded my expectations after some of the movies he did previously. His character is complex and sometimes the audience agrees with him, and sometimes he can be a bit selfish. He struggles with potential for greatness and loyalty to his family. Christian Bale stole the show however with his acting as the drug abuser and troubled older brother. I had no idea that the man who played Batman could take on a role like this. He blew me away with his performance. His character was a has-been whose career highlight was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard. He is hogging the spotlight so to speak and that causes problems between him and his brother. <br/><br/>At times I thought the story was slow and a little boring. Not much happened. It reminded me a lot of Rocky but more fighting. I would have liked to see more action but there were a lot of emotional scenes with important characters which I did like a lot. Sometimes I was a bit confused with the story and I wasn't sure what the point was or where the story was going. I even felt like how Mickey felt. Was the story more about Mickey or Dickey? Whose story was it? Who was the major focus on? I understand it could have been both but one needed to be the primary and another needed to be a secondary. They both tried to b e the primary and it confused the story. Mickey wants to be a successful fighter while Dickey is making a documentary about him and trying to make a comeback, but ends up in prison. There seemed to be too much going on with too many characters. <br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie, it wasn't great but it wasn't awful. I heard it was fantastic before I saw it but it was not as good as I expected. Parts were really good, others were not. The fighting itself looked a lot better. It looked like blows were actually hitting and the punches sounded real. Actors had to do a lot of preparation for specific roles and the audience needs to appreciate that. Christian Bale definitely gets the WillyT seal of approval but the movie itself does not. It is a movie I'm glad I saw but I probably will not see it again. You can casually watch it, meaning you can do something on the internet or have distractions while it's on. Watch it with friends or alone, it doesn't really matter because you will get the same experience. The fact that it was based on a true story was cool and I did enjoy that the actually brothers were shown at the end credits."

","A look at the early years of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward and his brother who helped train him before going pro in the mid 1980s.<br/><br/>The Fighter comes with all the right tools to become a great boxing movie... It had a cast: Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale; two amazing actors who really dig into the movie rather than play around with it. It had a plot: a movie based on true events, while also maintaining focus on the drama outside of the ring. So I basically had high expectations, as all of these can structure a movie into something worth watching, or something worth feeling...<br/><br/>The Fighter is just average. Now I say that knowing that people won't agree, but sadly the Fighter as been done too many times before in these kind of films. It has great fighting scenes (spectacular, actually) and DOES focus on more than the fighting, but it got carried away trying to be bigger and badder than it needed to be. The plot outside the ring was honestly clichéd, and never held the emotional punch it intended to do. But the one thing that saved this film from being the 6 is the acting. Mark Wahlberg was fantastic as a character we can actually hold interest in. They didn't cliché him as much they did Christian Bale, but although he was a bit clichéd, he did a fantastic job! He antics resembled a real junkie and his acting was a tremendous step outside the Batman trilogy. He held the power to hold a realistic performance but withheld the power to step away from these fighting movie clichés. Other than that, the acting was the thing steaming from this film. And the plot.. it's too contrived. I've seen the boxing film before, many times actually, but where?<br/><br/>Should you see it? .. Although the movie IS clichéd, and it never strays away from becoming what other films have become, the movie has so many redeeming qualities I can't give it a BAD score. It was well-acted, the fight scenes were realistic, and the cast was well-resembled. I recommend it for the noobs for the genre, but any thing outside of that, it's just another typical fighting film. 7/10."

","The Fighter is one of those films that you can look at say, they just don't make films like this anymore. I've seen many true stories of films back from the 70's and 80's and even 90's and I had a few little doubts since this film came out in 2010. Either way I knew it was going to be good because Mark Waulberg and Christian Bale were the leads but I had no idea that the whole film all together.<br/><br/>The basic plot is set on a true story where there is a guy called Micky who is fighting to become world champion and he has his half brother Dicky and his whole family by his side to support him. When things start getting in a muddle and he gets a girl friend, all hell brakes loose and it goes into a rioting situation. Micky must get his brother back on the right track and get back on his feet to become world champ.<br/><br/>I thought this story was quite powerful throughout and I think it did do many films of the year 2010 a lot of justice. It had meaning and it explains it well when they're at home, on the street or even in the ring.<br/><br/>Mark Waulberg is outstanding as the tough, but nice boxer Micky who wants to achieve a lot in his life at becoming the world champ. Christian Bale brings life to the character of the hip-hop Dicky who always wants to be at his brother's side. I've never seen Christian Bale in a role like this before since ""American Psycho"" and ""The Dark Knight"" so it was a tremendous cross over to see him play a character like Dicky. The rest of the cast definitely backed them up making the entire cast as solid as hitting bricks. I've also never seen Amy Adams before and she was like a light bringing all of her energy to her roll. I was impressed I also loved the change in cinematography with when they're talking or interacting, it's a modernized look to the film while as when the fights happen in the ring, it looks so real and documentized. I loved that change because it changed the overall tone and atmosphere to the story and to the characters themselves about how they would act and think.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a powerful film with an excellent true story, well all around casted actors and it has many messages to send out to the viewer.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Even if this is based on a true story (family), it is not the first time you see a story like this unfold on the screen. So why does this attempt (X) should be the one to watch, especially if you have seen other movies like that? Apart from the powerhouse performances, this might be the movie that portrays a family with all their sides, in its most honest and brutal way.<br/><br/>No punch is being hold back. It's always full force and you get to see the impact. It's humans interacting. And Bale well deserved the Oscar, even if Wahlberg was the one who was the driving force behind this movie even being made. He again seems to get into the role completely. He is one with the character (real life) and gives one of his better performances in recent years. The sisters are just great (like them or not) and Amy Adams has her own head and her own mind (not always a given)."

After checking its score and reading some reviews here on IMDb, I decided to see it.<br/><br/>I have to admit that this has been the only movie of Christian Bale that I got really bored watching. I know the movie won Academy Awards and received lots of nice reviews but I didn't like it. I forced myself to finish it. I am not a pro movie critic and I cannot talk about the details what make a movie and if this title satisfies them etc. I can only say whether I liked or not.<br/><br/>In summary, I didn't like this movie at all and it is certainly not in my to-be-watched-again list."

When I heard about this movie I thought that this was a real life ""Rocky"":. I would say that the budget for Rocky must have been a lot more. The sound for instance was muted mo upbeat to move the audience, no action climax like the movie Rocky. Also the time frame was compressed. It seemed like everything happened in 6 months when it is over 5 years span. The scenes were in a compressed very small rooms and gave an illusions of claustrophobia. In short wait for the DVD. Don't waste your money."
"darrhling","7","1","2","18 May 2011"," Not just about boxing!
","I watched this film with high expectations in view of all the academy award nominations and hype. I was not disappointed. I had qualms about this being a film just for people who love the art of boxing, but it definitely goes beyond that, exploring moral values, loyalty and, first and foremost, family.<br/><br/>The Fighter centres on the relationship between two brothers. Drug-addict Dicky, the family superstar, constantly overshadows his younger brother (Christian Bale), who does his best to balance his love for his brother with the fact that Dicky's interference in his life is highly destructive. This is, however, a tale of second chances, priorities and sheer determination. Simultaneously sad and uplifting.<br/><br/>However, no matter how emotionally involving The Fighter is, it falls just short of truly great. It is a very well-constructed film, but also a fairly predictable one. It falls below Million Dollar Baby, whilst exploring a similar area (boxing, emotions and values, low-income families), which is a dangerous thing to do if one doesn't want to be accused of unoriginality.<br/><br/>Bale fully deserved his Oscar and this is a serious film for thinking people, definitely worth watching, but not something that will leave you astounded and rethinking the world."
"oneguyrambling","7","1","2","25 April 2011"," The Fighter is an unexpected contender.
","Ex-boxer Dicky Ecklund has fallen spectacularly from grace and is now skinny, drawn and gaunt. In short he doesn't appear like a boxer at all.<br/><br/>Nevertheless Dicky – now 40ish and balding a little – takes almost every opportunity to remind one and all of his former glories and how he laid out Sugar Ray Leonard, even if he ended up losing the fight and not taking the title. The other opportunities and moments are spent sourcing crack and co-habiting with similarly unreliable and disreputable ""associates"".<br/><br/>Dicky thinks that the camera crew following he and half-brother Mickey Ward around are documenting his comeback and rise back to the big leagues, not the stuttering but promising career of younger Mickey.<br/><br/>The boy's Mum Alice doesn't help matters either, her every breath is spent reminiscing over Dicky's past (near) glories and talking up his bright future, the fact that she is supposed to be Mickey's present manager doesn't come up much in conversation and apparently hardly dominates her thoughts either.<br/><br/>The Ward household is tight but perhaps not altogether focused or ideal. Mickey's career has lost direction to the point that he nearly quits the game more than once, with numerous skanky, opinionated sisters in the wings like hungry vultures, and only Mickey's Father George Ward and local cop Mickey O'Keefe are truly behind his career all the way, unfortunately they aren't as opinionated or forceful with their opinions as Dicky and the Ward women.<br/><br/>Dicky seems to truly believe that big things are on the horizon for him even though he smokes, does drugs and revels in former glories (with stories and legends that may or may not even be accurate).<br/><br/>Every story and conversation inevitably comes back to him – often though at Alice's doing – and Dicky delights in any and all attention and suggestion that he put Lowell, the working class Boston community in which they live, on the map.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Mickey trains, keeps his mouth shut and bides his time as poorly chosen opponents and the ""wonderful, ethical world of boxing"" conspires to see his career end without success or recognition.<br/><br/>That is until he meets Charlene, as with many of the women in this film Charlene is loud, profane and speaks her mind at all times – though in this case she is on Mickey's side. Mickey has never had someone stick up for him so forcefully before, with both dad George and O'Keefe being meek and often shouted over anyway.<br/><br/>On his first date with Charlene Mickey tries to impress and takes her to an art-house cinema, whereupon exiting Charlene complains that she ""had to read the f*ckin' movie"". Mickey tells Charlene everything, that he has a young daughter (to an uncooperative and vindictive ex), and the story behind his repeated inability to break big in the boxing world.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it seems Mickey's loving family has really been more hindrance than help, and his blind loyalty has only facilitated this drag on his momentum, Charlene immediately realises this and urges Mickey to take some action for himself.<br/><br/>Mickey is left with the choice of sticking with his family and perhaps settling for a dead-end career, or leaving them behind and having one real crack at the big time Of course those ""loyal"" to Mickey immediately seek to blame someone and come up with Charlene, who isn't taking a backward step from anyone.<br/><br/>Then two things happen, Dicky has a run in with the law, and the documentary is eventually released. After this the tone of the film – and mood of the family – changes permanently.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is fine as Mickey but he has little to do besides look buff and a little confused. Dicky (Christian Bale) and Alice (Melissa Leo) fare better, as being – let's face it – pretty ordinary and self-centred human beings their roles are basically more interesting.<br/><br/>While Leo is fine and continually frustrating as Alice, Bale steals the film as the delusional Dicky, dining out on faded and often false recollections, and inhabiting a largely worthless existence and looking towards a future that cannot be. Bale again lost a bunch of weight in this film and once again pulls off yet another non-English accent effortlessly, while The Fighter might not have been a big challenge for him to me it is simply another example of why he is perhaps the best – and easily the most fearless – actor working in film today.<br/><br/>A new boxing movie is released every year or two and in every interview the actors invariably boast about the authenticity of the fighting sequences, how making it 100% realistic was just so important to them and how they took more than their fair share of real hits along the way during filming.<br/><br/>The Fighter is no mere Rocky or Cinderella Man clone, there is only one brief training montage in the entire film, and even that isn't given the luxury of a loud hair-metal ballad blaring in the background.<br/><br/>That said the fights in The Fighter are OK, but they lack the urgency and audience involvement of a Rocky film (I don't how real Marky-Mark says they were or who and how they filmed them).<br/><br/>But in this case it hardly matters, the success and quality of The Fighter has little to do with the fight scenes, without the dramatic elements and the story of both Dicky and Mickey driving the plot along, the fight scenes wouldn't even matter and this would just be another meaningless boxing flick.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Less a fight film with a few dramatic elements than a drama film with a few fights. The Fighter is an unexpected contender."

I have never seen Christian Bale do a performance like that and definitely was the best supporting performance of that year.

The fighter is a great drama that i would recommend for everybody to see because it has definitely come to be one of my top ten movies this year, I have seen this movie twice already because it is so good it is a magnificent movie and David O.Russell has done a great job in directing this movie witch makes it so memorable.

","""To know a social class or even a portion of a social class is not simply a matter of rubbing shoulders with its members, or getting down pat all their mannerisms and language. It has something to do also with understanding the class as an objective historical factor, a phenomenon that goes beyond the level of individual consciousness and self-awareness."" - Joanne Laurier <br/><br/>David O. Russell's ""The Fighter"" takes all the boxing tropes from 1950s ring flicks and pushes them to more frenetic extremes, the family drama harsher, the grit grittier, the swearing louder and so forth. But it's all canned conflict, Russell, like Darren Aronofsky did recently with ""The Wrestler"", looking to get his career back on track with some audience/critic/studio pandering. See, ""The Fighter"" says, I can make crowd pleasing adult movies. But in Hollywood, ""adult"" is often code for fairy tales with R ratings.<br/><br/>Like ""The Wrestler"", ""The Fighter"" strives for a certain 1970's grittiness. But it's a overly manicured form of neo-realism, plastic and self-conscious. Russell's white trash characters are less ""real people"" than knowing copies. Though virtually his entire cast rings false, actor Christian Bale is the worst culprit. Yes he's playing a brain damaged crack addict, but Bale's manic look-at-me performance is nevertheless all surfaces and too little depth. When De Niro parroted La Motta parroting Brando in ""Raging Bull"", he still came across as a character. Here, Bale's parroting De Niro parroting La Motta parroting Brando parroting Terry Malloy. The result is less a character than a self-reflexive Polaroid, flapping in the wind.<br/><br/>The film's boxing sequences are themselves shot on video, epitomising the film's strange relationship with documentary realism. When Scorsese inserted faux family videos into ""Raging Bull"" you believed it. Three decades later, similar tactics have an odd awkwardness. Cinema verite once attempted to simulate reality. Now directors attempt to simulate cinema verite. The world too mediated, ground zero ""realism"" seems almost impossible to convincingly convey. Or maybe it no longer exists. Strangely, actor Mark Wahlberg, a born again Christian with newfound humility/devotion (he was once a street thug), is the only actor who comes across as a real person rather than a replicated image. The film's best moments involve him.<br/><br/>The ""boxing genre"" is largely a blue-collar world, so most of these films unconsciously say something about the American working class. Here the film aligns media domination and early 1990s techno-capitalism with both a culture of addiction and the corpse-like decomposition of the American Dream. For all its sexy style and Method pyrotechnics, something like ""Raging Bull"" was all hot air, masochism collapsing into a kind of Catholic guilt, each fight a station of the cross, each blow a desire for penance. But Russell's film, like Aronofsky's, is about a much larger assault on the body. Here, each of its two brothers (Mickey and Dicky) embodies a different fighting style. Dicky is feral, fast moving, flexible, whilst an unsuccessful Mickey is firmly planted, rooted, always entrenched. Now anachronistic, Mickey's a post industrial man being down sized and replaced by foreign strangers with small fingers and faster hands. In a way, he embodies what Gilles Deleuze calls the ""disciplinary society"", a cultural model which, like Mickey's dilapidating home town (Lowell, the birthplace of industrial America), can't seem to cope with the 21st century. The boxing ring is itself nothing but a curriculum vitae, an arena to showcase your skill sets.<br/><br/>The film ends with Mickey ""retraining"" for this new world, his manhood/masculinity reprogrammed and reconstituted. After cutting ties with his brother and his selfish, wholly dysfunctional extended family, he eventually becomes a freak like them. Final image: a VHS shot (and then a VHS shot of the VHS shot) of Mickey and Dicky side by side, equally flat, one brother a nut case, the other now on his way to becoming one.<br/><br/>Eventually Bale's super self-conscious performance unintentionally begins to work as subtext. Bale's identity is unstable, depth-less and thoroughly postmodern. Whalberg, meanwhile, is a devout Christian and supremely (and naively) self assured in what and who he is. What this new wave of modern ""boxing films"" seems to unconsciously stress is not the physical damage induced by fists on flesh, the seeping of blood or the swelling of faces, but a kind of cruel alienation which the boxer must adopt if he is to triumph; to win you must sell yourself, stop being yourself, change who you are and acknowledge, indeed, that there is no self; you do not belong to ""you"". And this triumph is always hollow. Rocky was reborn a man, a hero, when he took down Apollo Creed, but Mickey and Randy the Ram become flat images, selling their new bodies to the media-space and then discarded.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this was a work for hire for director David O. Russell. The project's real auteur is Mark Wahlberg. Aronofsky himself rejected the script in favour for directing ""The Wrestler"".<br/><br/>7/10 – Like watching every boxing cliché spat out of a blender and then steamrolled flat."
"JohnRayPeterson","9","1","2","24 March 2011"," Not just another boxing related movie, not by a long shot.
","It is not a coincidence that this movie has as many nominations and awards to its credit as it does; I was impressed when I looked it up. I knew only the Oscar and Golden Globes related ones. Also not surprising are the highest of ratings from both critics and movie goers/lovers alike, from all the sources I looked up. It is expected IF you've seen the movie. You'll know for sure once you've seen it twice. Let me repeat thatOnce you've seen it twice. This is the typical movie that you will eventually and knowingly watch twice, like the Godfather, like Scarface, like The Departed, like Sideways, like you get my drift. <br/><br/>Why? It's not Rocky (the original one only) and it's not Raging Bull, nor is it Requiem for a Heavyweight, surely the best casted boxing movie if you know your facts. It is not one of these acclaimed movies; it is the acclaimed seven times nominated and twice 2011 Oscar winner The Fighter. Okay that still does not answer the question 'why', I know.<br/><br/>Well to start with, the producer and lead actor Mark Wahlberg picked or was lucky to get David Russell with whom he worked previously on a couple of not too shabby movies, 'I Heart The Huckabees' and 'The Three Kings'. That would have to be a pretty good starting point, if you were taking on a property like 'The Fighter'. Actually, I looked up the rating of Wahlberg's productions and there are more than you probably expect, in addition to which they all are top rated. A 'just for instance' is warranted here; Boardwalk Empire is a recent production by Wahlberg. Check IMDb's filmography by rating and you'll understand. I don't necessarily agree with all the ratings but I'm not a critic. This popular actor is popular for a reason; a scroll of his roles in the selection of movies he's acted in speak for themselves. He delivers steadily good performances in a variety of characters; the roles and his delivery of them are, if not tops, certainly ones that stand out each and every time. If you have seen many of his movies, you know that upon reflection; you probably have not thought of him in the context of body of work of an artist but if you do, you may realize this is one smart movie guy. I guess you could say with no risk of being wrong, that he knows what people are going to like.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent and delivered outstanding performances for which the Oscar wins confirm what so many other reviews have raved about. Christian Bale, like him or not for whatever your reasons, has taken on some of the toughest roles around and some of the more 'out there' characters; he would not have been offered those roles if he did not have the talent directors were looking for. This was the case here. I was blown away, like so many, by the performance of Melissa Leo. Amy Adams I've liked for quite some time and was very happy she had the part of Charlene in this movie; it made me like it even more.<br/><br/>I don't wish to spoil your movie watching experience if you haven't yet gone to see the movie, so I'll chose my words carefully now. The story is original and depicts real people, flawed but not that you'd hate them, warm but not that you'd make friends right off the bat ( at least I wouldn't), caring and well intended people, which the acting and directing made us happily discover is not something only in good books. The movie also treats boxing as just another tough sport to make a living from; there were no big heroes, just ordinary people overcoming steep odds and warranting exactly what is said in the very last scene. I liked the last few words very much. This movie has a happy ending which thankfully is not fairytale like; just an ending that leaves you with a warm and fuzzy as well as an urgent need to tell all your friends to watch it."
"hassan-ilahi","9","1","2","19 March 2011"," Wahlberg's big project exceeds thoroughly.
","Mark Wahlberg was never an acclaimed actor. Yes, he was brilliant in 'The Departed' and 'Boogie Nights', but otherwise he came in garbage films like 'Max Payne'. So, you can tell that he wanted the 'recognition' from the world and was a bit desperate to get a great script working. He came up with this film and thoroughly blew me away.<br/><br/>'The Fighter' features captivating performances from Wahlberg, Bale, and Adams; and also captures the raw intensity of dysfunctional families and neighborhoods. David O. Russell makes an impressive turn with this film and leaves me mesmerized.<br/><br/>The performances are captivating and powerful. Mark Wahlberg is highly focused as the main character of the film and keeps the show going. Christian Bale gives the probable best performance you'll see from him yet. Amy Adams is ferocious and aggressive (not afraid to take a stand). Supporting cast is fine too; Melissa Leo makes a surprising turn as the mother. She is arrogant, humorous, and near-perfect.<br/><br/>The storyline is great and enough to keep you glued to the screen. Focusing on the certain culture and on-goings of a dysfunctional family are interesting, (if not thoughtful). The direction is also great, but not anything outstanding like the performances. Russell does a damn well job.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is truly watchable and exceptionally one of the best films this year. The performances are highly appraisal; Wahlberg, Bale, and Adams deserve recognition from the harsh Academy. Just hope that the Academy don't make a stupid mistake."
"ElMaruecan82","7","1","2","13 March 2011"," A good sports drama that pales in comparison with ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" ...
","""The Fighter"" had everything to be a Knock-Out. Something about the kind of resurrection's stories that only cinema can powerfully tell. Something about self-confidence, determination and courage, making us identify with characters that incarnate this eternal struggle of human spirit, in order to triumph over the adversity ... thanks to a total physical and spiritual dedication. And which movie genre is more inspiring than Sports in that specific case? However, sports dramas is also a genre that can be considered a double edged sword when poorly executed, and inevitably falling into some clichés, the kind that ruined the classic ""Rocky"" or provided movies ranked in the same category than purely entertaining action-driven flicks, looking more like flashy ads for video games or sports wear than films with real substance. And this is why only a handful of sports film had the honor to be nominated for Best Picture, and that most of them are about boxing.<br/><br/>The particularity of Boxing movies and what makes them so inspiring is probably the fact that beyond the limits of the ring and the silver screen, this is the closest sport to define the very concept of life. If you consider your life as ring, you have the adversity, you must fight it, you hit, you're being hit, and at the end, either you stand, either you're in the floor, and in between, it's just you letting all your strength and everything that could fill your body with anger and frustration going out or all the motivation and confidence that could pump your heart and fill your veins with the appetite for winning, for proving yourself, for the ultimate triumph  boxing is about a self-destruction before the victory, about paying the biggest price to overcome the inner enemy that tries to knock you down, about getting beaten, getting ugly and finally getting the victory  or losing again, but it's never a victory in the ring, it's about fighting your own demons. And now that I think of it, the greatest boxing movies, which were regarded among the best sports films, were hardly about winning in the ring. This is not how I remember ""Rocky"", ""Raging Bull"" or ""Million Dollar Baby"" anyway  and if I mention these three films, I guess it's because I believe ""The Fighter"" is a good film, but which pales in comparison with its glorious predecessors.<br/><br/>I think what lacks in this film is the element that must drive sports dramas: passion. Never in this film, had this passion been communicated, not through the lead character anyway: Micky Ward, played by Mark Whalberg. Micky is probably one of the most passive lead characters, in the worst way, the one that makes impossible to feel any empathy for him, sometimes sympathy, but most of the times, it rhymed with pity. Seriously, even though it's based on a true story, when he's not influenced by his bossy foul-mouthed mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, and his ex-champion, crack-addicted, dim-witted half-brother, portrayed by an excellent Christian Bale, it's his girlfriend Charlene that convinces him to rebel and to think of his future. He never decides on his own, he's always influenced, and we don't really care for him because the other characters steal the scene with such efficiency, especially Christian Bale, that the results of the fight don't really matter. Ironically, even the way he wins his first match seems like a lucky shot more than a calculated strategy. His victory is a hold-up, just like his life, he let himself being hit before one or two deadly shots. The film lacks transitions : the kind that would have explained what Charlene found in Mickey to kiss him so tenderly after her boring date in the theater? Well, at least, it made us admire her sexy body early in the film, but I still prefer Rocky and Adrian's romance.<br/><br/>It's a pity because it's such a dynamic film, driven by good performances. Unfortunately, the writing, pacing and directing didn't really match this quality. Too much arguing and shouting: at one point, the movie becomes a real mess that doesn't let you enough time to know the characters and understand their motives. Why is the mother so over-protective? How did Dicky become drug-addicted? What about this TV documentary? How did Dicky and Alice finally get along? Did they just decide to make peace and then it cuts directly to the final match, what happened between? Is what all Mickey needed from the beginning the right words between two rounds? Really? It could have been done better, seriously. And don't let me start about the sisters, these loud-mouthed chicks were obviously just comic reliefs and made the whole thing particularly laughable. But it could have been forgivable if we got to know the most important character, Micky. He seemed like a nice and obedient guy with a potential, with heart as they say, but at the end, he didn't change that much. And that's what disqualifies this film as a sports drama, when in general, it's more about a victory that goes beyond the arena, when ironically, those who don't win the game are the ultimate winners, because the victory was elsewhere.<br/><br/>And despite his victory, I still had the feeling that there was something of a loser in the way Whalberg portrayed Micky, and it's no surprise that even in real life, the actor didn't get the Oscar nomination for the performance. He was the main character, and the movie sinned by not giving him too much chance to evolve, to please, to fascinate, to inspire us, it was more about evolution of situations told in a very contrived way: Micky with family, Micky rebelling, everyone reunited, and (surprise!) victory at the end. Sorry, but that victory was Dicky, Alice and Charlene's one. Micky was an outsider from beginning to end, and it's not the last shot of the film that would change my mind."

You just wanted to get up out of your seat, grab her and yell, ""YOUR SON'S ON DRUGS. DON'T YOU GET THAT? You didn't understand if it was benign neglect of both Mickey and Dickey or she was just hiding away the truth about her ""amazing"" son turned crack addict. Amy Adams, Charlena, was also very good. In the movie she plays a college drop out who drinks too much and drinks too much. She just wants to turn her if around, and she sees that in Micky.

","Action man Mark Wahlberg and actor Christian Bale play real-life boxing half-brothers 'Irish' Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund. Dicky, once a decent prospect, now trains the ageing Micky, but has fallen into a grim world of drugs and debauchery. He clings on pitifully to his one, probably apocryphal boast, that he knocked down 'Sugar' Ray Leonard. Under pressure from his feuding family, Micky is experiencing a losing streak and wonders whether his heart is still in it.<br/><br/>Credit to both men for how they immerse themselves in their roles. Wahlberg exercised for several years – because filming dates kept being postponed – and has come out as muscled as a Belgian Blue bull. Bale shed much weight, which he does so easily, and adopts a slurring, simpering diction to portray his baleful character.<br/><br/>There's no triumphalism, which came as a surprise, no hair-raising anthem and no excessive scenes of impossible training manoeuvres. Director David O'Russell went for the low-key approach, using light and dark humour to full, sometimes over-, effect.<br/><br/>Even though it may have been true to life, domestic scenes are over the top. Likewise, I found it odd that one minute Dicky was drugged up, delaying Micky's training and the next he was lucid, literally running back to his brother. Films as entertainments aren't supposed to retell real stories verbatim: making a documentary was always an option. The boxing scenes, however, are masterly. Not an exaggeration: I actually noticed myself move to dodge hooks and escape uppercuts. <br/><br/>Welshman (though he prefers the term 'Londoner') Christian Bale is one main reason why I go to the movies. Not yet 40, he has given powerhouse performances in 'American Psycho', 'The Machinist', 'Harsh Times' and 'Rescue Dawn'. And that's without mentioning he is Batman. His misfortune is that he near kills himself to prepare for films unworthy of his efforts. Sadly, 'The Fighter' again shows him to be in a class above everyone else in what is another pedestrian story.<br/><br/>Whilst this film goes some way to reassure us that the boxing genre isn't quite defunct, it doesn't match the power of the first two 'Rocky' films, or the schmaltzy charm of Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man'. It's somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>www.scottishreview.net"

Now back to the original argument does the Ex-rapper / boy band singer deserve an Oscar that being marky mark from new kids on the block.

","The Fighter is a 2010 biographical sports film directed by David O. Russell, and starring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Amy Adams. The film centers on the life of professional boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and his older half-brother Dicky Eklund (Bale). Amy Adams co- stars as a love interest of Ward (Wikipedia, because am lazy i cant spell actors names and also I cant remember characters names).<br/><br/>This is a film that mixes both the typical Rocky underdog sports movie with an interesting look at dysfunctional family life. It centres on Irish Micky Wards trials and tribulation as struggling professional fighter trying to cut in a world where his brother over shadows him both in persona and notoriety. Dicky who had gained his 15 minutes of fame for knocking down Sugar Ray Lenard (think I have spelt that right) looms large over Micky like impeding potato famine. For me the films strongest points are watching the family tear its self apart through greed and pride as it implodes under the weight of its own pressure. The family which resembles a gang of pikeys from snatch are all at the bottom end of society and see mickeys possible success as an escape from there mega existence. Micky finds love and with it the strength to stand up to his family's incessant demands, not in some convoluted Disney sense but some sort of fighting back against his mother whipped, brother whipped trainer whipped arse. The pussy actually sets him free. <br/><br/>There are some excellent performances here, Christian Bail best in my opinion. He plays a balding crack head to perfection. I know he goes to some extreme lengths for his character (the machinist) but he really looks like he's been sucking tramps off for tasty hit of crunk, even his spine seems bent and contorted. He's gone a long way to redeeming himself, I hated is constipated version of batman and the mega turkey that was Terminator Salvation. Whalbergs beefed up for the part maybe a bit too much, looks a bit chubby and sluggish in some of the fight scenes. Another thing I found with Wahlberg's character was the docility of his performance. I don't know if this can be a criticism of Wahlberg because this could be a character trait and also the feeling of hopelessness and frustration of his trappings, he could have done with some of the crack is brother smoking to help him emote more. It sounds like a negative review but other than Wahlberg being a bit chubby and lacklustre it really is excellent film with strong script and supporting cast. The interpersonal relationships are played with some real honestly and it is worth watching as an examination of a lower class immigrant family struggling in the American dream. This is where the film stands up and is not the typical clichéd believe in yourself sports story normally associated with this type of film."
"jamesdavidhead","8","1","2","23 January 2011"," Great film
","Great profile of the boxer Micky Wards life. The story also concentrates hard on his brother Dicky Eklund, an ex boxing/junkie/Micky's trainer. Mark Walberg is excellent as the under achieving boxer who's dominated by his brother, who has hero status in the neighbourhood for his contentious knockdown of Sugar Ray Leonard in the 80's, and his domineering mother/manager. Christian Bale surpasses Wahlbergs performance as brother Dicky. Dicky is trying to make a come back in boxing and train his younger brother whilst battling Crack addiction and fighting his own demons.<br/><br/>Some of the boxing scenes are a bit 'too Rocky' for me but this is much more than a boxing film. It deals with complex family relationships and it could almost be said that the main focus of the film is on Crack addiction and how it destroys lives. The fight for the WBU title at the end is a bit overplayed but Hollywood does need a big climax. Overall though great and believable film. Some 'based on true events' films deviate too much from the truth and thus become un-believable but i think The Fighter gets the balance just about right."

","A 'stepping stone' boxer (Wahlberg) must step out of the shadow of his controlling lower socio-economic family whose influence threaten to squander his talents before he can prove to the world that he's a true contender. His older brother and mentor (Bale) is a crack-addict and former boxer who famously knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in his only memorable bout some dozen years earlier; unfortunately, it's his erratic criminal behaviour that hinder Wahlberg's ascendance to the achievements his brother never attained.<br/><br/>Marky Mark shows us again why he's a contender in the thespian lounge, not overshadowed by Bale's tormented soul, a minor hero in his working class community, now ravaged by crack addiction. Adams (as Wahlberg's feisty girlfriend) is a revelation - and despite her age (36 at the time), she has the looks and figure of someone ten years younger (can I say wow?). Lucky guy indeed to have her in his corner. Leo and McGee are also notable as Micky's step mom and dad each with their own brand of support for their respective children (a colourful brood).<br/><br/>The focus on the effects of drug addiction dwarfs any ugliness that is inherent in the boxing industry; the lifestyle and its 'trappings' are depicted as anything but glamorous. Desperately sad at times, there are moments of humour, suspense and acute violence and the overall result is both satisfying and resonating (soundtrack too earns marks; particularly Whitesnake and Hall & Oates). Bale would surely attract award notice for his portrayal of an endearing, yet painfully tragic figure who despite talent and potential, found only failure in his success. His brother's triumph is his chance at redemption, and most who see this film would surely be in his corner. Highly recommended."

His family had me laughing the way they acted.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a must see! I'm kinda glad I didn't know the history of these fighters because then I would have known the end.

","I don't know why I keep doing this to myself. I love good movies but man oh man I cannot watch a boxing movie without flinching. The fighter is a good underdog movie. The thing that makes it a bit different is the fact that the hero Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) isn't the cause of his troubles; it's his love and devotion to his family and crack addicted Brother Dickey.<br/><br/>Dickey played by Christian Bale was heartbreakingly believable. The sad reality is that many people suffer from the same type of addiction that can slowly kill him, his family and his dreams. It is a hard look at how a person handles life after their moment in the spotlight has passed. It showed how difficult it is to live in the present and pass on your unfulfilled dreams to another. It takes a strong person to take hold of the what is truly ahead of them and put someone else's needs center stage.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this movie are brutal. I can watch martial arts and sci fi shoot em' ups but when it comes to this type of one on one brawling, its difficult to watch. Mark Wahlberg stated he trained for a year to prepare for this movie. He didn't disappoint, every match looked real (as much as I could watch that is). But the fighting was not limited to the ring. The rowdy bunch Mickey Ward calls family had plenty of action outside the ring as well. Wow, this is a tough group of folk.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg is well on his way to being very Stephen King like in the way that he highlights hometown stories. Stephen King is synonymous with Maine as it looks like Mark Wahlberg will be with Massachusettes. But hey, every town has a story to tell, why not MA.<br/><br/>www.rivareviews.com"

","This is more than a boxing movie, it's a depiction of life in the blue-collar slums. Bale performance is an actor defining performance; I was actuated by emotion afterwards, It gripped me like no other movie in recent years. The prison scene where they aired the HBO documentary on Dick's life as an addict was heart-wrenching. And the actual fight scenes packed one hell of a punch. It deserves to be right up there with the best movies of the decade. My single gripe with the movie was Wahlberg's acting. He was ice to Bale's fire. Wahlberg's acting is decent but not outstanding. As a boxing fan I've seen Dicky fight, and Bale in that two hours was Dicky Eklund. Check out lost lives in Lowell and you'll understand what I mean. All in all, a ""must see"" for boxing and movie fan alike."

","Just got back from witnessing an amazing film in a time that often does not happen. The Fighter delivered everything i expected from this film and MORE! I am a very big Christian Bale fan and after The Fighter i am an even bigger one. This is by far the best acting i have seen from him in his career. Mark Wahlberg is on top of his game as well. Everyone in this film, even the characters i grew to hate throughout (the MOM lol) were terrific. Another star that shot out at me was Amy Adams. I am used to seeing her as the lovable princess in Disneys Enchanted but she basically plays the opposite in this role and does an amazing job at it. Kudos to everyone that were apart of this film. It is such an uplifting and inspirational story. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
"blacklist-1","6","2","7","9 February 2011"," The Fighter is a good boxing drama, but it fails to deliver a hefty punch. Overrated and over-hyped. A giant disappointment.
","I was really looking forward to The Fighter after the hype shown on here with most of the ratings being eight, nine and ten and 8.2 overall, plus also the critics praising it comparing to be like Rocky etc and that Christian Bale deserves an Oscar for best actor or whatever and thought it would ring true sadly it did not.<br/><br/>I knew the story was formulaic and cliché with the exact same structure as Rocky making it predictable, that wasn't the problem. My problem the film fails to be inspirational or have much heart and emotion like Rocky. Many of the characters are remotely unlikeable like Alice Ward, the mother (Mellisa Leo), but the biggest problem of this movie was Micky's (Mark Wahlberg) brother 'Dickie' (Christian Bale) who is a selfish crack-head and dosen't really redeem himself much, only a little in the last half hour. You don't really come to care about him as result as he treats his brother like crap (just like his mum) and dosen't care about his little son. Also there is little depth or characterisation to the characters like we never find out what motivated Dickie to become involved in violence and drugs so they just seem one-dimensional including Walhberg's character Micky. Part of me not liking this film as much as others like Rocky is Dickie being unlikeable but this is based on a true story, so the character is accurately portrayed and director David Russel dosen't pretend otherwise. My problem is that Bale is completely the wrong actor for this role, which makes his performance I'm afraid terrible and one of his worst and nowhere near worthy of an Oscar. He isn't a bad actor as I liked him in Equilibrium, Batman Begins, The Machinist and Terminator Salvation (though not The Dark Knight). But he just didn't fit into the role for me and looked like a young boy who wears his father's clothes and it's too big for him. As a result his character comes across as childish in that result and instead of goofy charming is goofy idiot and annoying. Another problem is the script which is bad (just like in Rocky), but the actors used it and managed to make it seem meaningful, like Stallone with his gruff charm and facial expressions. Bale pretty much keeps the same throughout and even Walhberg wasn't good at first and sounded dull at certain points.<br/><br/>Furthermore though the boxing fights are competently shot and choreographed, it's quite mediocre really with little excitement,spirit or inspiration unlike in Rocky or Raging Bull where you really cheer for the main character and want him to win. The Fighter has the opposite effect. <br/><br/>However Melissa Leo gives a good performance as Micky's mum, Walhberg improves as the film goes and adapts himself to the script and puts more effort into how he projects his dialogue, which makes his acting worthy by the end. But the best performance is Micky's girlfriend Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) who is terrific and gives a honest and believable performance lending her character substance and depth which the others sadly lack. Also I like that she stuck by Micky throughout unlike his so called family and actually punches one of Angie's dim-witted sisters (that was a classic moment). I also enjoyed the music and it was well shot and edited.<br/><br/>It did start out terrible but it got better and it entertained me enough, but it's been well over-hyped with a lot of people duped into believing it is as great as Rocky. I'm afraid it reaches nowhere near and if Bale does get the Oscar, it would be criminal as it deserves to go to other actors I've seen who have been far more exceptional than him. 2011 has been a amazing year of films for me up till now and The Fighter is the worst I've seen so far (of the previous seven I've seen), but it won't remain the worst. It's just it's the first film this year I've been disappointed by. It's worth seeing and it entertains with a couple of great performances but it's easily forgettable and not worth seeing at the pictures, only renting on DVD. A great disappointment as it had the potential to be so much more."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","7","26 January 2011"," One of 2010's Most Powerful Films
","Fighter, The (2010) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg turns in the performance of a lifetime as Micky Ward, a boxer who can't seem to fight his way to the top, which could be the fault of his manager mother (Melissa Leo) and his crackhead brother (Christian Bale). Micky is constantly doing what's best for those around him instead of doing what's best for himself but this starts to change when a new woman (Amy Adams) enters his life. Boxing films have been around since the 1890s when the likes of Edison would film entire fights and then sell them to the public round by round. Since these earliest days you've had a wide range of actors play boxers and whenever a new movie comes along that deals with a boxer you can almost place bets on how the story is going to play out. It's funny but the boxing sub-genre really hasn't changed too much from the silent days to CHAMPION to RAGING BULL and to more recent stuff like MILLION DOLLAR BABY. I think unlike other sport films, boxing lets you root for people who you normally wouldn't care a bit about. I've read reviews that stated Micky Ward had no personality and I think this is true because his personality was trying to keep everyone else out of trouble, which is why he often found himself in trouble and to me this is the entire point of THE FIGHTER. There's no question this film offers up some of the best acting of the year but it also has some of the most powerful moments as well. This certainly isn't the greatest movie of the year but there's no question that it's a major success for its cast and director. Wahlberg has always been capable of strong performances when the material was right and this one here is without question a masterpiece. Wahlberg's Ward doesn't get a very flashy part and he really isn't given the best dialogue of the film. Often times he's in the background watching all the chaos of his family in front of him and this is the reason the performance is so great because he reacts to everything going on. I always say the greatest thing about some performances are the eyes and watching Wahlberg react here is worth the price of admission. The flashiest role certainly goes to Bale who is rightfully winning just about every award. We've seen crackheads before but not once here did you ever see an actor because Bale is so in character that you can't help but feel as if you're watching a real documentary on a troubled person. Leo turns in another great performance after her work in FROZEN RIVER and Adams is also impressive once again and she's clearly turning out to be one of the finest workers currently in Hollywood. Jack McGee is also worth mentioning as the father. I think at times the soundtrack is over used and some of the editing during the fights tries to be too stylish but there's no denying that the power of this film is in its story and acting. One of the most heartbreaking and brutally raw moments in recent memory comes during a scene where HBO is showing a documentary on Micky's brother. Seeing how this impacts everyone in this family was certainly the most powerful moment of any film released in 2010."

","Wow. Do I have to mention to my reader(s) or friends or peers that I am not a sports fan, let alone boxing fan?<br/><br/>YetI LOVED the following: Million Dollar Baby, Rocky (yeah, including part VI) and even Diggstown. Does Fight Club count? Or The Wrestler, even though it's technically not about boxing?<br/><br/>But I didn't love The Fighter. Sure it was genuine in its surroundings and characters (SEE: Winter's Bone) and those, I believe, drove the movie to better than average (for most – me, just to average.) Like the mother, Melissa Leo as Alice Ward. She was great. Or the brother, Dicky (Bale) who was also a phenomenal creation.<br/><br/>Beyond the wonderfully thought out characters and actors, I was literally bored for most of the sports scenes. Even the workout shots. With the exception of the finale that absolutely didn't let you know one way or the other on how this will pan out.<br/><br/>The story goes: aging no-ambition boxer Micky's (Wahlberg) trying for a comeback with the aid of his rednecked mother/manager Alice and druggie older brother, Dicky. When they continue to bring him down, he (RIGHTFULLY) turns to outsourcing and does, in fact, start an upward climb in the ring.<br/><br/>Naturallymeaning, no spoiler here – it is based on a true story, as alwayshe can't leave his family back, no matter how bad they are. So they regroup and things go as you might expect. Well, except for the finale.<br/><br/>Honestly, I wasn't impressed in the overall product. Sure, it's well made. Leo did a great job and some are stating so did Bale. He did, and probably will win (FINALLY!) the Oscar. But to me, throughout, it was basic and by the numbers with no heartfelt moments. Nothing like when I watched Million Dollar Baby or Rocky. I can't even see past the blah film to credit such fine performances. Even the music was mismatched with the scenes.<br/><br/>Finally, it's not necessary a movie to skip this Oscar season. But, it's not gonna rock any boats. It's simply just a movie to see. You won't take anything from it, unless you're marking it off your list of Best Picture nominations to see before the big night. And if Bale wins, kudos to him. I just wish he won for something more deserving, such as American Psycho or The Machinist when the Oscars were used to snubbing him. In fact, if they give it to him in pity, as they do, I'll be ashamed I actually watched such sell outs."
"Troy_Campbell","6","2","9","18 January 2011"," More a collection of fine individual efforts than a spellbinding biopic.
","It's difficult to decide how good The Fighter really is. On one hand you have impressive acting by the stars – the leading male duo along with Leo and Adams in support – and a worthy rags-to-riches tale with a rousing sport at the centre of it. The direction of David O. Russell is slightly quirky but commendable whilst the score is suitably strong. The boxing scenes don't pack the same punch as say Raging Bull or Hurricane, however they're hard-hitting enough to excite and the cheesy training montages are thankfully kept to a minimum. All boxes appear to be checked, so what's my issue? Well, it lacks power.<br/><br/>It's clear from the history of boxing movies that this is meant to be stirring. Have you ever seen a boxing flick that was anything other than a drama? I can't recall one. Perhaps this is the issue. The cast and crew strive to earn the film the gravitas it so clearly wants to attain, though somewhere along the way they forget that a bit of light-heartedness is essential to achieving this. Instead, the level of seriousness pitched throughout weighs the picture down to a point that I felt like it was more of a chore to journey with Mickey to his inevitable greatness, rather than a heartfelt passion.<br/><br/>As standalone elements, the performances are undeniably solid. Whalberg has needed a career boost for a few years and this, along with his jocular turn in The Other Guys, has put him back on the right path. He embodies the mentality of a down-and-out pugilist with a natural likeness, and his days as a male model clearly helped in ensuring his physicality was spot on. As the unreliable and seriously troubled Dickie Eklund – Mickey's older step-brother and long time idol – Bale will no doubt gain the majority of the critical acclaim, what with his weight-drop, hair-thinning and drug-addled portrayal, but ironically it is his character that is lacking in interest the most.<br/><br/>More a collection of fine individual efforts than the spellbinding biopic it should've been, although it's great to see Whalberg hitting his stride again.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)"
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","3","14 July 2013"," Pretty good little biopic
","Not an amazing film or anything, but a thought-provoking human drama that envelops you in detailed, character-led storytelling. In essence, the writers got hold of an interesting true-life tale about two boxing brothers and turned it into one of those documentary-looking films in the same style as THE WRESTLER.<br/><br/>The cast are fine. Mark Wahlberg has, I think, realised by now that he will never be one of the acting greats, but he contributes a leading role here which is all heart. He's a good guy to get behind. Christian Bale, of course, is the scene-stealer as the heroin addicted brother, but then having seen plenty of his work I wouldn't really expect anything else from him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is populated by irritating characters yet the conflict rings true and the character arcs are well drawn. I'm not really a huge fan of David O. Russell as director but he does an admirable job here, both in the character drama and the electrifying boxing scenes. THE FIGHTER certainly has enough going for it to hold the attention and proves a refreshing change from the onslaught of superhero flicks clogging up local cinema screens."
"wandereramor","6","1","3","10 January 2013"," Coulda been a contender
","We shouldn't really be surprised by roughness in a boxing movie anymore, but in The Fighter David O. Russel presents us with an image of poverty and desperation that feels much more stark -- and, importantly, much more contemporary -- than the ghettoes of Raging Bull or the working-class district of Rocky. This feels like a working-class film too, unashamedly putting narrative before aesthetics and emotion before intellect.<br/><br/>That narrative is nothing extraordinary -- it fits pretty comfortably into the standard sports movie archetype, in which the growth of character is directly parallelled by a growth in athletic success. There's a kind of simplistic and sentimental ring to the script, which seems too quick to cast moral judgement on its characters The performances are also not as good as you've heard. Melissa Leo is admittedly good, burying her usual hardness beneath an outsized overbearing mother, although there are times when she comes off as a cartoon. Amy Adams is forgettable, Christian Bale is gimmicky, and Mark Wahlberg is about what you would expect. The setting is the real star, no matter how many Oscar statuettes the humans involved can muster.<br/><br/>Still, for all its flaws The Fighter has a good heart, and is at the very least the kind of solid drama you can respectably fritter away some time with. As a boxing quasi-fan, I would have liked Ward's fights with Gatti to be more than a footnote, but I understand that the focus of the film was on his struggles to reach that level. And it meets that goal fairly well, resulting in an entertaining if not particularly deep film."

","The Fighter is a biographic movie about Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund and their quests. The plural because there are two intertwined stories, Ward's ambition to become a champion fighter and Eklund's fight to end his addiction and find his feet. Ward's boxing career is the center of it all, with its several bumps and turns along the way.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing, but never really caught me until late in the movie. Perhaps because there were too much focus on the bumps in the beginning, almost exclusively, so the story didn't get any flow until later on. Perhaps it is because the stellar acting, foremost by Bale as Dickey, that made this rather tragic and unnerving story too real.<br/><br/>The real entertainment is the acting. Mark Wahlberg is good, real good, but it is Bale that steals the show completely and he got an Oscar for it. Melissa Leo also got one for her character Alice, Micky's mother, and they're supported by Amy Adams and Jack McGee among others.<br/><br/>All in all a good movie with a good albeit unsurprising ending.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ddude1116","3","1","3","30 March 2012"," The Awkward Child of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky""
","For a film about a champion boxer, Mickey Ward, the boxer in question, is the weakest character in the entire film. It is the supporting cast who hold this film up on two legs, and it's ninety minutes of them bickering and thirty minutes of anything else happening. This film is horrifically unambitious, taking the actual story, and molding it over the forms set forth by ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"" before it. Sports movies have a fairly general array of stories, but ""Rocky"" did it best for a boxing film. ""Raging Bull"" is less boxing film and more biopic, focusing on a general set of points regarding one's life, and it set the standard. ""The Fighter"" is half-and-half. Its story is that of a boxing film, but its focus is on its characters, except Mickey Ward, whom I thought was the main focus of the film. So you sit through two hours of Christian Bale smoking crack and Amy Adams and Melissa Leo fighting, and that's it. Then there's a brief training montage and WHOO!! Mickey Ward won the Welterweight Title. Awesome. Too bad the filmmakers neglected every step it took to actual make him an empathetic character. Come on, David O Russell, his childhood was probably relevant. Show him growing up, being put down, how he developed into the sad sack he became, because it is so much more relevant to Mickey Ward, for he lacks the emotional issues of Jake La Motta and the approachable earnestness of Rocky Balboa. I don't care if his BROTHER was a crack addict or his MOTHER was a nightmarish fiend of a woman, what I care about, or want to care about, is HIM."

Micky, played by Mark Walhberg, seems to have all the heart in the world but doesn't always find himself in the best situations. Micky finds himself being hindered on many occasions by his overbearing family. The plot starts with his mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, as his uneducated manager, while his brother Dicky works as his co-trainer. Dicky, played by Christian Bale, had a glimpse of hope as boxer when he knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. Dicky seems to never move from this time in his life, and in turn he has nothing going for him besides an HBO series that documents his drug abuse.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the flow of the movie because it seemed to speed up when necessary and consequently slow down at times when the characters were moving fast. Also, I felt like the audience was always able to keep up with the plot, while not hard to follow, but also very volatile at times.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the making of this film is the sound. Whether it's the fights between the families or the actual boxing fights, you felt like you were right there ringside. The audience could hear the sounds of the glove hitting the face and you could feel the blood leave his nose. The emotions played a huge role in setting up the characters in this movie. You had to feel bad for Micky, as he tried so hard to do what's best and always seemed to fall harder than before.<br/><br/>One thing I thought was strange was how long it took for the plot to expose Dicky's drug addiction. It wasn't until he was arrested that it became clearly apparent that he was living out of a drug house. I wish the director would've put more emphasis on this subject because it truly was a huge piece to the movie. After viewing the awards for the movie, I feel Charlene, played by Amy Adams, should've received more attention. I think she played a phenomenal role, particularly where she stood up to Alice and when she fought with Micky's sisters.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie had a great storyline, and it played on every emotion the audience had. There were points you laughed, sometimes you grimaced, and most of all you felt compassion, not only for Micky but for his entire family."

","USA has a great tradition when it comes to boxing movies and the masterpieces are of course ""Fat City"" and ""Raging Bull"". But somehow the same story is being told all the time. It's about the beaten-up fighter who starts his race upwards, but that wouldn't have been possible without his trainer and his family/wife and besides he's a nice man and...<br/><br/>Well, we know that story and here it's being told once again. But Christian Bale is brilliant as the brother/trainer with crack problems. Mark Wahlberg is the fighter hero and he's never been a man of big gestures. It functions here too.<br/><br/>But we are absolutely not surprised in any way and the fighting scenes are certainly not realistic."
"platinumpyrrs","6","1","3","19 March 2011"," enjoyable to watch, feelgoody, punchless, fare
","Loosely based on the true story of Micky Ward, this movie ignores the genuine toughness, mental and physical strength, and immense perseverance necessary to become a champion boxer. Instead, it focuses on the family drama surrounding the fighter, as he endeavors to become his own person and emerge from the shadow of his older brother, himself a noted fighter.<br/><br/>The actors do nothing extraordinary: Melissa Leo renders her standard blue-collar, momma grizzly, Christian Bale essentially mimics the real-life Dick Eklund, and Mark Wahlberg plays himself, as usual, with his casual and likable reserve. The movie is missing what Micky Ward actually had, a punch. It portrays a triumph, without showing the real sacrifices -- physical pain, gruelling training -- necessary to get there. It feels unearned, and fake, and a discredit to Mr. Ward and any other champion.<br/><br/>A redeeming feature of the film, however, is that it reminds me of another that could be considered similar, but which is much more representative of reality in and outside the ring. That movie is ""The Wrestler."" Not based on a real life story, the lead actor there is able to create a memorable character which is a tribute to the craft of screen acting, and also to the American spirit. That film I recommend highly. You'll remember it. This one: you'll just feel good without wondering why."

Christian Bale..turning out to be an actor who can just perfectly play any role he gets..whether it is the role of Batman,Psycho,terminator or a drug addict..he just fits in.Bale's acting as a restless addict in the movie is superbly played.Overall characters were nicely balanced.Mark Wahlberg did well in showing as a professional boxer.Anyway the best parts are still the fights.I loved the last two fights because they ended pretty quick.Usually you already know that the actor after getting beaten to death will get back all his motivational energy after seeing some flash trailers of his bad past in his memory. Here it just ends..two three quick nice shots and thats it..he wins.You don't have to wait till you see the villain getting beaten to the core. A must watch for action and sports movie lovers.

It's like he is a different guy altogether.<br/><br/>This film is not Rocky, but that is good, it doesn't try to be and it doesn't need to be.

","Are the Wards/Ecklunds proud of this movie? Really? After seeing it, I do not understand why it got so much Oscar attention. The Ward/Ecklund family looks like a bunch of ignorant white trash. It looks like they don't even have the good sense to be embarrassed by this film. Whatever was great about this film, I certainly missed it. I will admit I'm not a fan of boxing in general; I watched the movie because of the awards it won. It seemed to me that the fighter spent too much time hiding behind his gloves. Mark Wahlberg lacked intensity. I agree with another reviewer who commented on the lack of character development. Maybe it should have been called ""The Fighters"" since nearly everyone in the movie was doing some fighting!"
"jboothmillard","8","2","12","6 February 2011"," The Fighter
","From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated David O. Russell (Three Kings, I Heart Huckabees), this alongside Black Swan and The King's Speech was the big award predicted film, it was also the only one I knew about rated fives stars out of five, so I went to see it. Based on the true story, this tells the story of 'Irish' Micky Ward (Golden Globe nominated Mark Wahlberg), an up and coming boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, being trained by his half-brother, former professional boxer Dicky Eklund (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Christian Bale). Dicky gave up boxing after suffering humiliating defeat against Sugar Ray Leonard, and since then he has plunged into a crack cocaine (and possibly other drugs) addiction. This is of course causes problems for the training of Micky, the welterweight wannabe champion trying to find a good fight with the help of his mother and manager Alice (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Melissa Leo). He misses out on a big fight against a competitor who becomes sick, and with quite a few losses he doesn't know where he is going yet, but he at least has a good social life gaining a new girlfriend in bar worker Charlene Fleming (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Amy Adams). Dicky is eventually caught and imprisoned for his drug use, with his drug life turned into an BO documentary, and while he is there Micky may be turning a corner with finding the right fights. Slowly he is beating his opponents with training advice given by his new trainer, and rising as a new up and coming boxer, and when Dicky is released he tries to reconcile with many people. Finally with such a high amount of wins and a great reputation as a successful professional boxer, Micky gains the big Title fight in London against an unbeaten champion, and in the end, of course he wins. Also starring Jack McGee as George Ward, Miguel Espino as Alfonso Sanchez, Peter Cunningham as Mike 'Machine Gun' Mungin, Anthony Molinari as Shea Neary, Anthony 'Ace' Thomas as Castillo, Mickey O'Keefe and the real Micky and Dicky. Bale is fantastic in his award winning performance, I am surprised Whalberg wasn't nominated the Oscar as well, Adams as always is reliable and likable, and Leo (the first Oscar winner to say the ""F"" word live) is pretty good too, if you want a real life boxing film which feels like Rocky, then you can't go wrong with this terrific biographical boxing drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","4","25 March 2011"," Everyone gives a top notch performance . . . except Wahlberg
","The Fighter is a boxing movie and family drama in which the central mistake it that it focuses on the wrong family member. Here is the story – based on true events – about ""Irish Mickey"" Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a welter-weight boxer who is working to pick up a boxing career where his brother left off.<br/><br/>His brother is Dickey (Christian Bale), who was once on his way, got far enough to step in the ring with Sugar Ray Leonard and allegedly knock him down. Now, years later, Dickey is a crackhead and miscreant who is always in and out of trouble. You tell me which one sounds more interesting.<br/><br/>Mickey's family is over-sized. Aside from brother Dickey, there is his mother Alice (Melissa Leo), a domineering figure who smokes so many cigarettes it is almost an afterthought. Her noisy house – which also include seven scary looking daughters - is filled with endless chatter. Everyone talks at once at a volume that threatens to bust the windows. It is no wonder Mickey seems shy and withdrawn.<br/><br/>That's also my problem. Mickey doesn't seem to come from this family. The rest of the family looks weathered and beaten down by life. They are noisy, loud, boisterous and opinionated while Mickey is pretty and clean. He seems like a neighbor who has come to visit. His story is your standard, average boxing movie all about hard training and the love of a good woman (the incomparable Amy Adams), but I was more interested in Dickey's story, about how a kid on the rise got sidelined by his own excesses. A good deal of the movie is concerned with Dickey being followed around by a film crew from HBO that have come, he thinks, to film his comeback. Really, they are focusing on his crack habit.<br/><br/>I like Mark Wahlberg. He is generally charismatic, but there isn't anything about Mickey Ward that is worth noting. I can't say that about Dickey, who is occupied by Christian Bale as if he has been in the Boston neighborhood his whole life. His face is weathered with deep lines. His body is thin, gaunt and unhealthy. His eyes are wide and his voice scratchy from a lifetime of hard living. This is a very different Christian Bale, not at all polished as he was in films like American Psycho or the recent Batman pictures.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a return for director David O. Russell who made a great comedy 14 years ago with Flirting with Disaster and a great drama with 1999's Three Kings, then dropped off the radar. He only directed one film in the last 10 years, the nugatory I Heart Huckabees. What these films have in common is that he shows his control over a large cast. He modulates a lot of characters and gives them all their own personality. The Fighter has that but I wish it has a better narrative structure. Here is a movie about a great cast of characters assembled for a substandard story.<br/><br/>**1/2 (of four)"
"suvopyne49","10","1","4","24 March 2011"," After Rocky, Raging Bull -- It's Fighter, Head, Body, Head.
","Though the trailer of the movie gave an impression of this movie being just another ""Wanna-be-Rocky"" movies, but it is, very impressively, not the case. <br/><br/>David O. Russell deserves all the plaudits heaped upon him, for his brilliance in showing success, and failure with equal calibre. Even the boxing matches are shown in a non-conventional technique ( Different from the Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali).<br/><br/>Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a low-profile alter weight boxer who struggles and strives for success. In that process, he also feels that he is getting overshadowed by his trainer brother Dicky Eklund(Christian Bale), who himself has been a legendary boxer from Lowell town. It's actually the downfall and rise of two brothers Micky and Dicky. That is the story of the movie and which is actually based on true events. But the thing, which makes this movie different from a simple sport movie, is the emotion and family bondings and the tension between the big family of Micky and Dicky.<br/><br/>Now, The performances. Well, winning the Academy Award in both the supporting actor and actress category speaks volume about the supporting cast. But first, the lead actor, Mark Wahlberg . Call it destiny or anything but I feel Walhberg got overshadowed by Christian Bale, just like his character ""Micky"". Wahlberg have done a pretty a good job .<br/><br/>And it's undoubtedly Bale's best performance . You could really feel his portrayal of Dicky, he really got into the skin of his character. Melissa Leo is equally good as the mother of more than half-a-dozen children. Her character is overbearing and she does full justice to it. Sad for Amy Adams, that after giving a great performance as Micky's sassy but caring girlfriend, she gets a little outclassed by her co-actor Leo.<br/><br/>Lastly, it's good to see the real Micky and Dicky giving a talk-to at the end. A very highly recommended movie even for the one who doesn't like sports movies."

"DonFishies","8","1","5","16 January 2011"," A good movie, but unable to become anything better
","Despite seeing The Fighter just before Christmas, I never got around to writing a review. Unlike other Oscar hopefuls that I had seen and never reviewed, I sat down more than once to write my thoughts about Mark Wahlberg's passion project more than once. Except I could never bring myself to write any words. I would just sit and look at a blank document, trying to will myself to write and instead coming up with nothing. I had enjoyed the movie, but was something deeper holding me back from writing about it? <br/><br/>The Fighter revolves around the early half of Mickey Ward's (Wahlberg) boxing career. He has always been managed by his mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and trained by his crack-addicted older brother Dickie (Christian Bale), and never looked the other way to how things could be different if he had professionals helping him out instead. But after hooking up with a local bartender named Charlene (Amy Adams), and after a rather brutal match, Ward starts to look in another direction for his future.<br/><br/>While the movie may be called The Fighter, Ward's quest for redemption and a title shot are not the focus of the film until the last act of the film. It focuses more so on Ward's rather eccentric family unit (Alice had a number of children, not all with the same fathers), and focuses rather heavily on Dickie's battle with drugs and the subsequent HBO crew making the real life documentary High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell (which is dramatized and recreated here). And while these focus points are not necessarily a bad thing, they do take away from the subject of the film, and the real story at the heart of the film. It also causes a bit of misdirection – should we care more about Mickey, who should be the main character in the film, or do we focus more on Dickie or Alice? It never seems sure of itself until the final act, and until that point is a bit too jumpy with its focus.<br/><br/>But when the film is focused and on-track, it is rather creative in its editing and how it recreates real life events. While the whole movie has a hazy, washed out look to itself, the scenes involving actual boxing matches have noticeable grain, are more beaten and scratched up. They have been modified to the point of looking like we are watching an actual taped version of the real life match. The actual audio from the matches is even spliced into the mix, giving it an even more authentic feel. Much the same goes for the portions shown of the High on Crack Street documentary, looking more and more like the actual doc would have back in the mid 1990s. The film was misframed and noticeably softer in the theatre I saw it in, but the magic of these authentic elements was too well composed to not take notice.<br/><br/>But then authenticity seems to be what director David O'Russell was striving for here. He cast actual residents of Lowell, Massachusetts in roles in the film (not unlike Ben Affleck does in his Boston-set epics). One of Mickey's actual trainers, police sergeant Mickey O'Keefe, plays himself in the film. The film was partially filmed where it actually takes place. Everything about the film's creation keeps adding up, and it could not have just been Wahlberg's passion for the project that made it stay so authentic. And because the film is so unlike O'Russell's other projects (Flirting with Disaster, Three Kings and the absolutely enigmatic and baffling I Heart Huckabees), the authenticity really stands out as something different and somewhat of a departure for the director and for a film like this. It easily could have been another Rocky or Raging Bull, but it made something of itself and brought some form of uniqueness to the genre.<br/><br/>Both Leo and Adams provide excellent performances as the two key female figures in Mickey's life. They both have just enough spunk and zest to bring these two spirited characters to life. They may yell a lot, and have more than one instance where they rant and swear at each other, but both hold their own against each other and everyone else on screen. They just have a presence that cannot be easily imitated, and no matter what emotion they are trying to bring out on-screen, you know that they are being as authentic as physically possible.<br/><br/>But they are both easily crushed by the power and magnetism of Bale. He is almost unrecognizable at first as the crack-addled Dickie, looking downright terrifying in some of his early scenes. We knew he was as method as they come from his work in films like The Machinist and Rescue Dawn, but he really puts it all on the line here. You will never once doubt his performance in any instance. You may become downright sickened because it is so realistic and horrific in how far he takes it. He is unmissable in this role, and if it does not get recognized by more than the critics' associations, than something is truly wrong with the system.<br/><br/>With that said however, it must be noted that our ""lead"" in the film is the weakest link. Wahlberg just cannot hold a candle to any of these three top form performers, and you can tell they are running circles around him. Sure, he is visibly putting in some effort, but it is not enough to even compare to how much better they are than he is. It is almost sad to note, but much like the film not focusing on his character, the camera does not seem to want to focus on the actor either. The Fighter is a good movie, but with that inherent flaw, it never seems able to make anything more for itself.<br/><br/>8/10."
"gutsy_gibbon","6","1","9","15 January 2011"," Real life story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward fails to deliver the knockout punch
","Considering that most Hollywood movies mainly involve characters and story lines in idealistic settings where everyone is rich, wealthy, well to do, this movie was interesting insofar as it formed the real life story of the boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward and showed the conditions of a lower middle class Irish household in New England and a boxer who comes from such a setting. There was another movie similar to this, released a couple of years ago, The Wrestler (2008), that showed the real conditions that are faced by some wrestlers in spite of the glamorous setting in which they are portrayed on television. It appears that some directors are beginning to see that showing the everyday conditions faced by ordinary people can be appealing to audiences. Overall, this movie had some positive points with good performances, especially by Christian Bale and its characters were well-formed, but the storyline and presentation lacked depth and one came away feeling half-disappointed with a movie that showed a lot of potential, but failed to deliver the knockout punch.<br/><br/>After reaching a low point in his career where he gets knocked out by a bigger boxer, Micky Ward (Mark Walhberg) receives encouragement from girlfriend, Charlene (Amy Adams) to get back on his feet and train with a new trainer since his previous trainer, Dicky (Christian Bale), is in jail. After this, the movie starts on the standard feel good, ""rags-to-riches"" storyline.<br/><br/>The movie also has one of the two main characters, Dicky, being videographed for a documentary about which he does not know what it is about. Being a crack addict, he is not even aware of being involved in such a documentary. His character is an interesting one insofar as it is a morality story about crack addiction, a rags to riches tale and an anti-hero, all mixed in one. Of course, talking about crack addiction cannot be considered simply as a morality tale as it is a major issue faced by millions of people in the United States and other countries. When Dicky gets caught by the cops and is about to be dragged away, the reaction shown by his half-brother, Micky, was a spontaneous one and this scene was a reminder of the situation faced by many ordinary people who have to deal with cops in one way or the other.<br/><br/>An important disappointing point about the movie were the characters of Micky's sisters, about all of whom we see nothing other than they just seem to ""hang around"" the house without doing anything. This seems strange as it is shown that their mother, who forms the character of the failing businesswoman, seems to be the only earning member of the household and that she earns around $20,000 for each fight that Micky takes part in. With such an income, we can conclude that it is not possible to support the seven sisters and they must be working too. We normally do not see such characters as the sisters shown in this movie in Hollywood movies. However in the movies of such directors as Ken Loach, we do find characters of real working women and the conditions faced by them. Though it is not mainly about them, this movie does not attempt to portray them in a good light at all, but instead they are shown mainly to be bellicose, lazy ""hangers on"".<br/><br/>After much training and encouragement from his new trainer and girlfriend, Micky goes on to win his fight with a Mexican boxer. Micky then is given an opportunity for a title fight, which he accepts. In the title fight, which takes place in London, we see that his opponent is a British boxer. In many Hollywood movies, the character of the villain is played by someone with a (many a time, faux-) British accent and we knew from the start of the fight that his opponent had to lose the fight since he had a British accent. Thus, the movie forms a standard rags to riches tale which forms one of the staple types of movies that roll out of Hollywood ever so often."

"CubsandCulture","10","0","1","26 February 2019"," What a film about boxing should be
","The story about the chaotic and troubled family while a boxer gets his big shot at the title is pretty standard flare in this sub-genre. The story centering on the strained relationship between two (ex)boxers who are brothers goes where you expect it to go, but the script takes a few unexpected paths to get there. The subplot of Dicky being the subject of a documentary and his trouble with the law changes the arrangement of the boxing story beats just enough to make the story seem really fresh. It is a very engaging tale; Dicky is such a larger than life character and Micky is such an every man that pairing really works.<br/><br/>The direction is remarkably fresh too. The cinematography in the boxing scenes has a dull video quality to it that makes it really feels like it is the 90's and the fake boxing scenes blend well with the actual archival footage used. Furthermore, Russell keeps the camera alive and some of his staging enriches the generational trouble aspect of the story. There is a very tough working class vibe to this film that utterly fits.<br/><br/>The main strength of the film is the acting. I think this is Bale's best performance. He is utterly believable as Dicky; the pain of promise wasted is all over his face. It is a remarkable transfiguration of Bale, both physically, emotionally. Amy Adams really shines in a thankless role of a supportive girlfriend and Leo is just perfect as the tough as nails mother. But to me the real standout is Wahlberg. He is the calm center of the story and he gives a greatly understated performance that fits the every man quality of Mickey. He is the straight man that allows the other flashy performance to work by bouncing off him. It is just a great performance all around.<br/><br/>I very much like this film."
"Screen_Blitz","9","0","1","28 August 2016"," The Fighter is a triumphant piece of cinema from beginning to end
","Over the last few decades, the sports genre has become a home of seemingly endless clichés and entries with predictable endings. Though there have been some surprisingly pleasant (and occasionally original) sports flicks, it is almost difficult to deny the overpopulation of formula the genre continues to throw at us. Director David O. Russell however, grants us with an idea that though isn't empty of formula or particularly original, feels fresh by execution and writing. Tackling on the true story of middleweight boxer Dicky Eklund and his young brother Micky Ward who followed in his footsteps, this biographical drama showcases not only the triumph of David O. Russell's directing but the powerful performances by it's endearing cast. Based on true events in 1980s New Jersey, the film follows the story of Micky Ward (played by Mark Wahlberg), a recently divorced lightweight boxer sprawling his way to score the championship title with the help of his half-brother Dicky Eklund (played by Christian Bale), a former championship boxer who's career took a downward spiral from his drug addiction. After suffering a humiliating loss, Micky finds his chance of making to the championship threatened. From there on, he meets bartender Charlene (played by Amy Adams) who he quickly falls in love with. Soon, when Dicky's petty crimes land him in jail, his relationship with Micky and their already dysfunctional family is put to the test that threatens to not only destroy his chances of winning the championship title, but tear the family apart altogether. <br/><br/>The most important thing in life is family, a powerful message this film packs in. And with David O. Russell's profound direction, the movie falls nothing short of riveting; even if it's little predictable in some spots. Instead of relying on heavily on the lead character's journey as a boxer fighting to reach the championship rank, the plot explores through family dynamics with Micky's family and the dysfunctional relationships that plague the everyday life. His parents, played by Melissa Leo and Jack McGee, are constantly at odds with one another and struggle trying to balance their parenting with their seven daughters and their two sons Micky and Dicky. This results in multiple scenes of verbal sparring that are both intense and emotional to sit through. When Dicky lands himself in prison, the family is forced to face emotional obstacles that place a strain on them, and David O. Russell's maps this out in a way that's more riveting than formulaic. When Micky and his family face these troubles, he learns his only chance of redemption is overcoming his inner demons and making things right with his troublesome brother. Yes, there are some boxing scenes which are brilliantly shot with sheer authencity, and of course the usual training montages you see more often than not. But it is the tumultuous relationship between the two lead characters that plays the vital role in the story. Aside from this is Mark Wahlberg giving one of the most astounding performances of his career, but nowhere near as profounding as Christian Bale who embraces his role with powerful emotional heft that is difficult to ignore. Another shocking performance comes from Amy Adams who is equally tremendous, but also more feisty and aggressive than the roles she's often known for. In fact, one scene includes her engaging in a fist fight that ends in a broken nose. The story would be nowhere near as powerful and compelling if it weren't for the astounding performances this cast delivers.<br/><br/>The Fighter is a triumphant piece of cinema that never feels contrived or uninspired in any sense. From the astounding performances and David O. Russell's witty direction, this film is easily one of the best films of 2010. No, this film is not another 'Rocky' or 'Raging Bull', but it doesn't have to be. What makes the film entertaining is that it's smart, moving, and demonstrates a cinematic effort worth admiring."

It's just typical Hollywood fluff and I honestly can't tell the difference between this performance and his performance in The Big Hit.<br/><br/>Watch it instead for the performance by Christian Bale and the clever writing that surrounds his character. Some good use of dramatic irony and some really effective use of unreliable narrator. The writing that surrounds many of the other characters is also quite solid.<br/><br/>I guess that's the films biggest flaw, the main story line is pedestrian and the acting by the lead similar. Like often happens with based on a true stories, I get the impression that that fact is meant to impress me and make me interested in the main character. What they really needed to do was rely less on that for the main, and more on solid writing."

","Say what ever you want about David O Russell as a person but you cannot deny how brilliant he is as a director and The Fighter is a fantastic movie from him. As I previously said The Fighter is a conventional boxing movie but when making one of them there are a few things that you need to have for one terrific performances and this film has that with Christian Bale manages to do steal the entire movie with his sympathetic and deluded performance making for an extremely interesting character arc. Mark Wahlberg is also fantastic in this movie giving possibly the best performance of his career as Micky Ward because you can just get behind him not just because Wahlberg is a likable actor but because he convincingly conveys the characters personal struggle. Another thing a conventional boxing movie needs in Good boxing matches and they are expertly filmed making for very intense sequences leaving you on the edge of your seat. Melissa Leo is very good in this movie but you never really understand why she is so horrible towards Micky and Adams character and seeing as it is a big part of the movie that's a lot of unanswered questions. The romance between Wahlberg and Adams characters is excellent and that's a good thing because if it hadn't been it could have brought the movie down but no you buy the confidence that Ward gets from Charlene and the chemistry is top notch. The Fighter doesn't hold back on the raw emotion and heartbreak in this movie and it makes you care even more that the characters get over these heartbreaks. The worst thing about The Fighter is its conventional aspects but this is out shined by the performances, characters, direction, arcs making for an excellent movie. 86%-A-"

","I saw the last few minutes while someone else in my home was watching it. It seemed like a good film, so I watched it from the begging. It's an incredible movie. Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg are exceptionable. This is a real story of a young man pulling himself out of poverty by actually using his fists. I didn't know who Wahlberg was before this movie. I'll keep a look out for others movies that he's made. My dad was an only child but he had lots of cousins. He was raised in Dorothy. He was also mellow so it's doubtful we are related.

","I'm a pretty big fan of boxing movies, yes they are all the same, but I really like the story, the final fight and the happy ending. The only one that defies that usual structure is Million Dollar Baby, which is an amazing movie, but whatever. Anyway, The Fighter manages to spice up the generic boxing genre with some well-acted family drama. <br/><br/>This film tells the story of Micky Ward a boxer who is trying to make a comeback, in his ""corner"" are his sassy mother and manager Alice (Melissa Leo), brother Dicky Eklund (masterfully played by Christian Bale), a crack addict who is a former boxer himself and has been coaching Micky for as long as both can remember, and later on, his strong-willed girlfriend, Charlene (Amy Adams, amazing). They all want what is best for Micky, however each one has different opinions on that matter and how to get to achieve their common goal. However, Alice wants the best for the family, not just Micky himself, and Dicky, despite being well- intentioned, he is a total wildcard. Due to all of this, both end up dragging down Ward instead of ultimately helping him. Charlene enters and tries to convince Mickey to leave his family (relating to boxing) and keep boxing without them. It all makes for an amazing story, very well-thought out and entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is superb, after all the cast is what carries the movie. All of the exchanges and relationships between characters are the most interesting part of the film. The lead performance is very good, Wahlberg is very rough and tough, you can relate to his character, a guy who is overshadowed by his older brother. The best performance in the movie though is by Christian Bale, he is a true supporting actor in this movie, steals every scene, god the guy just nails the character, his mannerisms, and all physical features, thin face, slouch, and the way it seems like he is chewing on something when there's nothing in his mouth, amazing stuff, Bale is an expert actor, and his dedication to each role is unrivaled. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo also give extraordinary performances, especially Adams, who is very much out of her usual roles, and does a great job, a very edgy and relatable performance. She gives Micky some needed backbone to make better decisions in his life. Leo is also amazing, a very realistic performance. And the chemistry between all of the actors makes this movie reach new heights in terms of acting.<br/><br/>The script is pretty good, ultimately it is a rags-to-riches story, the ending is predictable in this type of film of course, but the family drama helps the movie become more relatable and interesting. And the dialogue is what does it. David O. Russell's direction is very good, he's a creative director, and I particularly enjoyed his approach to the fights, shooting them like HBO 90s fights, with the crappy camera quality. Another thing worth mentioning is the soundtrack, all of the songs combine perfectly with each scene, none of them were misplaced. <br/><br/>I thought The Fighter was a very fun and interesting movie, plus I really liked the dramatic element, it brought a needed twist to the now tired boxing genre. It has great acting, great dialogue, overall a great film."

He is absolutely perfect for this role and I honestly can not think of any one more deserving or better suited for this role. He spent four years working just to get the build!

","Great movie, and I'm not into boxing. Good human drama, though the rise-to-the-top-against-the-odds boxing story has been done before, many times.<br/><br/>Solid direction from David O Russell.<br/><br/>The movie is driven by the performances though. Christian Bale deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. It is debatable whether he was the lead or supporting actor, though. He has more dialogue and screen time (ignoring the fight scenes) than Mark Wahlberg, and generally carries the movie. Not that Mark Wahlberg's performance was poor, it was just understated, and intentionally so.<br/><br/>Melissa Leo is solid as the mother, but I am not sure she deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Especially as Amy Adams gives a better performance, I believe (and was nominated for the same Oscar).<br/><br/>All this is aided by a superb, rockin' soundtrack - Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Ben Harper, among others. Considering how Led Zeppelin never allow their songs to be used in movies (""Kashmir"" in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" is the only other exception I can think of), the use of ""Good Times, Bad Times"" was quite a coup."
"jackasstrange","9","0","1","18 February 2014"," An inspiring film about overcoming
","David O. Russell did The Fighter in 2010 and probably he did it in the best way possible, since that I generally don't like that much 'Sports' films. I think it's because he, as example of Scorsese in 1980 with his masterpiece Raging Bull, focused more in the story, the character, than in the sport itself. And Is the best way of tell a story, obviously. The protagonist is a loser, and so is his brother and basically all the people around him. Not to be rude with the real 'people', but is in that way the film shows them. A bunch of struggled people trying to win in life and overcome the difficulties. And that is the main idea of the film. <br/><br/>I really loved almost everything about this film. It has a captivating story, great music fitting with the ambient, exceptional acting, I mean, Christian Bale was great, Melissa Leo also was great, but in a lesser extent...and I even liked Mark Wahlberg, whose style I honestly don't care for in all the films I've seen with him. He fitted in the protagonist role. Being said the supporting actors simply stole the film. Oh, and Amy Adams was also good, but honestly I wished her presence to be stronger.<br/><br/>Anyway, there isn't a lot to be said in a quick review about this film, other than it's amazing, filled with great performances and with a great atmosphere. It's character study at it's best. Highly recommended. 8.6/10"
"cityeggmr","10","0","3","1 February 2014"," An Amazing Boxing Drama!
","Story: <br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is a movie based on a true story of the early years of the boxer Micky Ward as he tries to go pro in the mid 1980's. Micky is a young boxer from Lowell with a talent and potential but he keeps getting pulled down by his family who consist of his mother who is his manager, his seven sisters and his older brother who is also his trainer. He doesn't realize that he's basically just there to lose to other fighters and make them look good. His hero and role model since his childhood has been his older brother Dicky who was a good fighter in his younger days and was known as the pride of Lowell for knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. However Dicky became very problematic over the years due to his crack addiction and multiple arrests. Micky meets a young waitress Charlene with which he starts developing a relationship over the time and she supports him in finding better training to realize his full potential.<br/><br/>-The story of The Fighter is great. It's very emotional and very well told. It has great characters, amazing dialog and is relatable. We see Micky struggling with his constant defeats in bad fights due bad managing skills by his mother and brother but he has a hard time abandoning them because they're still his family. It's very well written and directed and there is a good chemistry between the actors.<br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>-Micky Ward is played by Mark Wahlberg. His acting is good in the movie and his boxing skills seem really believable for a young boxer. Although Mark was good in the movie I can't help but notice that he is being overshadowed by other supporting actors. But he still played his part great and his character was really relatable. -Amy Adams plays Charlene, Micky's girlfriend who is helping him get better at what he does. She played the part great as a tough yet likable and supportive girl who's helping Micky get through he's problems even though his whole family generally dislikes her. -Melissa Leo plays Micky's and Dicky's mother. Even though she is sometimes mean and greedy she still loves her family more than anything in the world and doesn't want to see them hurt. Melissa played the part amazingly and got her well deserved Academy Award for it.<br/><br/><ul><li>And finally we got Christian Bale as Dicky Eklund. I cannot stress enough how Christian Bale was good in this movie. He played Micky's brother who is a washed-up fighter having problems with his drug addiction. He portrayed his character amazingly as likable guy who has a lot of problems but still brings a bit of humor to the part. Christian Bale is one of those actors who really becomes the character he plays. He will lose a 100 pounds for a role and then gain it all back for another. He will bulk up or get really fat; he will change the way he looks, walks and talks and will change his personality for a role. He shows complete dedication to what he does and I really like that in actors. At a point in this movie you will start to wonder if he's really on crack. Every time he comes on the screen it's like the movie is giving you a treat. When he comes on scene he completely steals it with his amazing performance. If you don't believe me you should see it for yourself.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall Review:<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" is a great movie with amazing acting, dialog and storytelling, relatable characters and great writing and directing. It's a based on a true story and it's a must-see movie if you like this genre."

","I can not tell you how much the film hit home to me .I enjoyed it very much.. I look forward to what this team does in the future. I think when you put a high caliber production company like them and the acting talent that that have it would only result in a fine end product. I think it's a film that needs to be seen on-the big screen. Waiting to see it home will only rob you of the full experience . So, if you find it in a retro theater house. I highly recommend that you see it. Let me just say that this picture has restored my faith in film making. Now it's not in theaters and is not brand new. But, it's a fantastic film. I got to see this film back in October. It was a well shot film the acting was great. One of the great things about the film is that yeah the location and story line worked but I could almost see it working at any time like with jack Dempsey back in the 1930's. Hope you love this film like I did. All the best. Joe"
"JSplend954","7","0","1","18 January 2014"," ""The Book was Great"", ""The Movie was So-So""
","I'm a huge Micky Ward Fan, and before I watched this movie I was giving it at least a five out of ten, so my vote may be a little biased.<br/><br/>Before viewing the movie, I read the book. It was one of those books that when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. In most cases the book is going to be better than the actual movie, and the reason why is the book goes into much more detail about his life story than the movie. Obviously the movie can't show every event, otherwise its going to be a ten hour movie.<br/><br/>Being a Die-hard Micky Ward fan, it was somewhat unussual watching someone else play him, and I had a hard time getting used to that. Saying that, I wasn't disappointed when I watched the movie. I thought Christian Bale did an excellent job in portraying Ward's half brother DickEklund, and Mark Walhberg was very convincing playing Micky. I didn't like how Ward's sisters were depicted. They were portrayed as being somewhat homely, unattractive and they didn't have any dialogue. Its almost like they were part of a posse. In reality, some of Wards sister's are very pretty.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were pretty good, although I thought they should have shown the Ward - Green fight which was the Friday Night Fight on ESPN. I thought that was the fight that actually turned the corner for Micky. The way in which Micky was able to come back and stop Reggie Green put Micky into prime time, and Reggie Green into retirement.<br/><br/>I would have liked to seen the Ward Gatti trilogy, but I believe they may save that for ""The Fighter II"".<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed it. Micky Ward was definitely a blue collar fighter, and he gave it everything he got, he earned every penny he made and he was a true fan's fighter. If you ever watch a Micky Ward fight you got your money's worth.<br/><br/>For all of the Micky Ward fans, buy the book, you'll enjoy it."
"donuthaters12","9","0","1","5 December 2013"," David O. Russell Marvleous Return
","The Fighter is the first film I have seen from David O. Russell and this is the film that really made me took notice of him. The Fighter had some strong competition during that year which may have caused the film to be lost within the hype of the other films like Black Swan, The Social Network and Inception.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson. The great aspect of the film's writing is that the complications and the relationships in the film feel natural and empathetic. The film focuses on these relationships and how it affects the protagonist. From the beginning of the film, it is easy to see that Micky Ward is driven by the influences from his life and it keeps going that way until Ward himself finally has a grasp on his needs and what is essential to succeed in his career and in a way his personal life. People may see Micky Ward as a guy who can't decide what he wants and not independent enough to make his own decisions. This didn't bother me because these characters are so well defined and their presence and effect on Micky that his emotional and mental condition throughout the film is justifiable. The film also touches on Micky's brother, mother and girlfriend. Their stories and relationship with each other are interesting to watch even if at times it may come off as cliché or melodramatic. The dialogue in this film for the most part surprisingly entertaining with moments that will have you laughing or feeling sad. The well written relationships and the entertaining dialogue drives this film effectively even if the plot sometimes doesn't stray off the mainstream.<br/><br/>David O. Russell directed this feature and I see The Fighter as his comeback film showing what a force he is in the industry. David O. Russell really wanted to make this film be focused with the characters and their relationships rather than the style and visual beauty of the sport. That move was risky as I was afraid Russell may not bring anything new to the genre and it'll just recycle the stories with new characters. Russell wanted this film to be driven more by the performances and he succeeded with characters you would just love to see on screen and I felt he really did bring the best out of these actors because they all seem to be outside their usual stereotypes. While that is going on, he was still able to craft a well done underdog story driven by the protagonist's relationships.<br/><br/>The Fighter's cinematographer is Hoyte Van Hoytema who only gained recognition and success in his work in Let The Right One In. Hoytema and Russell has taken a much more hand-held personal camcorder kind of style of photography having us feel like we are standing next to these characters as things unfold. I personally liked this approach and at first I was a bit afraid that the hand-held style may lead to borderline erratic but it's maintained and carefully handled here. The film jumps back and forth a few times with a cinematic feel and a television sports broadcasting style in telling the story. The former features bulk of the film and the latter is only during the main fights. The latter at times do take away from the personal and intimate approach and this is mostly felt on the deep scenes between characters during the fight, particularly at the climax. There are moments in the film where Russell and Hoytema have taken influence from previous boxing films like Raging Bull.<br/><br/>The Fighter is much more soundtrack driven rather than score driven and it does work for me, though I do wonder how different the tone of the film would be if Michael Brook, the composer for the film, was given the opportunity to create a score replacing the soundtracks. Sometimes in sports films, soundtracks do become a bit cliché and tend to use the same type of music but here I didn't feel that as the tracks are placed in specific moments that it didn't distract me or having me feel that it was cheesy. Michael Brook's score was great when it comes on but it's very rare that I do hear it due to maybe the fact that Russell might feel it may detract from the characters and having us think that it's more than what it is, well it's not and Russell doesn't want us to search for something that isn't really there.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is the main reason that this film is given much praise as it boasts the best performance from Christian Bale, Mark Whalberg, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams so far. I was glad to see that the Academy was able to give them credit where it was due but I was a bit disappointed to see Whalberg on not being nominated. I was amazed on Bale's transformation, just from the first shot where he appears he just looks sickly and disgusting. I was also impressed with Adams transition from her good girl characters to this tough and assertive woman who takes control of the scene every time she's on. Melissa Leo definitely was a standout in this film too who always strives for attention and to be the best in the scene, she seems to get the bets reactions from the actors therefore making the scenes much more effective. Jack McGee was really entertaining to see here, either being subtly funny or being able to add on the drama of the scene. I wish he is able to get much better roles in the future.<br/><br/>The Fighter so far is one of my favorite sports films of all time and also it is tied as my favorite from David O. Russell. I am glad to see Russell coming back and continues to make great films (SIlver Linings Playbook & the upcoming American Hustle)."

","The fighter<br/><br/>This movie is based on a true story, and it is about two brothers. The youngest brother Micky, who is a good boxer, and his bigger brother Dicky, who is coaching him. They are very interested in boxing and their whole family loves boxing too. It is a big match between Micky and a boxer who is much bigger than Micky. He lost, and after this match he was very angry and tired. His brother also had some problems. He was arrested by the police, when he sold his girlfriend to strangers to get money for Dicky. <br/><br/>When the police arrested Dicky, Micky tried to help him. His hand got broken in this battle, because the police knew he was a boxer, and didn't want him to use his hand. Dicky and Micky was sent to prison, but Micky got free. He couldn't box because of his broken hand, so he had a long period without boxing. In this period he also got a new girlfriend.<br/><br/>Micky still wanted to become a professional boxer, so he started training again as soon as his hand allowed him. He had a lot of smaller matches, and started to become a really good boxer. He had a big match in front of him, and trained very hard for this.<br/><br/>Before this match Micky goes to his brother in the prison, and Dicky gave him a good advice. The match started, and Micky did not have a good start. Everybody thought Micky was going to lose. Micky went weaker and weaker as the match went on. But in the end of the match Micky did this trick that he learned from Dicky. Micky boxed him hard on his head and his body many times. This guy fell down and Micky won the big match! It was an enormous exultation.<br/><br/>My opinion: The movie was very good. It was much action and it was always something happening. All the fights was exciting.

That drama is what made me really like this movie.<br/><br/>This film is based on true events as it tells the story of Micky Ward and Dicky Ecklund.

Will Micky let his brother, his new girlfriend, and self-centered family get in his way of reaching that goal? <br/><br/>There were many strong performances in this movie. The most powerful ones were Christian Bale and Melissa Leo. I was shocked to see how much Bale transformed for this movie. He plays Dicky as if he was Dicky in real life. Leo is brilliant as the mother who cares deeply for her sons only if to make a profit for herself. Wahlberg and Adams delivered career-best performances as well.<br/><br/>Overall, The Fighter is a worthy awards competitor. This ranks better than most sports films I have seen.

As Dickey fights his demons, he trains his half-brother Micky as a fighter. <br/><br/>The film documents the struggles of a low-class family whose worlds depend on the success of Micky and his less than stellar boxing career. Micky struggles with the direction his family, mainly his mother Alice (Melissa Leo) who is his manager. After scheduling a fight that will appear on HBO, the opponent falls ill leaving Micky to take on a last minute opponent that was out of his weight class. The match resulted in a loss for Micky and a major beating leaving Micky to believe that his family does not have his best interests at heart. Micky meets his love interest Charlene (Amy Adams) who tries to help him steer his career in the direction that will get him to where he wants to be without the help of his family. Micky begins to see success in the ring with his new trainer and promoter. As Dickey gets himself clean after being in prison and returns to Micky's corner as his trainer, Micky gets his shot at a championship belt. <br/><br/>The use of TV cameras for the boxing matches, the emotions of the characters and the crowd, and the sound of the punches in the ring gave a realistic feel to the film and made the audience feel as if they were there watching the match. Unlike Rocky, whose boxing scenes where that of the actors playing a boxer, they never seem to draw you into the action like the director David Russell does with The Fighter where the boxing matches were raw and realistic. The TV camera footage added a gritty look to the film adding a cheap look that we get from old TV footage.<br/><br/>Though the movie was mainly about Micky's road to a boxing championship, the audience cannot forget about the story between Dickey and Micky who are trying to overcome life's obstacles in order to reach their mutual goal, that of being a boxing champion. The Fighter falls within a predictable pattern of family, love, obstacles and success. The Fighter was based on a true story so that alone draws the audience in. Adding in great actors, music score and an interesting story line and you have the makings of a good film."
"ToxicMegaColon","4","0","2","6 December 2012"," A movie about how to manage your career as a boxer.
","I watched this movie in the hopes that it would be inspirational in giving the message of ""hard work pays off"", or ""losers can be winners"" or something along those lines. <br/><br/>Watching this movie did not convey that message at all. Instead, this was a movie about the intricacies of managing your own career. Dicky (lead character's brother) is Micky's coach, and Alice Ward (Micky's mother) is his manager. Throw in some shenanigan about Micky being offered an opportunity by some random guy to make it big, and it's a movie about family dynamics, and whether or not to betray loyalty to family for career progression. Throw in the mandatory boxing and training scenes, and boom! You've got your movie. <br/><br/>Things I did like about this movie: - The acting was very believable, and the sense of loss is extremely palpable, in addition to the sense of anger and tension before the fights. - The boxing scenes really build up the excitement and atmosphere, although some of the fights are incredibly unbelievable (6 rounds of Micky getting pounded, and a ""head-body-head-body"" combo knocks the opponent out? For real????)<br/><br/>However, there are several things I felt that this movie completely falls short on. <br/><br/>The family dynamics is terribly done, with the result being something really confusing. Micky ends up pissing off both Micky, and the new trainer by refusing to train with Dicky, yet adopting his fighting technique in his fight. I don't see why Micky would adopt his brother's technique when it was never proved if it was effective, and when many of his fights under his brother's guidance were a loss. Yet, he does this under his new trainer (the police officer with glasses (I don't know his name)). Throw in the shouting of profanities, the skanks, whore, slut blah blah with Micky and his girlfriend and his family. <br/><br/>I also don't see why any boxing manager would approach the loser to offer paid training. It doesn't really make sense, with the reason being ""you've got heart"". <br/><br/>The romance was too fake as well. I mean, Micky being in the worse mood ever after losing, falling asleep in the cinema, hardly even talking to Charlene, and they start kissing? My prediction is that Charlene has a fetish for guys who are in foul moods. I thought she'd dump him. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt that this movie didn't really give a solid movie about becoming the best, or the underdog movie. It just gave a film about how best to manage your career as a boxer."
"siderite","9","0","1","15 October 2012"," Great biographical drama about box fighters
","I really like Mark Wahlberg as an actor and, even if I suspect he did this film in order to fondle Amy Adams, he did a great movie here. The fighting scenes were not always perfect, but then again, it is not about the fights, it's about the fighters.<br/><br/>The Fighter perfectly depicts the trap in which some people find themselves, quicksand they can't get out of, holding them down with the unwitting help of family and friends. This is a happy story though, not only in script, but also in real life, since this is not only a sports film, but also a biographical film, based on true events. At two hours in length, it has about 5 minutes of actual fighting, the rest being about the characters.<br/><br/>Mark Wahlberg did a great role, but he was probably overshadowed by Christian Bale, who had the much more difficult role of the older brother. Amy Adams was wonderful, as always; she did have a rather difficult role as well. Kudos to Melissa Leo, an actress I don't know, but who has a lot of acting experience and played the strongest female role in the film and did it well.<br/><br/>Bottom line: on par with Warrior, which was also a 2011 film about fighters coming from broken and low income environments, but with a different feel. Over all, a very impressive and enjoyable film."

","I wanted to see this as soon as I heard it was about ""Irish"" Mickey Ward. I watched his 3 last legendary fights and he won me over. The story itself was a great one. Christian Bale, who played Mickey's brother stole the show and was the real strength of the movie. Amy Adams did a stellar job as well<br/><br/>I only had 3 problems with this movie. 1st, I really didn't like Mark Wahlberg as the lead, there are other actors that I think could have pulled it off better and may not have been so upstaged by Bale. I think the movie portrayed Mickey as a little too soft spoken and sort of passive when it came to things going on around him, but if you ever watched his real interviews he seemed anything but that way. These things aside it was a great movie, but it lost one star for me because it didn't take us to the real glory of this bio.<br/><br/>They only made mention at the end of his legendary fight and the subsequent 2 rematches ( also Legendary), that many of us fans thought he won every one of but got robbed. I understand a little bit if they didn't want to recreate these and leave those fights to stand on their own, but Ithink they missed a great opportunity for people that have never actually watched one of his fights.<br/><br/>Great Story, Great Fight Movie!"
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","12 August 2012"," ""All we ever wanted for you was to be World Champion.""
","If you need a single reason to watch ""The Fighter"", I would point to Christian Bale's performance as the crack addicted former boxer who's purportedly training his younger brother toward a title shot of his own. Bale is simply mesmerizing here, stealing every scene he's in, and even though he took the Best Supporting Actor for his work here, I think an argument could be made that he had a larger role than Mark Wahlberg. At least that's the way I viewed the picture, both times.<br/><br/>What's also fascinating to watch here is the train wreck of a family dominated by Melissa Leo's character, the mother of Dicky Ecklund (Bale) and Micky Ward (Wahlberg). I wouldn't want to speculate how the real life Micky kept his sanity in this household; you just have to go with the flow of the story focusing on his perseverance and loyalty to his brother through all the turmoil.<br/><br/>The film starts out by stating that it's based on a true story, but you know what, I gave up on that notion long ago when it comes to sports biopics. I recently watched ""The Hurricane"" and that one also played fast and loose with historical fact, so the better idea is to go into something like this as coming from someone's skillful imagination. This way you won't be disappointed. OR, you can approach it from the point of view of Dicky who developed an interesting condition affecting his memory bordering on Alzheimer's he dubbed CRS - 'can't remember s---'. I'm going to use that line starting today.<br/><br/>Here's a question - why did it take fifteen years from 1978, the year Dicky fought Sugar Ray Leonard, to 1993, the year this film begins, to have Dicky autograph the fight poster for the barber shop guy in an early scene?"
"quixmelo","9","0","2","9 June 2012"," Great film
","I love character study films and Christian Bale tends to get involved in those types of projects. He does not fail to disappoint in this one - in fact, he surpassed my expectations and his performance as the crack-addicted Dicky Ward absolutely steals the show. I was stunned in the first few minutes of the film by how immersed Christian was in his character - he was virtually unrecognizable with his gaunt frame, hollowed cheeks and wayward mannerisms of a low class Lowell resident. I was not quite as engrossed by Mark Wahlberg's performance in the title role of Micky Ward, though the rest of the supporting cast did an admirable job, including a wonderful performance by Michelle Leo as Micky and Dicky's overbearing mother/manager. I was also pleased with Amy Adams as Micky's flawed but strong girlfriend. <br/><br/>For me, the heart of this film was the interaction and relationship between Dicky and his brother, Micky - it was the strongest point of the film and I give credit to the producers and screenwriters for making that the focal point of the film. Dicky has great love for his brother and family despite his drug addiction, going to great (and at one point, illegal) lengths to support him in any way he can. I found myself becoming emotionally invested in both characters and by the end of the film, I was tearing up alongside with Dicky as he described the pride and love he felt for his brother. <br/><br/>Truly wonderful film and certainly one of Christian Bale's best performances. The man is truly a great and incredibly talented actor."

","There's so much to say about this film. There is the amazingly dysfunctional family. Remember the harpies from Greek mythology. They probably bobbed and weaved like the sisters and the mom in this film. Talk about being sent into the world with two strikes. Then there is the relationship between the brothers. The acting, particularly by Christian Bale is first rate. He is so tightly wound and such a ""loser"" in some ways, yet his heart is pure and he loves unconditionally. I was most impressed with the realistic interaction of the characters. The hopes and dreams that are stunted at every pass and yet there's always hope for a tomorrow. I wonder if this is the anthem of the punch drunk fighter. You've been hit so many times that you don't see the realities of you situation. The love interest is also nicely done. No easy relationships here. In this culture, the heart of gold is going to be tarnished if not impossible. This is gem of a boxing movie."

","The Fighter is a film is based on a true story following two boxing brothers and their family who live in Lowell, Massachusetts during the early 90's. The two brothers Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), and Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) come from a big family. Their mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo) is Mickys manager, Dicky is his unreliable boxing coach, and they have many sisters who help out at the gym. Dicky had his chance in the spotlight when he fought and ""knocked out"" Sugar Ray Leonard back in the mid 1980's. Micky is a struggling ""stepping stone"" fighter and is constantly overshadowed by Dicky in almost everything he does. In the beginning, the viewer is under the impression that Dicky is making a ""comeback"" because he is being followed around by HBO.<br/><br/>Alice and Dicky book a bad fight and Micky loses again. Following the fight Micky is given a great opportunity to train in Las Vegas and get paid, but turns it down because Dicky says he will come up with money to pay him to train and stay in Lowell with the family. In the process of trying to make money, illegally, Dicky gets arrested and goes to jail. We find out he is not making a ""comeback"" but really HBO is making a documentary about crack cocaine addiction. When Dicky is in jail, Micky is starting to get serious with Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) and that's when things start to change. Micky starts making choices that are better for his life and career, rather than letting his family handle everything. This is where the theme is most present. Micky feels he must choose between family and a career, and he doesn't realize that he can have both he just needs to have balance. The theme of this film is very similar to the film Warrior, which is also based on a true story of two brothers who fight in the UFC (O'Connor, 2011).<br/><br/>The editor did a great job with this film. I was entertained throughout the film because of the action and how he pieced the scenes together. One of the editing techniques I enjoyed was the change of film stock during the flashbacks and memories. The film was very rough and grainy and looked dated, it was very realistic. The passage of time was made easier with quite a few montages but they were all necessary. The montages reminded me of the training montages in the film Rocky. My favorite part of this movie was the freeze frame at the end, when Dicky is holding up Mickys arm to signify the victory and we get to see that moment frozen in time and it captures the emotion perfectly. Overall this is a great film about fighting for your career and family and standing up for what is right for you.<br/><br/>References O'Connor, G. (Director). (2011). Warrior Motion Picture.

","The movie begins with two boxers talking to a camera crew. In a subsequent scene the camera crew follow the two, Dicky (Christian Bale) and Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) through working class neighborhood of Lowell, MA. The HBO camera crew follows Dicky to film, what he believes is his ""comeback"" documentary. Dickey once had a title fight against ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard, which he lost, but remains his single claim to fame. People of Lowell come to show support for the former ""Pride of Lowell"" and to see the camera crews. This is an insight into Mickey's character. As he greets people, he is serious, but shows compassion, giving a young man a hug, who's mentally challenged. It's obvious Mickey often takes time to say hello and treat him kindly.<br/><br/>Then Mickey trains at the gym, but his trainer Dicky is hours late, which is common for Dicky to irresponsibly miss commitments. Sgt. Micky O'Keefe (self) fills in training Mickey, but as his mother, Alice Eklund, (Melissa Leo) arrives, she's annoyed O'Keefe is training Mickey, explaining it's Dicky's job. She is preoccupied with everything but Mickey's career, although she's his manager. She's concerned about wearing her best outfit for cameras and that they filmed her walking in OK. Then she presents scrapbooks of Dickey's fight career. This is the introduction to the chain smoking, self-absorbed mother and manager of Mickey. She's preoccupied with Dicky's comeback, when his time has definitely passed. She seems to want what's best for her sons, but is unsure how to provide it. She believes the only people who can help Mickey become a title fighter is their family. However, it's his brother who's smoking crack with friends when he supposed to be training Mickey.<br/><br/>The entire family is at a bar, where Mickey admires the brazen bartender, Charlene (Amy Adams). His father, George Ward (Jack McGee) encourages him to finally talk to her. Mickey tells her about his upcoming fight, explaining he is not a ""stepping stone"" fighter. He makes a date to go out with her when he returns from the fight. While in Atlantic City, the promoter informs the family the opponent Mickey has prepared to fight canceled, but has a replacement, who's ""off the couch,"" meaning he is in poor shape and ill prepared. Everyone refuses until they learn no one will get paid if Mickey doesn't fight. Mickey hesitates because the other fighter is significantly heavier, but his mother and brother pressure him, and Mickey concedes because no one will get paid. The moment Mickey sees Mungin, he knows he's in trouble because he is large and in great shape, but has the determination to go through with the fight. His brawler, toe-to-toe style fighting cannot help him. A promoter offers Mickey a chance to get paid to train in Las Vegas, and as his family repeats ""ESPN owes us,"" we see Mickey sitting there in the limo contemplating going a different direction, branching away from his family. Mickey returns to Lowell with his face beaten, his ego bruised, and embarrassed he lost the televised fight. Mickey goes into hiding and doesn't show up for his date with Charlene, and she won't accept this. She goes to his apartment demanding to know why. She sees his face and has more of an understanding. He explains he took on a larger opponent because no one would get paid if he didn't fight, and she asks if his family is doing right by him. They've just become acquainted and she spots it immediately, and it has played through his mind since the limo ride. Charlene becomes Mickey's girlfriend and helps him see to rid himself of dysfunction in his corner. She gives him the courage to stand up to his family, who openly dislike Charlene, and begin to surround himself with professionals. Mickey's father, George Ward, also feels strongly about Mickey working with professionals that he puts himself in a predicament with his own wife. At times, Mickey's ""crazy family"" push Charlene away, but she returns. She's there to show her support and help Mickey do what is best for him.<br/><br/>Mickey surrounds himself with great people, which after his brother's prison stay, includes him as his trainer. Dicky gets sober and focused in prison after the harsh reality is depicted in the HBO special. Against everyone's advice, Mickey wants Dicky in his corner because through his string of wins he relied on what Dicky taught him. It's Dickey who goes to Charlene and the others to get the team reunified. Then Mickey gets a shot at the WBU welterweight title. The family goes to London for the fight and finally they show support without interfering. There's a moving scene with the two brothers standing at the entrance of the arena, silhouetted by bright lights, as Dickey mentally prepares Mickey. It's a situation Dickey knows well - it's as important to be mentally prepared. Dickey is showing love and support and for once not trying to steal the spotlight. It's a great fight with both boxers trading blows, but Mickey is losing. With a pep talk from Dickey in his corner, Mickey enters the ring with a barrage of punishing punches and Micky wins by TKO! Fight scenes look realistic because of cuts and slow motion shots, which were also used in Raging Bull. Adding to the realism, the commentator's voices and comments were used from the actual fights, and aspects of the fight were carefully recreated. Mark Wahlberg wanted to give a real look and feel, so he refused a stunt double, taking punches himself.<br/><br/>This film is a drama, based on the compelling true story of boxers Mickey Ward and Dicky Ecklund. It's a story of a strong, kind man who beats the odds, coming from a working class neighborhood with limited resources. It's a heart-wrenching story about love, perseverance, forgiveness, and family as much as the boxing. Performances are captivating and realistic, and set up an emotional, dramatic plot."
"beasy03","9","0","3","29 April 2012"," Great film based on a struggling family who makes it.
","The Fighter is a very well directed, exciting film starring Mark Wahlberg as Micky Ward; an underrated boxer from the small town of Lowell. Micky's older half brother Dicky Eklund played by Christian Bale, is more of the star in the town of Lowell than Micky during the beginning of the movie. Dicky or ""The Pride of Lowell"" is known for his one boxing match against Sugar Ray Leonard in which he knocked the champ down, but still lost the fight. As Dicky struggles with drug addiction Micky begins to train harder and harder for upcoming fights, but his family and mother particularly are holding him back because they don't believe in him. In fact Micky's family is still holding on to hope for Dicky, hoping he will get off the drugs and get back into boxing. It felt as if Micky was useless and Dicky was the star, we discover that this is false and in fact Micky is the star. As Micky continues training his girlfriend Charlene convinces him that his family is in fact holding him back. The story continues and Micky starts winning fights left and right, while his brother Dicky continues to struggle with addiction. Micky's family begins coming together and supporting him at this point and his brother Dicky even starts coming to his senses and helping Micky with tips to help his succeed. Micky eventually wins the title and his family is put back together.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is clearly that a family can overcome overwhelming obstacles when they come together as a unit. This theme is shown when the Ward family is separated, Alice and all of Micky's sisters were in a sense ""babying"" Dicky with the hope that he will get off drugs and go back to boxing. During this time nobody is in Micky's corner except for Charlene who pushes him away from his distraught family. Once Dicky gets his head on straight I believe he realizes that he can help his underdog brother become the champion. Despite all of the struggles, obstacles, and bad luck; this family comes together to help, and support each other which ends in Micky becoming the Champion.<br/><br/>We have seen this theme before in the film The Family Stone, though it is a much different film than The Fighter the theme is the same. In The Family Stone a family is brought together to be mean to one of their siblings future fiancé. This in return results in the family recognizing their faults similar to The Fighter and eventually come together for one common goal, a good Christmas.<br/><br/>During The Fighter we are shown several unique techniques for instance the sound effects that are heard but not seen. Also known as invisible sound, we hear church bells, police or ambulance sirens, and cars driving outside which add to the small town feeling we get from the town of Lowell. The small town feeling is essential in this film because Dicky is the ""small town hero"". If this was based on a story in a big city many people in the city would not know about Dicky, but in Lowell everyone knows Dicky. I feel this small town fame got to Dicky's head which leads to his drug use and road down a failing boxing career. Another technique used is the lighting; this film is intended to be in the late 80's and early to mid 90's and the lighting of the film really shows that. By using a lot of natural lighting the film seems a little dingy, not real bright and flashy unlike modern action films we see today. This defines this time period perfectly old fashioned, close knit town, hard working community; all of those things are basic and are best paired with natural lighting."

","I watched this movie against my will and was pleasantly surprised. I am not a big boxing fan and I truly expected to be bored. I wasn't. The movie is based on a true story and is about a young boxer, ""Irish"" Micky Ward (played by Mark Wahlberg), and how he got his acceptance into the boxing community. His older half-brother, Dicky Eklund (played by Christian Bale) was a retired boxer who had slipped into a life of drugs. Dicky was training Micky and he had taught him everything he knew, but the drugs made him unreliable. Micky's mom, Alice Ward (played by Melissa Leo) was his manager and Micky was losing most of his fights. Dicky gets incarcerated and gets clean. While Dicky is in jail, Micky gets a new manager and trainer and he starts winning fights. The main theme of the movie is to never give up. Another is family is important; and finally – drugs are bad. When Dicky gets released he is shunned by the new training team but Micky insists on wanting his brother back on the team. With them all working together, Micky can focus and he goes on to win the title. I am a fan of both Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg. At first I was appalled at Christian's acting, but in the credits the ""real"" Dicky is shown and he proves that Christian was actually pretty ""spot on."" Christian's gaunt drug-user look was fascinating to me because I had never seen him that thin. Mark on the other hand obviously had a lot of training for the movie as his physique was remarkable (no pun intended). It's a ""rags to riches"" story, much like ""Rocky"". The angles of the fighting shots; as well as them being shot in slow motion, really grab the viewer. I commend the actors for taking actual hits because they really looked like they hurt. Micky had a lot of things going against him; finances, lack of direction, and losing his ""hero"" to drugs. Micky never gave up; not on himself, or on his brother. He went on to win, but was still humble, a good sport, and thankful for what he got."

The main problem was it being filled with disgusting human beings. It's hard to even empathize with Wahlberg, as he is so stupid concerning his own life. Bale is a selfish prick with delusions of grandeur, Leo is an absolute BITCH of a human being. They are poor, common and self centered. In the end, Wahlberg goes crawling back to his family, and though it's nice to see forgiveness, it also just made me hate him. Only Jack McGee and Mickey O'Keefe are having any kind of loving humanity running through their veins, so it's a shame they aren't as utilized. The performances are grand, especially Bale, deserving his Oscar. But with so much tension, and cruelty flowing through the dialog and actions, nobody really gets what they deserve.Still, if you focus on Wahlberg alone, and follow him as the underdog, it still manages to inspire and chill (in a good way)."

","The Fighter is a film about a future boxing champion and the conflicts he has with his overbearing mother and drug addicted brother. Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a gifted boxer who has not been properly managed. He is believed to be a ""stepping stone"" for other boxers. The actions of his crack addicted brother, Dicky Ecklund (Christian Bale) and poor career management by his mother, Alice (Melissa Leo) results in the difficulty Micky has had in his career.<br/><br/>Micky chooses to remain loyal to his family by having Dicky be his trainer. Dick, a shell of his former self, used to be a professional boxer and his only career achievement was beating Sugar Ray. He has been addicted to drugs for many years, is irresponsible, and is seldom serious about his brother's career. Many times he is late for training and will disappear for days. Micky knows of his brother's problems but chooses not to speak out against him, even though his career is hurting because of Dicky.<br/><br/>Alice is the overbearing mother who manages Micky's boxing career. If anyone defies her choices, she lashes out and accuses them of going against the family. Micky's sisters seem to resemble Alice in their attitudes, showing how influential she has been on them over the years. She books fights against heavier opponents for Micky, because of the money offered. Because of her horrible management, Micky's fights are one-sided and they hurt his professional career.<br/><br/>Micky's beliefs about his family's actions begin to change after he starts dating Charlene (Amy Adams). She has a strong personality that allows her to speak anything on her mind. In many ways, her personality is very similar to Alice's and Micky's sisters, which may be why he is attracted to her. Her outside view of Micky's family allows her to explain to Micky that having his family promote his career is a terrible decision, and that they are not looking out for him. He learns that he can become a famous boxer without his mother and brother, and decides to train with Mickey O'Keefe (playing himself) and be managed by Sal Lanano (Frank Renzulli).<br/><br/>Eventually, Micky's family argues with Charlene, O'Keefe, and Lanano. Micky speaks out against this by telling everyone he is the one fighting and this is supposed to be about what he wants. By speaking out against everyone, Micky shows that he has become confident in himself and is willing to change how things are done to become a successful boxer. His only wish is for the people around him to cooperate and support him for the title match.<br/><br/>Change is the theme in The Fighter. Micky becomes confident and speaks up against those around him, instead of following what is chosen for him. Dicky sobers up after being in prison and chooses not to continue that lifestyle after his release. Christian Bale loses weight to play the drug addicted Dicky, and then he gains weight back to show the great change that happens when a person overcomes an addiction to drugs. Dicky also admits that his defeat over Sugar Ray was because Sugar Ray had tripped in their match. Alice learns to allow Micky to make his own choices and to trust others.<br/><br/>Micky's boxing style is a motif for the film's theme. During his professional fights, Micky is defensive and absorbs the blows from his opponents. He places his arms up to block punches, but is unable to fight back. This is metaphoric to the damage his family does to his career, and Micky refuses to fight back by speaking out against his mother and brother. After his hand is healed, Micky continues to fight and uses the same strategy, but not he fights back with hits of his own, at the correct spots, to beat his opponent. Just like in his professional bouts, Micky now speaks up against the conflict caused by those in his life.<br/><br/>Parallel cutting is used to differentiate between the contrasting personalities of Micky and Dicky. One scene will show Micky being responsible by training, and then the scene will cut to Dicky being under influence when he is supposed to be training Micky. The scene cuts with Dicky shows the audience the personality changes he undergoes during the film.<br/><br/>Many sports films share a similar theme. To become a better athlete, the main character needs to make changes in their lives. In Rocky, the main character has to face personal problems that hinder his ability to become the best boxer."

","The Fighter, directed by David Russell, is a film based on the true story of the boxer Mickey Ward. The film follows brothers Mickey, played by Mark Wahlberg, and Dicky, played by Christian Bale. It takes place 15 years after Dicky defeats boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and in a time in Mickey's career when he is looking to get back in the game. In this film older brother Dicky is trying to train and prepare Mickey to be a fighter as well, but Dicky has developed a drug addiction and is unreliable to Mickey and helping his career. His mother (Alice), played by Melissa Leo, and does an amazing job in her role as a mother of nine and Mickey's manager. Mickey's girlfriend (Charlene), played by Amy Adams serves as his supportive girlfriend trying to help Mickey reach his goals without his families influence. The film follows Mickey's struggle to be the champion his brother never was, and his brother's struggle to fight drugs and the life he has built for himself that he doesn't want to face. <br/><br/>While it seems as though the theme would be boxing, or something relating more to the idea of the underdog rising above, I felt this movie focused more on family. It was a reoccurring idea throughout the film, both the need and the importance of the family. In Mickey's situation he wanted to succeed and earn his title but he didn't want to do it without Dicky's help. Even though his mother, Alice, got him in a fight he couldn't handle and his brother was constantly late or high he ended up relying on them the most in the end. The motifs throughout the film also suggest the importance of family. The family appears throughout the movie as a unified front. The sisters show up together to fight with Charlene, to protect Mickey. As well, they are shown together watching Mickey's fights, welcoming Dicky home from jail and supporting their mother in her emotional breakdowns. The director also uses light to convey the feelings of the characters. Through the use of low-key lighting and natural lighting the mood comes across a a little drab, especially when the scenes are taking place in Lowell, Massachusetts. It's only when things get better and Mickey's boxing career takes him to Vegas does the lighting change. <br/><br/>All in all, I felt this was a good film depicting the life and family of a boxer. I would definitely recommend this movie. Whether you agree with this family or not they stick together and support each other the only way they know how to. I feel that this film gave us a glimpse of very raw emotion of characters whose lives have not turned out the way they thought they would."

","In the first three minutes of THE FIGHTER, we realize that Christian Bale should not have won that Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this film. He should have won for Best ACTOR.<br/><br/>Yes, we know the technical definitions of ""main,"" ""major,"" and ""supporting"" characters - but really! Bale's Herculean immersion into his wild-eyed character drove this film, which, without his involvement, would have been merely another lazy story about an underdog clawing his way to the middle echelons of a testosterone-induced inferiority-complex dick measuring competition; to call boxing a ""sport"" is to imply it has some intrinsic spiritual worth.<br/><br/>BALE is to THE FIGHTER what Kilmer is to TOMBSTONE, what Brando is to STREETCAR, what Day-Lewis is to GANGS OF NEW YORK.<br/><br/>Bale is Dicky Eklund, a gregarious, trouble-seeking, ex-boxer from ""Bahston,"" who trains and manages his younger brother ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) with the best intentions, yet with no clout to take Micky into the bigger leagues where he belongs. Mother Alice (Melissa Leo) co-manages with big dreams and bigger hair.<br/><br/>Dicky's claim to fame is that he once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. (Leonard plays himself alongside Bale and Wahlberg - still looking twenty years younger than his age.) Since this movie is based on real life characters, we see some old footage of the real Eklund swiping at Leonard and Leonard hitting the canvas; contention to this day whether Leonard slipped.<br/><br/>But Dicky is a junkie. Though he must have once retained a modicum of discipline to grace the ring with Leonard, when we meet him here, he is so way past gone that when HBO interviews him and follows him around with a camera crew for a documentary on crack addiction, he sincerely thinks they are documenting his boxing comeback.<br/><br/>Bale's performance is magnetic, crafting a character through mind and body; gaunt, emaciated, a junkie for all intents and purposes. Oldman, Seymour Hoffman, De Niro. Bale is an actor willing to go so deep into his role that we truly think he lives there; an actor who makes us forget he was someone else in his previous movies - we do not look at this incoherent, twitchy crackhead and immediately think, ""Hey, this guy is John Connor!"" - and we really have to woik our imaginations to believe this beanstem could possibly be the Dark Knight! Further, deponent sayeth not; the awards speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Wahlberg diametrically opposes Bale's extroversion and brings a studied quietude to a role that demands of him an Eastwood-ian intensity coupled with a Schwarzenegger power behind his shoulders. And his underwear modeling days serve him in good stead - his physicality is explosive. If Bale wasn't here ass-klowning around, then Wahlberg would have been lauded as this movie's driver. He's become a very efficient actor - from annoying New Kid On The Block, to weaning off his baby-fat in FEAR, to the reasonable SHOOTER, to his slap-in-the-face performance in DEPARTED, we've seen him grow into this starring role. Well done, my son! The Gay-For-Wahlberg Express is boarding now...<br/><br/>Let's get something straight about the difference between this movie and the people that this movie portrays. The MOVIE is excellent. These PEOPLE (the usual salt-of-the-Earth epithet is ""they're good people"") are a bunch of pugilistic rednecks; they're in a profession that glorifies unprovoked battle - people beating up each other for no reason other than the created reason of income; they're in and out of jail, their lives revolve around alcohol, drugs and fighting (not necessarily in the ring). When you see the trailers for this Award-winning film, the soundtrack makes it seem like something epic is being achieved. It is not. It's about two roughnecks who know nothing much about anything else. The actors' PERFORMANCES make this movie compelling.<br/><br/>THE FIGHTER follows the tribulations of Wahlberg's Micky before he went pro in the mid-80s, as he tries to literally and metaphysically fight his way out of the security zone of his trailer trash environs.<br/><br/>He dates barmaid Charlene (Amy Adams looking voluptuously trailer) and butts heads with his family to accept her - a gaggle of sisters who all look like men and speak like education hasn't been invented yet; he must constantly drag Dicky out of the crack house; he must contend with Dicky's jealousy when an agent offers him paid training in Vegas (to raise the money to train in Boston instead, Dicky puts his crackhead girlfriend out on the street hooking); he must contend with Dicky getting in trouble with the law (during one street fight, a cop breaks Micky's hand); he finds himself at the center of two families - his girl and trainer pit themselves against his trailer siblings and mother.<br/><br/>THE FIGHTER boasts boxing scenes as realistic as having your jaw rattled by a roundhouse. We have grown so inured to the fakery of the ROCKY films (and their imitators), where the fighters box without blocking and the punches resound like thunderclaps, that seeing the realistic boxing style of these guys is refreshing. Wahlberg trained for years for this role, and it shows. Where are YOU looking when he takes his shirt off? <br/><br/>Reliable character actor Jack McGee is Micky's father; Mickey O'Keefe, a real life policeman and friend of the family who trained Micky, plays himself. Now training Wahlberg, which must have been surreal for him.<br/><br/>During the end credits, we meet both real life brothers, Micky and Dicky, and we realize just what amazing jobs Wahlberg and Bale did personifying them. Visually, we immediately recognize who is who, and when they speak, it's over. What the hell! - give a Best Actor award to BOTH those guys!"

","Myself and my friend since school went to see this at Glasgow Cineworld for my birthday in February, (Courtesy of my wonderful gf!), with a hip-flask of Bushmills Irish whiskey and high hopes, (We'd been waiting on this film since Wahlberg 1st admitted interest in Micky ward's life.) Loved the film from start to finish! Amazing acting, story, characters and humour. Whether you're aware of Micky ward as a boxer or not, doesn't matter. The film is more the drama behind the scenes of his fights, than the fights themselves. In particular, the performances of Wahlberg, Bale & Adams are spot-on. Especially with the difficult Massachussetts accent! The book ""Irish Thunder: The hard life and times of Micky Ward"" is well worth reading. This is one of the most enjoyable films i've ever seen and in my personal top 20 films ever. :)"

","There have been some very good films about boxing. ""Raging Bull"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and others. ""The Fighter"" can be added to this list without any doubt.

""The Fighter"" has it all, although more realistic, more complex and perfectly told. <br/><br/>Every member of this crew really knows how to make a movie. I've spent a perfect time watching it and suggest everybody to watch it too. The absolute highlights of this movie: Christian Bale's performance, the illustration of a low mid-class family-clan, the illustration of people living in a City called Lowell, the music (training montage!!), realistic boxing, and much more.<br/><br/>There are only a few movies feeling so right. 10**********"

","Though ""The Fighter"" presents itself as another boxing movie, it has much more to offer. The story's focus is Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who dreams of winning a boxing title. The plot includes the relationships with his bartender girlfriend (Amy Adams), his brother Dicky (Christian Bale), his mother (Melissa Leo) and the remaining members of his family. Despite Wahlberg being the lead, the supporting cast steals the show. <br/><br/>Both Bale and Leo won Oscars for their performances. Having seen this, both thoroughly deserved them. I've seen Bale in many movies, dating back to when he was a kid. He has really grown up and engulfed himself into his character, which goes on a path of drug abuse, prison, and later redemption. His character is a jerk to the core, yet he builds sympathy for his character. He's hard not to like; he's funny, charming, and knows how to throw a good punch. <br/><br/>Like Bale, Leo adds quite a few layers to her character. Rather than following the one- dimensional villainous mother, she comes off as someone to pity rather than despise. She does what she thinks is right for her son Micky, but she's so blinded by this that she fails to realize what he really wants. ""The Fighter"" could very easily have fallen into the category of a soap opera (and to a degree it is), but it so much better and more believable via such powerful performances. <br/><br/>David O. Russel has made a well-done masterpiece. ""The Fighter"" will make you laugh a lot. It will engage and move you. And it may even make some cry. The only regret I have about this film is that I did not see it in theaters. Even so, I am glad that I viewed this film, and I will definitely watch it again in the future."

","The story follows the same basic narrative as just about every other boxing movie ever made. The only thing that differentiates this film from others about boxing is the people surrounding the boxer. Unfortunately, there's little to like about those people. It is hard to feel any sympathy for these characters because they are the very definition of ""poor white trash."" Poor script and direction don't help matters. Wahlberg is rather bland in the title role, and there's no way he is a welter weight. Bale is annoying as his crack-addicted brother, with much of what he says unintelligible due to slurring and mumbling. Adams outshines her costars as a tough broad."
"Gin-ster","Null","0","1","30 July 2011"," Excellent film with occasional digression into SNL skit
","The film is excellent, overall, in creating interest in the lives of its main characters. Even though I am far from being a boxing fan, and the fight scenes were repugnant, I was interested in finding out how things would turn out, and I credit excellent story-writing and acting by the two main leads. Mark Wahlberg has, elsewhere, been criticized for being bland in the role but his restraint made me think of the saying ""less is more."" The only criticism, and this is frankly a significant one - which caused me to rate the film lower than I might have - is that it occasionally turned into an SNL skit, i.e. cartoonish caricatures were occasionally injected into an otherwise serious drama. When all the sisters and the mother were together, I kept thinking of the SNL skit ""Bronx Beat"" in which Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph pretend to be extremely vulgar Bronx women - rather poorly, I might add (although that is another review.:)) The film's portrayal of these ""blue collar"" Massachusetts women, as vulgar, ugly, and stupid, was a cheap caricature; it kept bringing it down to the level of an SNL skit and it was out of place in this serious drama. I would nevertheless recommend the film, but it loses points in my estimation due to these intrusions."

","Another movie has brought me to the brink of tears. First, Akeelah and the Bee, now, The Fighter. I must be getting softer as I age. This has all occurred in the span of the past three weeks. Prior to this, I hadn't nearly cried at a movie since I viewed Savannah Smiles, years ago. Those movies that portray the emotions of influential children get to me. The Fighter had that and adults behaving like children. That combined with the striking realism of the fight sequences, poignant soundtrack, and excellent acting across the board produced a dramatic movie (based on a true story) that I could not take my eyes off of. Highly recommended especially for sports fans familiar with Mickey Ward's life and career."

","Based on the true story of boxer ""Irish"" Micky Ward's unlikely road to the world light welterweight title.<br/><br/>His Rocky-like rise was shepherded by half-brother Dicky, a boxer-turned-trainer on the verge of being KO'd by drugs and crime.....<br/><br/>When it comes to awards season, there is always one film i want to see, but make excuses not to see it. This is the film, and although it's taken me nearly six months to see it, i'm not really that bothered I missed it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Sure, the film is a great morality tale of the working class man making it big despite family getting in the way. The scenes with Mickys sisters and his mother have some of the best put down dialogue in a film this year, and both bittersweet and funny. Bale and Adams are perfect in their respective roles and really bring the film to life.<br/><br/>And the pugilism scenes are the most realistic and bonecruncing since De Niro stepped into the ring.<br/><br/>But I wasn't blown away by the film, it's good, but nothing to scream about, and I blame Wahlberg for this, because the man is just too bland for his own good. The only time he puts any heart into his role is when he is sharing time with Bale, and it's a good job, because Bale would have made him look more wooden than he is in Max Payne.<br/><br/>He isn't terrible, he just seems uninterested, and there is a look on his face throughout with a realisation that he is being acted off the screen from every angle. A lot of people are saying that it's his best performance. I say, go back to 1996 and see Fear, he's never been better.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because the story is so full of rich dialogue and wonderful narrative, you really try hard to like it, but the titular character ruins it.<br/><br/>Lucky Christian 'Bales' him out...."
"TheHrunting","10","0","1","8 July 2011"," A tale of fists and family
","This is a film dealing with having a dream about doing something for yourself and then having to make sacrifices with personal relationships in order to get there. An up and coming boxer named Micky Ward (Wahlberg) from the rough town of Lowell, Mass in the '90s has a community that stands by him as well as a large family to give a helping hand with training, promotion and attempting to secure fights to show off his magic. Everybody gives their unconditional love the best they can, but are stuck in a routine and he wants to break away without hurting those who've always been there.<br/><br/>Dicky (Bale) is training his younger brother Micky, who always looked up to him, to make it as a pro. Dicky knows the sport like the back of his hand and is likable and passionate but isn't always in control as he's not able to help himself when it comes to abusing substances. It's evident to everybody but himself that he's still living in a certain part of his past with his mind stuck in a loop. Dicky is being filmed for an HBO documentary on crack addiction but that doesn't stop him from scheming and getting into trouble with the law. He's unreliable and their protective mother, who is also Micky's manager, tries but doesn't know any better which makes matters worse.<br/><br/>Micky gets more and more involved with a straight-shooting woman named Charlene (Adams) that works as a bartender. She's as much a warrior as himself and he's got to win her over, but once the lioness is tamed she lends courage and support to see through the barriers. A new promoter and trainer offer better opportunity with the promise of consistency, but the rule is as long as that doesn't include the reckless brother and overbearing mother. This puts Micky between a rock and a hard place as his brother--who now went through detox and gained some perspective from the documentary--gave him sound advice in a fight.<br/><br/>Some sports movies don't always find a balance between the struggle and the glory, and can fall into a trap of being predictable and crutched on the finale. ""The Fighter,"" however, made it worth it due to a journey that grows and expands in between and doesn't gamble everything it's got on the ""big one."" This isn't selling the audience a you-can-do-it-too sports dream but rather to show that if you want to make it in anything, that making sacrifices, even impossible ones, is all part of the process of committing to your goals and aspirations. Micky is just one character among many, including the town of Lowell itself. It shows the real life people in positive and negative light, which gives some breathing room to the viewer instead of playing it as sappy and sentimental. The tone isn't all a heavy hitting drama, with some classic radio songs from an earlier era, as well as a layer of dry humor with some situations being slightly exaggerated for effect.<br/><br/>What truly made this picture stand out were the performances. Christian Bale did a fantastic job portraying the typical addict syndrome: it's never their fault, give them another chance, that person screwed them--it's all a conspiracy. It's uncanny if you've ever met or had contact with someone of the sort. The character makes promises he knows he can't keep, acts selfish, is a showboat for attention. Bale truly loses himself to the role as he got every single mannerism down to a T, and even with all negativity said didn't make you want to completely hate him--which makes sitting through this dramatic but not overbearing. Amy Adams went from making it big on ""Catch Me If You Can"" as the nice and innocent young girl, to here a hardened, street-tough woman who doesn't take any nonsense or just act as a feminine shoulder to cry on. It's refreshing to see a female role that isn't just pretty decoration for the background or if she's confident act like a one-note b with an itch. The mother and sisters--while slightly over-the-top to make an impression--came together as if they were just a close-knit family of locals that lean on each other. The performers ultimately made the story captivating and gave out a level of care for their trials and tribulations from this unheard of town to most in New England that made them what they were.

","So I just watched the fighter. I think the name Spirit would be better for this film. But let's start from the beginning. It's a story of Michy Ward who is a boxer. So his mother's his manager and his brother played by Bale is his trainer. Naturally his a good boxer but his brother who's on crack rarely comes to the training and when he comes he always late and his mother just a terrible manager who gives him all the wrong fights and he... but that's enough otherwise what's the point of watching it? So characters in this movie are great. All of them. All his family irritates you hell of a lot just like they're suppose to. My favorite two characters are Matt's and Christian's. Matt plays good but Bale is just... well he had to take crack when filming and I wouldn't be surprised if he did. So he plays here even better then in American phyco and in the dark knight which I thought was impossible. So there ain't any special effects but the boxing science look awesome. They much more interesting that real box of cause they don't show the whole match but what they do show is great. The ending is predictable as hell but it doesn't matter because you'll be enjoying this movie so much that you don't care about predictability. So if by the end of this movie you won't feel lifted you're just not human."

","The only amazing thing about this movie and story is how the real fighter managed to achieve success - if all the lunacy displayed in this movie was what he had to endure in real life.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the story of Mickey Ward who became a world champion boxer and his 'crazy' family.<br/><br/>As for the movie well it seems to have got more attention than it deserved in my opinion.<br/><br/>Christian Bale did do a very good job (seemingly effortlessly) - in displaying a zany train-wreck character. The junkie ex-boxer turned trainer and the half brother of the aforementioned Mickey Ward.<br/><br/>Ward was played by 'Marky' Mark Wahlberg who was a bit of a let down to be honest. I love Wahlberg normally he is cool, edgy and tough but in this seemed a bit out of his depth and looked uncomfortable acting as a boxer. His muscled out body (for this role) made him look all wrong to me - his normal physique looks much better.<br/><br/>Maybe Wahlberg deliberately played the quiet one compared to his domineering mother/manager played by Mellisa Leo and his 'in your face' over the top older half-brother Dickey Eklund (Bale) who once 'floored' (or was it a slip) the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard during a fight.<br/><br/>To be honest his mother and sisters of whom there were many looked far more scary than Wahlberg's - Mickey Ward.<br/><br/>The Sisters in particular looked like totally messed up 'trailer trash' characters who would not have looked out of place in the film 'Deliverance'. They were actually my favourite part of the movie to be honest - very funny, crazy and scary and well acted.<br/><br/>The love interest of the fighter was played by Amy Adams who did a reasonable job i suppose.<br/><br/>The 2 Oscars for best supporting roles? -Bale just for sheer lunacy and effortless acting of such a character maybe deserved to win and Leo too maybe as the mum character really got under my skin and caused me some emotion - i actually felt like slapping her a few times to shut her up ha ha. Mind you i didn't see the other nominees performances as yet.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely no Rocky which is the benchmark of boxing movies. Million Dollar Baby and Cinderella Man i really enjoyed and can recommend as great movies too (I have not seen Raging Bull to comment).<br/><br/>'The Fighter' is just not memorable really - the boxing scenes were poor but maybe based on what the actual fights were like. (but there was no passion here i didn't care if he won or lost whereas - I used to cry and scream at the TV when Rocky was fighting with emotion that was real) - Some say the Rocky fights were not great - but the thing is I loved the character and really wanted him to win. The best fight scene in this movie is between the girlfriend and a couple of the sisters - awesome compared to the boxing bouts on show.<br/><br/>As i said the highlights of this movie are Bale's crazy performance - the scary bunch of sisters for sheer entertainment - and the crazy domineering mum - but she was a bit too annoying really.<br/><br/>One of the sisters is actually quite sexy looking but i don't know the name of the actress or the name of the character. The rest of them I would prefer not to meet in a dark alley. (No offence to the actresses I am sure it was all make-up and great acting that made them so scary and freaky.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for sure and maybe you will enjoy as I did too in some aspects - but don't believe all the hype and expect something memorable it simply is not."

This casting ensemble is perfect, and they bring a real sense and tone to the screen to recreate the Ward-Eklund family. All of the performances were brilliant, from Mark Wahlberg's tough charisma, Melissa Leo's smart timing, and Amy Adams' breakthrough acting. But, it's Christian Bale that deserves the Oscar win for his role as Micky's crack-addicted brother. He brought a powerful tone to his performance, and he has a lot of strength in his heart. Also, director David O. Russell is a director that really set the mood for this film and deserved the Best Director nomination in the process. The film showed how to fit in with the flow, and go out there and become a champion. That's what lifted the spirits of viewers when watching these boxing flicks. It's entertaining, uplifting, and heartwarming. From start to finish, this one of cinema's best boxing movies ever put on screen.

","""The Fighter"" is a true story about an Irish boxer by the name of Mickey Ward played by Mark Wahlberg. He is trained by his brother and a former boxer in his own right named Dick Eklund played by Christian Bale. This movie brings you along from the early years in Lowell, Massachusetts, through Dick Eklunds personal battle with drugs. In this inspirational story, you have a fighter trying to reclaim their family name and to give their town something they can be proud of.<br/><br/>Mickey Ward soon finds himself struggling with an ineffective trainer in his brother. Dicky gets put in jail by committing a crime that soon makes Mickey have to face either giving up his chances of making a career in boxing or leaving his mother, Alice (Melissa Leo), and his brother Dicky.

","Wow, I only wish that I didn't wait so long to rent this film. The film is a true story about the rise of an obscure boxer and his brother, a past boxing champ who now trains him, but has a crack addiction. I usually don't like ""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg and I think his acting is boring at best, unless his playing a character from Boston and the character is The Fighter was just perfect for him. Christian Bale plays his brother, a crack addicted trainer who continues to relive his boxing match with Suger Ray Leanord. The film explores the dysfunctional family that Mark's character has to live with and his admiration and love for his brother. Christian Bale nailed this role, seriously. Also, Amy Adams plays Mark's girlfriend and she also nailed the role. The performance is amazing. The story is sad, funny and inspiring. Marky Mark also executive produced this and what a fantastic film...nice job."
"michaelRokeefe","8","0","3","13 April 2011"," Dysfunctional family that puts up a good fight.
","Mark Wahlberg, after years of trying to get this movie made, convinces his friend David O. Russell to direct him in this raw, hard punching boxing movie. Wahlberg grew up idolizing one-time junior welterweight champ ""Irish"" Micky Ward and now plays him on the big screen. Ward comes from a dysfunctional, but close-knit family that lived and breathed boxing. Micky's half-brother Dicky Eklund(Christian Bale),was in charge of training him, his mother Alice(Melissa Leo)managed him and Charlene(Amy Adams)is the girlfriend given credit in helping to open his eyes toward a better chance at a championship bout. The fight scenes are so real you almost feel the slinging sweat. You can't say this story about the ""Pride of Lowell"" is candy-coated. It is obvious Wahlberg trained long and hard to play this role. Bale is incredible as the fighter past his prime with more current interest in drugs and clowning around. Adams is stunning in a straight-forward way and easily capable of stealing scenes. Others in the cast: Jack McGee, Jeanna Lamia, Jill Quigg, Melissa McMeekin and Mickey O'Keefe. You may have seen more boxing movies than you can count; but not like this one."

","When someone mentions a boxing movie, what titles spring to mind? ROCKY is probably the first, some would say RAGING BULL (though I think it's overrated), and hopefully some day THE FIGHTER will come to everyone's mind. In many ways, it's not just another boxing movie. Sure there are scenes of Mark Wahlberg boxing, but a larger portion of the movie focuses on the strained relationships between his character and his mixed up family. The dynamics between Wahlberg and Christian Bale are believable to anyone who's had a sibling. Recently, I saw 127 Hours which (to date) featured the best performance of James Franco. And in both cases, I found myself asking the same question: What does it take for James Franco or Mark Wahlberg to get an Oscar? In both cases, here are two fine actors who have gone out there, played loads of roles over the years, and yet when Oscar time comes around, they're mostly forgotten. Thankfully, both were noticed this year, but why did it take so long? Watching Mark Wahlberg in THE FIGHTER, one can't help but feel for his character who's had to live in the shadow of his older brother. Their mother treats the older brother like royalty, despite the fact he's a drug-addicted has-been. When Mark finally decides to break away from the family and strike out on his own, you want to see him overcome the bitterness and scorn. So, even though the movie is a boxing movie, the real fighting comes between Mark and his family. The struggle to break free to live your life is definitely worth fighting for."

","The Fighter is a brilliant film, and for me one of the best movies of 2010 along with The King's Speech, The Social Network and Toy Story 3. The editing and cinematography are top-drawer especially as are the compellingly atmospheric score, the brilliant direction which seamlessly blends gritty realism and the theme of fighting-against-the-odds as seen in the finale and the script which has a lot of class and heart with the odd peppering of humour and good humour at that.<br/><br/>What made The Fighter were the boxing fight sequences and the acting. The fight sequences are very kinetic, energetic and very exciting. And thanks to the quality of the direction and script, not to mention the acting, the characters are very credible and genuine. The acting is brilliant. Mark Wahlberg gives his best performance so far and provides the heart of the film, while Amy Adams is completely different from her Enchanted persona being more crude and less infectious in a cute way. But the best performances come from Christian Bale, who is just astonishing, and Melissa Leo who is equally a revelation.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a knockout of a film and one of the year's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","Hard-hitting (haha) drama about much more than boxing. It's about making tough choices when you need to change directions, perseverance and a family that loves each other even if they have some pretty crazy ways of showing it.<br/><br/>This movie had me tense and on-the-edge... I had no idea going in what to expect, and there was no pre-ordained Hollywood ending. The fighting was realistic, although never took over the movie. It's not a boxing film, it's a story-driven look at two under-privileged brothers fighting for honor, to provide for their family and to do something with their lives.<br/><br/>You might have heard of Christian Bale's Oscar-winning acting in this movie, and it is worthy. Mark Wahlberg is also great in a less demanding acting role (but more demanding physically!) The supporting cast rounds out the realistic and important family dynamics... excellent all around.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film! It raises a number of issues and gets you thinking. What opportunities have you let go because of perceived ""duties."" Or are you ruining your life with drugs? If you're in a messed up family situation, is there something positive to grab on to? Can you find redeeming qualities and benefit from that? There is a lot of heart behind the hurt, and I know I'll watch it again someday. Just terrific."
"cbrueggemeyer","9","0","2","29 March 2011"," The Fighter Film Review
","The Fighter is the story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, and his unlikely journey to win the world welterweight title. Throughout the story, Ward battles many problems such as a drug-addicted older half-brother with illusions of grandeur. He also battles an extremely unsupportive family of 6 sisters and a self-absorbed mother. The Fighter is a testimony to all the hard work and sacrifice left in the ring by Micky Ward. This film is about overcoming adversity and rising to your full potential. The Fighter is directed by David O. Russell, a moderately inexperienced director who made a name for himself in the 90's with movies such as Three Kings. The character of Micky Ward is played by Mark Wahlberg, a successful actor/producer who has starred in movies such as Boogie Nights and The Other Guys. He has also produced many famous TV series, such as Entourage and In Treatment. In the past, Wahlberg has been criticized for being a minor actor in a major role, such as his role in Boogie Nights. Many critics say that he gives an average performance while other actors steal the show. This was mainly the case in The Fighter. Wahlberg did a great job depicting Ward as a potentially great fighter trapped under the controlling influence of his parents, but he didn't give an award winning performance. He stepped to the side while Christian Bale stole the show. Christian Bale played Dicky Eklund, Mickey Ward's half-brother and mentor. Bale has starred in many great movies, including The Prestige, American Psycho, and The Dark Knight. Dicky Eklund is a character with many problems, all caused by his embarrassing loss to Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978. After he lost this fight, Dicky developed a chronic crack edition, and started distorting the facts of his one great moment of fame. Bale gives an outstanding performance as Dicky, and I personally guarantee that he will win Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars on February 27th. Christian Bale prepared for this role by nearly starving himself to death to achieve the gaunt appearance of Dicky Elrund. Bale has been extremely dedicated to this role from the beginning, beating out actors like Matt Damon and Brad Pitt to get the part. Because of this dedication, Bale should definitely win Best Supporting Actor this February."

","Fighter isn't your run of the mill boxing film. It's more of a drama/comedy. I say comedy because there is a lot of humour in the film even though it doesn't intentionally seem like it's trying to be an all out comedy.<br/><br/>I put off watching the film because I thought it was going to be hard work, a serious film about serious people, crack cocaine, family feuds and face pummeling. It's about all those things and yet it manages to stay light despite them. Mark Walberg plays younger brother, and really all he has to do is play it as straight as possible while everyone around him especially Christian Bale bounces off the walls. I think this is the only film I have seen Christian bale play a comedic character. It's a hard thing to do to play a comedic character in a serious film, it threatens the whole vibe and might make a mockery of the drama , but Bale is sincere in his charachterisation and the character comes of as a recognisable real person who is entertaining and yet still believable.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do well to and it is refreshing that the film didn't really go into the whole stupid Rocky thing of boxing like film stars. The boxing, the ring entry, the camera work has a feeling of authenticity and is reminiscent of real fights you might see on a Saturday night.<br/><br/>If there can be any criticism it is that there never really seems to be any emotional depth to it. It seems too light for what it is and all the way through i was thinking that this isn't really heavy drama, this wasn't what i was expecting, but still, overall, it's a great film."

","The Fighter is an actor's film. It's a great story. It's not all about boxing and more so it is about going through an internal struggle and getting by things that hold you back.<br/><br/>This is clearly Christian Bale's movie, and comparing the performance to Colin Firth's in The King's Speech, Bale is miles ahead. Bale astounds the audience playing the role of Dicky Eklund. He is not even acting, it seems. As you watch the real Dicky when the movie ends and credits roll, it looks as though it's the same person in the movie. Bale clearly deserved his praise and awards that he received.<br/><br/>However, there are a lot of things I didn't like in the movie. For one thing, Amy Adams is shown as the ultimate woman in this film and she is consistently showing lots of flesh in the film. I also felt it could have been a little better choreographed for the fight scenes. It wasn't focused on the boxing, however, and perhaps that was one thing that they missed an opportunity at.<br/><br/>If you don't have Christian Bale and Mark Wahlberg, this movie wouldn't be as good. They are the ones who make this movie genius, and that's why this is an actor's movie. Aside from actors, this film has passable cinematography and very subpar boxing choreography. But, the acting boosts it up and makes it one of the better films on the year.<br/><br/>It's not quite on the level as Rocky (maybe Rocky V) but that's because it isn't a boxing movie, really. It's more of a movie about heart and overcoming obstacles and growing as a person. It's not for everyone, but if you like inspirational movies, this is a good one for the time."

"Sylviastel","9","0","1","20 March 2011"," Christian Bale & Melissa Leo's Performances Shine Here!
","The Fighter was truly a story about Lowell, Massachusetts and two brothers. The brothers are played by Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. Bale is the older brother who has achieved some success beating out Sugar Ray Leonard but he became a drug addict and criminal. Bale's Dicky still coaches his little brother, Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. For Wahlberg, this story hits close to home because he's from nearby Dorchester. Anyway, Christian Bale earned his Academy Award as best supporting actor for his performance. There is no trace of his British accent. He simply becomes Dicky and whether you like him or hate him, he makes him simply sympathetic to the viewers. Wahlberg's Micky tries and succeeds at freeing himself from his over-protective mother Alice Ward (played brilliantly by Melissa Leo in her Oscar performance). As Alice Ward, Leo is unrecognizable from past performances. Amy Adams plays the girlfriend, Charlene, who loves Micky but makes him see his crazy family. There are moments in the film that are sweet like when Alice and Dicky are in the car at the crack house and they start singing together. This film has some flaws but not much in it. The police officer and trainer was the actual O'Keefe who had to audition for his role. Jack McGee is fine as the father as well. The sisters were okay but they were always together for most of the time. I couldn't tell one sister from the other. You see Alice Ward was married with Dicky's father and had a couple of his kids. She divorced him and remarried George Ward and added Micky and a few more girls to the family."

","Micky Ward (Walhberg) must deal with his dysfunctional family including loose cannon and drug addict half brother Dicky Eklund (Bale) to attain some prominence in the boxing world.<br/><br/>This is based upon a true story. However, all was not forthright in here; Ward did win some titles in 1996 (WBU Intercontinental Light Welterweight: Title and Defense of it) but the movie never mentions them; Ward's broken right hand was fixed via surgery in a hospital, not thru exercise and pounding his fist in sand as the movie indicates; and it was his brother Dicky who convinced him to continue boxing after the broken hand healed. <br/><br/>But, the movie would have you believe Ward started to win titles when he won the London bout in 2000. (So you didn't like the movie?) Are you kidding, it was great. My only problem is that they don't tell the whole truth in these ""based upon a true story"" stories. <br/><br/>(So you were disappointed then?) Not at all. No, it is still a great movie. You couldn't make this stuff up the way things went. <br/><br/>The dysfunctional family, especially the mother was tough getting used to. (So that ticked you off?) Yes, it did, but although I didn't know the outcome of anything, I figured there had to be a silver lining in here somewhere. (And, was there one?) Yes. <br/><br/>The acting was superb by all. It was like we eavesdropped into a not-so-normal boxing family where everyone went after everyone with fists, pushing and shoving and F-bombs flying all over the place. The dialogue was brutal, and honest. It was great except for the F-bombs.<br/><br/>(So now, how do the Rocky films, and Million Dollar Baby stack up against this one?) Well, those movies were great but this one was true, for the most part; and that makes a difference. <br/><br/>(What about Raging Bull?) OK, I forgot about that one. And, that was a great movie too. <br/><br/>(Christian Bale received a Best Supporting Oscar for his role and you are okay with that?) Absolutely, but for a while there I thought it was his movie and Wahlberg was the supporting guy. I am here to be entertained and I was. A great movie. <br/><br/>(Were the fighting sequences real?)

It wasn't a boxer doing the impossible, it was about the internal strife within a family, the dichotomy of two brother's (one who threw away his shot and the other who didn't want to make the same mistakes). It was about Dicky's journey back from the dark side as much as it was about Mickey's chance to overcome the impossible. More than anything, it was Mark Wahlberg's story and journey to get this film made that emulated the ""Rocky"" tale that the studio tried so hard to push.<br/><br/>I'd just like to lastly point out how awesome it is to see Christian Bale get an Oscar after being ridiculed for his performances in The Dark Knight and Terminator Salvation.

","Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a moderately talented boxer, younger brother of his trainer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), who himself once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard before he ended up addicted to crack.. This film follows Micky's career path, and the influences on it of his brother, his girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) and his mother Alice (Melissa Leo), together with various other figures.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film. A long-term project of Wahlberg's, and based on true events (and presumably brought to the screen with the co-operation of the two brothers, who are featured in some footage as the credits role), it is one of those dramas - there is very little humour here - rooted in run-down urban America featuring what appeared to be a story of a decent man with potential, supported by a good woman, but ultimately doomed to be dragged down by the importance to him of his family, leading to his being let down by his unreliable petty criminal brother who he idealises, and his appalling manager/mother and herd of harridan sisters.<br/><br/>The story didn't go exactly as I expected, however, and I rapidly came to care about Micky so much that I wanted to see things through to the end. The fight sequences were very well staged and, while I wasn't up on my feet cheering, I felt like it.<br/><br/>Looking at performances and award nominations, I felt that Bale was rather too cartoony, particular in the early scenes, and Melissa Leo was rather one-note (if the film was indeed made with the co-operation of the two brothers, then heaven only knows what mother and sisters made of the monsters they are portrayed as).

","I have now seen all 10 films that are nominated for best picture in the up coming Oscars and although The Fighter is not the best of them it certainly has everything you would want in a film about Boxing. This has been compared to Rocky , for obvious reason and i would agree it's pretty similar to the first two movies and in some respect better. The boxing action is far more realistic than in Rocky and the camera work really does make it feel like it is archive footage. This is the boxing equivalent of The Wrestler and it's certainly comparable. All the talk is of Christian Bales performance but i think that's a little harsh on Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg gives a much more natural performance than Bale , who i think tries a little hard at times. Amy Adams is also very good and this is a far cry from her character in Enchanted. If i had to criticise this film i would say it's a little predictable at times and that the director makes that awful mistake that a lot of Americans do and confuses Irish with British in the final scenes but over all this a very entertaining film.

","Russel, along with screenwriters Silver, Tamasy and Johnson do an excellent job with ""The Fighter"". The film was shot on location in Lowell, MA where the story takes place, and being quite familiar with the area, I can tell you that they nailed all the little details. <br/><br/>The performances are sublime, and everyone in the film is perfectly cast. Wahlberg underplays (as the real-life, quiet, big-hearted Mickey Ward), and Bale and Leo take advantage of every moment in their wonderfully-written roles, that are both surely award-winning performances. <br/><br/>It can be easy to forget how crucial proper casting is to a film. Often times, directors are put under enormous pressure to cast bankable stars or supporting players who may not be the right fit for the characters; especially if those characters are the gritty, un-beautiful, working class type (for an example of where this can go terribly wrong, see the lovely Cameron Diaz woefully miscast in Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"". To see where appropriate casting is used wonderfully, watch every episode of HBO's ""The Wire""). Russell clearly used a number of local non-actors in the film as well, and there isn't one in the film that you feel doesn't belong there. <br/><br/>After Russell made few off-kilter, slightly ""unconventional"" films, including I Heart Huckabees and having apparently behaved as a Class-A ass on the set of ""Three Kings"" (if George Clooney's account is accurate), he apparently felt the pressure to deliver a Hollywood-style ""hit"", and he surely did. And yet, there is nothing about this film that feels ""Hollywood"" (a pejorative term that tends to be related to something sappy, sentimental, and extremely false in it's feeling and execution). <br/><br/>One who studies boxing might think the fight scenes were a bit over-the-top, but that's the way the real Mickey Ward fought; able to withstand an enormous amount of punishment. <br/><br/>The story is clear, engaging, touching, funny, and honest. Which is proof that you can actually make a gritty docudrama that is entertaining for an audience. You just need a great script, great actors, perfect casting, and a highly-skilled director willing to take some chances. Piece of cake. <br/><br/>Speaking of cake, there's only point where the writers tip their hand that they may not have grown up in the northeast. At one point, Charlene asks Dickie ""what's that blue stuff on your arm"", to which he replies ""(cake) Icing."" Now, as any true Bostonian knows it's never ""icing"", but ""Frawstin!"""

For a film like this it is very difficult to make it completely unpredictable, yet while ""The Fighter"" is in a way conventional, it is also unpredictable many times. David O. Russell brings a needed dose of realism to the boxing genre, downplaying the underdog nature of Micky's true story and focusing on the relationships that push him through and hold him back all throughout his journey toward the welterweight title. The cast is great but Bale certainly deserve best Academy award's supporting role. It's an excellent movie overall, not to be missed. Quite possibly one of the best boxing films ever made.

Besides the constant foul language, it turns out to be a modern-day like ""Rocky"" film with a totally dysfunctional, filthy mouthed family. <br/><br/>In a supporting role, Christian Bale, quite effective, is like a washed-up Rocky Balboa with a drug problem. Mark Wahlberg is his brother who is trying to get it together and become a winner in the ring,something that Bale was unable to do.<br/><br/>Melissa Leo, in an Oscar nominated performance, steals the film as the common mother, with her abusive language, constant smoking, but love of family. She is almost equally matched by Amy Adams. Adams sheds her film roles as free spirit or nun, as the foul-mouthed college drop-out girlfriend of Wahlberg.<br/><br/>The film shows that despite the conflicts between these two ladies, who really know how to use profanity in style, all comes together for Wahlberg's opportunity for the title. Wahlberg, who surprisingly, was not Oscar nominated, delivers a riveting performance.<br/><br/>Don't be surprised to see Bale and Leo walking down the red carpet on Oscar night. Poor Amy Adams. As in ""Doubt,"" she is again facing a nominee in the same film."
"napierslogs","7","0","4","30 January 2011"," Enjoyable interactions with funny lines but fails to deliver anything meaningful
","Dicky Ecklund (Christian Bale) is ""the pride of Lowell, Massachusetts"", at least he still believes that. Most people just see him as a crack addict. HBO is making a documentary about him, but ""The Fighter"" is about his brother, Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and trying to become a champion boxer.<br/><br/>""The Fighter"" has a slightly different feel to it than most gritty boxing movies both because of Bale's performance and because of the amount of comedy delivered with all the lines. Lowell is also the type of town that producer Wahlberg grew up in so the characterizations would have been accurate. But it is still exactly like every gritty boxing movie, and although I was relieved it had comedy, it was an awfully strange mix between comedy and drama. They made light of situations that one scene later or earlier they had taken seriously. Any emotional message that they were trying to deliver was lost.<br/><br/>The interactions among all the characters were quite enjoyable, especially between Micky's ""MTV"" girlfriend Charlene (Amy Adams) and his mother and sisters, and between Dicky and his mother. The performances were great with a wonderful quick wit and fairly interesting interactions. ""The Fighter"" is a good film but it doesn't have the meaning or impact that something like ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) has."
"lee_eisenberg","8","0","1","27 January 2011"," I just recently saw ""Belle Epoque""
","Having seen ""The King's Speech"" yesterday and ""The Fighter"" today, I'd say that the latter isn't quite as good as the former, but I still strongly recommend both movies. The latter is about boxer Micky Ward, and his half-brother Dicky Eklund.<br/><br/>The half-brothers come from the economically depressed town of Lowell, Massachusetts. Dicky had gone up against Sugar Ray Leonard, but has since been in and out of jail, battling crack cocaine addiction. Now, Micky is trying to have a boxing career. But it's bound to be a tough journey.<br/><br/>This movie is very much about the characters. Practically all the characters are unpleasant in some way. Mark Wahlberg shows Micky to be someone whose experiences have forced him to always have a nasty side, though he always tries to do the right thing. Christian Bale shows Dicky to be a real burnout, but who truly wants what's best for his half-brother. Amy Adams plays what must be the first gritty role of her career, as Micky's bar-tending love interest Charlene Fleming. Probably the most intense character in the movie is Melissa Leo as Micky and Dicky's mother Alice: she's lived such a hard life that she's nearly incapable of being warm towards anyone.<br/><br/>Does the movie have any problems? Well, the boxing matches themselves seemed pretty routine for what we see in movies. Alice's hostility towards everyone around her came across as excessive - maybe absurd - in a few scenes, but it was clear that this was the only way that she knew how to be, and she wanted the best for her sons.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Fighter"" is definitely a movie that I recommend. Like I said, probably not the year's best movie, but I do think that at least it would probably be justified to give Adams or Leo an Oscar. Really good."
"Bunuel1976","7","0","3","22 January 2011"," THE FIGHTER (David O. Russell, 2010) ***
","More than any other type of sport, the Boxing movie has steadily attracted the attention of Oscar voters – with the most successful examples obviously being ROCKY (1976) and MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), since they surprisingly ended up walking away with the top prizes. However, in the vast majority of the cases, genre conventions were merely employed as a spring-board for character development – notably RAGING BULL (1980) – and this latest entry certainly follows in that tradition (being, for one thing, similarly inspired by the career of a real-life fighter).<br/><br/>The project apparently started with star/producer Mark Wahlberg; interestingly, one of the myriad executive producers here is Darren Aronofsy who, not only directed the definitive film about another violent sport i.e. THE WRESTLER (2008), but has been competing with David O. Russell all through the current awards season for his own film about yet one more 'tortured' discipline, ballet, in BLACK SWAN (2010)! Incidentally, while Christian Bale and Melissa Leo have been garnering the biggest praise from among the cast, I found their performances (he as the protagonist's washed-out boxer-turned-junkie of an elder brother, still riding on the wave of his greatest match, and she as his harridan of a chain-smoking mother, who blindingly believes she knows what is best for her boys) grating and overly-mannered, so that I was more impressed with Wahlberg's own quiet turn and Amy Adams' compelling portrayal of his tough bar-maid girlfriend.<br/><br/>By the way, I guess one relates to the notion of 'family as a sacred institution' like it is depicted here (and in many another film in various genres) based on his own experiences; as for myself, I have never bought into it and, if this may pre-condition the final assessment of any given film, that is just too bad! As ever with this type of crowd-pleasing fare, the boxing sequences themselves are excitingly edited for maximum impact (particularly the two in which Wahlberg emerges victorious) – but equally important is the choice of soundtrack, and it does not disappoint in this area either (including my own favorite Aerosmith song from the 1970s, ""Back In The Saddle"")."
"halfpintofpain","Null","0","1","21 January 2011"," Outstanding
","Gritty, real, the uplifting story of a blue collar hero. Lowell Massachusetts is the real setting for this movie, and its clapboard row houses and deserted mills are punctuated with corner stores and bars. This is where ""Irish"" Mickey Ward made his rise to boxing immortality. Plagued by personal demons and a oft misguided family including half brother Dickey Ecklund Ward, a once up and coming boxer who was known as ""the pride of Lowell"" and who's claim to fame is having knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard. Ecklund now battles with drug addiction and criminal activity while making a poor attempt to act as brother Mickeys trainer. This is a real life Rocky, a movie to lift you up out of your seat and make you feel alive."
"sombuddha-kundu","7","0","2","12 January 2011"," More drama than boxing!!!!!
","It a good character study film. More of a intense drama than boxing. Whalberg is getting really good in these roles. Hope he continuous this form.<br/><br/>The screenplay does a really good job in making the story come alive. Also the acting of Bale is beyond doubt impressive as always. The supporting roles were good especially of the mother.<br/><br/>However would have been great if it had a little more boxing action. Also had a somewhat abrupt ending if i may say so.<br/><br/>But none the less a very good movie, especially if you are a Bale fan.<br/><br/>My rating 4/5"
"dtucker86","Null","0","3","12 January 2011"," I should have been a contender
","People have compared this movie to Rocky in its reviews. Its only like Rocky during its uplifting end when Ward wins the title. Before that, this is a movie you can practically smell from your seat. Its a smell of sweat, stale cigarette smoke, cheap booze and utter despair. Except for Wahlberg and his girlfriend, I really didn't like a single character in this movie. I was angry at Wahlbergs character a little for the way he let his stupid, trashy family rule him and the way the enabled and covered up for that loser brother of his. This is a man who knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard and then let his personal demons bring him down about as low as possible. I think the most pathetic scene in the film was where his brother thought HBO was doing a documentary on his ""comeback"" when they were really doing a documentary on how he had messed up his life. I can tell that Wahlberg really worked out for the fight scenes but they are not as good as Rocky, basically he just gets the stuffing beat out of him before landing one lucky punch. Maybe they should have had Sylvester Stallone handle that part of the film."
"davidrcastro1","10","0","1","9 January 2011"," Best fighting movie, period.
","I've always been a fan of fighting movies, especially the Rocky Series, but this has to be the best fighting movie I've ever seen. I was impressed by Mark Wahlberg's performance, but Christian Bale put on one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. The Story was very real, and cliché free. I remember wishing I could walk back into the theater and watch the whole thing over again. Everything about this movie is perfect, including the fight scenes. The emotions portrayed by the characters made me feel like if I were watching real people through a giant window, and the direction was truly amazing. I give this movie a ten out of ten because I can't give it more, but it definitely deserves an Oscar Nomination for best picture, and for Best Supporting Actor Christian Bale."
"Dragonsouls","8","0","1","4 January 2011"," This Film is hard to forget
","I rarely go to the movies anymore, saving my money for the good films, and this one was one of them. The critics got it right with The Fighter, it really is one of those old fashioned films. It feels like an Independent film, not a Paroumount Production. The direction felt like that of a Clint Eastwood film, each character fleshed out to the fullest, even the ones with just a couple of scenes, they each fit into to the story in their own ways.<br/><br/>What made the movie great was the performances. All around, especially by Christian Bale, I really can't help but wonder about this man. He is a fine actor and I always knew that, but after Terminator 4 I wondered about his future. I thought money got to him, but he's back to form, and this was his best performance since The Machinist and The Prestige. It's as if Bale always plays a lunatic in all his films, he's just that type of actor, but He just doesn't play a yelling and insane lunatic in this film, he plays an eccentric and emotional role. Even comedic at times. And he really molded into the role and put his heart into it. I didn't even know it was him at times, the weight loss added to it as well. It's amazing how this man loses and gains weight from film to film.<br/><br/>Melissa Leo was phenomenal ! Where did she come from? Great emotive acting from her part, I'm now a fan. And Amy Adams also has a great future in this business, what a job by her as well, never has a movie been full of so many great performances by the whole cast. Oddly enough Mark Wahlberg was the only one who was forgettable in this film. He wasn't bad, but nothing outstanding. His fighting was also shoddy, the choreography was poor in my opinion. He didn't convince me in the ring, Hilliary Swank was more convincing in Million Dollar Baby. Just like DeNiro was in Raging Bull and Will Smith in Ali. They actually looked like boxers, Wahlberg looked as if he never threw a punch in his life.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film, even though it's predictable as all True Stories are. The screenplay was solid ,as were the performances. A contender for multiple Oscar nominations."
"PWNYCNY","10","0","2","2 January 2011"," Two brothers; both champions.
","What a great movie! The movie starts rather unspectacularly but soon builds into a strong, compelling dramatic story about two incredibly strong characters, one of whom is sick, who stick with each other and help each other overcome their personal obstacles. Mark Wahlberg and Melissa Leo are outstanding, but the this movie is a showcase for Christiam Bale whose performance is remarkable bordering on incredible. Mr. Bale portrays a character who by any reasonable standard should be detested yet by the end of movie is worthy of admiration. The movie also provides a candid and powerful portrayal of the dysfunctional family and how the fighter copes with these issues to achieve success. For the fighter is not a wanton punching machine. He actually cares and the movie shows it. One is fascinated by the nature of the family dynamics and how they effect the main characters. Instead of being corny or contrived, the story is presented in a straightforward manner that lays out the issues. The character of Mickey Ward is heroic, that of his brother sublime. Both deserve respect, both became champions, one in the ring, the other in life."
"Special-K88","Null","0","2","30 December 2010"," some limitations here and there yet still a good film
","David O. Russell presents the true story of 'Irish' Micky Ward, a gritty, two-bit boxer who strived to beat the odds and become world champion. The story focuses specifically on his relationships over the years with his troubled older brother and trainer Dicky—a former boxer who battled a drug-addiction and frequent run-ins with the law, his mother and manager Alice—who always felt that she knew what was best for him, and his girlfriend Charlene—who sought to steer him away from his detrimental family ties. Genre is familiar so the story elements aren't all that surprising, but it's still compelling, and bolstered by solid direction, believable fight scenes, and first-rate performances. Bale—in yet another memorable, disparate role—is outstanding, Wahlberg a perfect fit, Adams excellent in the kind of role you'd never expect to see her in. Leo also scores as the hard-nosed matriarch of Bale and Wahlberg's family. ***"
"monkeylovindodo","10","0","4","28 December 2010"," Why this movie is not rated higher with more gross is beyond me.
","I restrain my anger from stupidity. I've just had an argument with friend about our views of these movies. With that said if you can or choose to be taken on a ride with films direction of emotions you need to allow this one a chance.<br/><br/>This is much more than just another boxing movie. This film was a thrill to watch. If you cannot recall a time when the last film you've watched angered you when it was supposed to and build you when it asked then you must watch this one.<br/><br/>If Christian Bale ever raised doubt in your mind as to his caliber as an actor, this film utterly destroys those thoughts. Mark Walhberg clearly put a lot of time into this movie. His passion for this story isn't hard to see in his character throughout the film.<br/><br/>I refuse to say anything else in fear of doing the film an injustice by not bring up the appropriate topics.<br/><br/>My last 2 comments about this movie. It will work it's way to the shelf of every man's collection. If you have an ounce of testosterone, then this is a must see."
"burningreview","9","0","2","28 December 2010"," The Fighter is the story of a small town boxing ""star"" who is trying to make his comeback as his brother's trainer.
","The Fighter is really a story about family. Mark Wahlberg's character struggles with the craziness of a large, loud-mouthed family and trying to fulfill his dreams. Throughout the movie he works to determine if victory is better with or without your crazy family.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very impressed with this film. I believe the acting stood out above any other element. However, the story is exciting, hilarious, and emotional. Plus who can't relate to a little bit of family drama. But as award season approaches, I expect to see more individual actor awards rather than overall film awards.These amazing portrayals make a real-life tale come alive on the screen.<br/><br/>See It!

"uofmsuperfan12","9","0","2","27 December 2010"," Human realism elevates beyond boxing
","In what could have easily been just another underdog story ""Fighter"" gets audiences pumped and feeling connected to life-like characters. Many of the major players in the movie, Wahlberg and Adams in particular, are out of their normal role. Adams, featured mainly in ""chick flicks"" shows her gritty and sexy side. Wahlberg finally breaks out of the action role to show a very real character the audience members can't but help to support. Bale, however, steals the show. Taking a short break from Batman, he portrays Wahlberg's older, crack-addicted, ex-boxer, brother. Bale captures the mannerisms of not just a stereotypical junkie but of Dickie Eklund himself. This film pulls the focus away from an underdog sports story to one of a family struggling to hold itself together and its members coming to terms with the truth."
"Jackpollins","9","0","2","23 December 2010"," The Fighter serves as an entertaining, feel good film
","Every once in a while a movie comes along that exceeds my expectations so far my jaw actually drops. The Fighter is one of those films. I must say I am not a fan of boxing or any of the actors in this film except Amy Adams, but I loved this movie. The Fighter is the true story of Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a boxer who was taught everything by his younger brother Dicky (Christian Bale.) Now, I must point something out before you go see this film. What I must point out is that if you are grossed out by unnaturally skinny people, do not see this movie. Bale lost a ton of weight for his role and is now close to an anorexic's weight (just a couple more pounds to lose and he'll be there.) That being said, everyone, including Wahlberg, Bale, Adams, and Melissa Leo turn in excellent performances. The film's a bit slow at times, juggling the romance between Wahlberg and Adams and Wahlberg's boxing career quite heavy handedly. Most times heavy handedness would be a bad thing, but this time it's a good thing if, like myself, you don't mind it. This film is not for everybody, but if you like well made films and don't mind skinny people or a bit slow of a movie, then go see The Fighter because it will satisfy you."
