","As a South African who saw this film on Friday morning, I can tell you you the entertaining, inspiring and enjoyable ""Invictus"" exceeded all my expectations. <br/><br/>It really is a true story of epic proportions yet it's told with an intimate feel, and it is at least 98% accurate to the events of the time. Clint gets all the big details and so many of the little details right, but he never goes over the top. He directs with minimum fuss and achieves maximum effect, just letting the powerful story unfold without getting in its way.<br/><br/>I watched the 1995 Rugby World Cup and saw Madiba come out in the Springbok jersey. It was a wondrous sight. And when Joel Stransky slotted that drop kick over in the dying minutes and the Boks won, I wept and cheered along with everyone else. After the match millions of South African - of all races - celebrated. It was an amazing time. It was the birth of the ""Rainbow Nation"". Nelson Mandela is the greatest and most beloved of all South Africans. The man is a living legend, but so human and real. When he was President he brought hope to all South Africans, white and black. We, in my country, will never stop loving this incredible man. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman did South Africa and our beloved Madiba proud. Francois Pienaar is also an amazing South African, an intelligent, big-hearted rugby played who always led by example, and Matt Damon's performance as him was superb. I was glued to the screen for every second of the film's running time (I didn't even move from my seat until the final credit rolled and the house lights came on), and I was moved to tears on several occasions. The final scene was especially touching.<br/><br/>Freeman's performance was magical and I can see him getting as Oscar nomination. If you think his Mandela is too cool to be true, think again. Mandela really is this cool. A brave and intelligent man whose courage and strength of character should serve as an example to people all over the world. After being unjustly imprisoned for nearly 30 years by a cruel and repressive regime, he emerged to run a country and teach its people the meaning of forgiveness and reconciliation.<br/><br/>I thoroughly recommend the authentically detailed, historically accurate ""Invictus"" to film lovers, Eastwood fans, Nelson Mandela fans and sports fans everywhere in the world. South Africans would be crazy to miss this excellent film, but it deserves to be a hit all over the globe. Let's hope it is.<br/><br/>Viva Clint Eastwood, viva Morgan Freeman, viva Madiba.<br/><br/>PS. I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director.<br/><br/>Of the films Eastwood has directed, my favorites, in no particular order, are ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"",""Bird"" and ""Invictus"". Yes, it's really that good. ""Invictus"" is another winner from Clint. He just seems to get better with age. What a creative roll he is currently on.<br/><br/>PPS. ""Invictus"" is one of the best sporting movies I have ever seen. But it's also about more than sport."
"ClaytonDavis","9","196","252","4 December 2009"," One of Clint's Best...
","In surely one of his lightest and straight-forward works of his career, Clint Eastwood has achieved one of the most inspirational films of the year with his new film, Invictus.<br/><br/>Starring Academy Award Winners Morgan Freeman as South African President Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Rugby Captain Francois Pienaar, Invictus is a picture full of emotion, magnetism, and revelation. What critics and audiences may be deceived by is belief that this is THE Nelson Mandela biopic which it is not. It is the story of Nelson Mandela's first years as President of the culturally separated country South Africa in 90's. In a way to unify his people, Mandela used the country's love for Rugby to connect the whites and the blacks. As their record has been less than impressive, no one expects anything notable from the Springboks. Mandela taps the captain of the team to rally his troops and surge into battle for the greater good of his country.<br/><br/>Everything about Invictus works on so many degrees of the medium based on the book ""Playing the Enemy."" The film never comes off as too pretentious or egotistical; it requires nothing more from the viewer than an open mind and heart. Eastwood directs the film perfectly, laying back when he needs to, never pushing the subject matter or shoving it down our throats. He utilizes all the skills we've come to love about his earlier works in Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, and Letters from Iwo Jima. The use of light shows a character' s vulnerability inhabiting their souls or a score by Kyle Eastwood that offers both zeal and subtlety during a rugby match. <br/><br/>Cinematographer Tom Stern hits another one out of the park, catching all the fury and apprehension of all the different elements of this strenuous time. Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film with the perfect amount of precision and friction. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as Mandela is a wonderful charmer, showing the man's most hostile yet tranquil behaviors. Not necessarily the most engulfed characterization seen on film this year as Freeman's accent comes in and out of remission, but it's a tremendous performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. <br/><br/>Matt Damon, showing himself as one of the best working actors today, doesn't have enough of the character depth and arc to carry the picture. Damon's performance doesn't allow him to really go anywhere. It's a superb turn, with a great accent inhabitance, that warrants credit where the credit is due. However, Damon requires nothing more than a little motivational speaking and responsive humility.<br/><br/>Invictus, is one of the best pictures of the year, standing in the ranks of one of the best sports films of the decade. This is the type of film that Oscar will likely be all over and fall in love with. I concur. <br/><br/>****/****"
"wolverinesforever","8","71","87","12 December 2009"," Morgan Freeman shines in Clint Eastwood's solid drama
","Set in the early to mid 90's, Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" covers the first year of Nelson Mandela's presidency and how he pushed the nation's rugby team, led by captain Francois Pienaar, to achieve World Cup glory. However, Mandela's backing of the rugby team splits many hairs, as the ""Sprinboks"" have come to be a symbol of apartheid for millions of South Africans, making Mandela risk the very base that pushed him into office. He must also deal with personal security, his exhaustive schedule, and the strains on his personal life.<br/><br/>As much as I respect Morgan Freeman, I was concerned that his presence would be distracting, that I would be seeing him instead of Nelson Mandela. I shouldn't have worried. Freeman completely immerses himself into the role and gives one of the best performances of the year. Not only are his accent and tone of voice quite good, but he brings a true 3-dimensionality to the role. Compare, for example, him having tea with Francois, to talking with his family, and to making a political speech. Freeman nailed every facet of Mandela's life.<br/><br/>Damon also excels as Pienaar, the solid enough rugby player who must do more than just lead by example for his team. The screenplay, adapted by Anthony Peckham, doesn't offer many narrative surprises, but it does do a good job examining not only the strife South Africa was in when Mandela was elected, but also the value of the team to the entire nation. Eastwood wisely plays the material straight. Though the material may seem familiar, the performances by Damon and especially Freeman are what elevate this tale into a solid and even uplifting drama."

","Originally, I thought this movie was going to be a biopic on the life of Nelson Mandela. To some degree, it is a biography on Mr. Mandela, but the film's main focus is on his idea of inspiring a country that is drawn to crime, violence, and poverty (after years of Apartheid) to a glimpse of hope via the nation's rugby team. <br/><br/>Without a doubt, this is the perfect role for Morgan Freeman. I will note that his accent comes and goes throughout the film, but he nails the role down. He is not overly dramatic nor does he just read the script. He becomes the man. Morgan Freeman is easily one of my favorite actors because he never plays himself. He always makes himself into the character he's assigned to. He'll definitely receive the Best Actor nom, and hopefully, Morgan can finally win the Oscar he so desperately deserves.<br/><br/>Regarding Matt Damon as the rugby coach (Francois Pienaar), he too immerses himself into his role. He even maintains a solid accent. However, the sympathy of the film is aimed towards Mandela than it is to Francois. The other cast members (none of which I recognized) also gave decent, believable performances. <br/><br/>As with the plot, it is predictable, something we've seen beforeunderdog overcomes impossible odds, yet screenwriter Anthony Peckham throws in many important themes that may seem all to familiar, but is nonetheless eye-opening such as: forgiveness, unity, and determination to do what is right. Racial tension between the whites and blacks is dominant in the movie, particularly between the black and white security guards, but the film's point, as well as Mandela's goal, is to put our differences aside and work together as one.<br/><br/>The movie isn't just about a rugby game, but rather organizing a nation to a success. It may be considered a wise political move on Mandela's part, but as Morgan says to his aid, ""It is a human calculation"". People need inspiration in order to change and to do good. These themes are what make it a good film. It also makes it a different kind of sports movie. <br/><br/>Tom Stern's cinematography is wonderful, and this time, he doesn't make the movie all sepia tone like in ""Letters of Iwo Jima"" or ""Changeling"" and I congratulate the editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach once again for making each shot beautifully seamless and well structured for the storyline. The music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is not just a pretty tone that plays along with the movie, but it adds some oomph and emotion. I particularly love their choice of African vocals, for it not only makes the film feel more real, but it is absolutely beautiful to listen to. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has done another great movie. Not only has he captured the themes of the story, but also the poverty of South Africa as well as the intense rugby sequences. There are some powerful scenes in this movie, as well as some intense and suspenseful ones, and even ones that'll make you smile. For the first time in a movie for this year, I actually cried. Not because of sadness, but from joy.<br/><br/>""Invictus"" is an inspiring film. Some back-story could have been added to the characters and the first act could have been faster, but overall, I enjoyed this film. ""Invictus"" proves that it doesn't take special effects and big action sequences to make a great film. It is excellent to see one of our great old directors to recognize this, and display it so wonderfully without being preachy about it."
"C-Younkin","8","107","136","9 December 2009"," Strong themes overcome predictable plotting
","Morgan Freeman's made a career out of playing inspirational second fiddles who always steal the movie. Now with Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"", we finally get to see this amazing actor take front and center and run with it. The movie, based on a John Carlin novel about the event that changed South Africa, fits Freeman like a glove and it's hard to imagine he's not a front-runner for that lead actor Oscar he has so deserved for so long now.<br/><br/>He plays Nelson Mandela as a born leader, an authoritative yet empathetic uniter who preached forgiveness and looked for common ground when elected president of South Africa. His election caused unrest among whites, and blacks still had hard feelings for years-worth of oppression. The one thing he saw that could unite was the Rugby team, a shamefully rag-tag bunch facing extinction because many still saw the team as a left-over from apartheid. Mandela knew ending the team would mean more unrest among white Rugby fans so instead he presented a challenge to team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon); win the world cup,unite us.<br/><br/>Do they? It's all predictably plotted and there are times where you wish Eastwood had employed an announcer to explain what's happening on the Rugby field but the great themes of forgiveness, unity, and determination make this a sports movie well worth seeing. There are really wonderful elements here. The relationship between Mandela's white and black security detail. The Rugby team reaching out to the community by going to the slums and teaching kids how to play. Pienaar's visit to Mandela's prison cell to understand the man's courage. The people of South Africa rallying into something of a community. And the bond between Mandela and Pienaar, very well played by both Freeman and Damon, of two men looking for their country's pride, it's center, and it's heart. By the final Rugby match, the movie has built up such good-will that any predictability or confusion on screen becomes an afterthought to the joy and excitement on display. Eastwood's film shows how sports can unify people, a simple yet inspirational and lovable message that should leave audiences cheering."
"artzau","10","97","123","11 December 2009"," Just one great film
","People forget that Nelson Mandela came to power at a time when his country was bitterly divided. There was the bitter experience that white South Africans saw in their neighboring countries,i.e., Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe and other nations where the White colonialist had been replaced by Black African politicians and a stable government had been replaced by corrupt, self-serving regimes where those in power feathered their nests after seizing the assets of their former White citizens and placed all their friends in positions of authority with the result of the country going to the dogs. The scene where the Afrikaaner newspaper remarks, ""Mendela can get elected but can he run a country,"" and the superb Morgan Freeman remarks to his bodyguard that the headline raises a good point.<br/><br/>In a sense, this film is about Mandela. The rugby team becomes a metaphor of what he faced when ascending to the presidency, a nation divided. Noting that the Black South Africans were cheering for the opposition in the face of the old Apartheid guard whose love of rugby unified them. It's easy to forget that there was a great division among White South Africans, i.e., the descendants of the Boers, Afrikaaners, and the rest. There was even a middle ground with the ""Coloreds,"" Asian South Africans, being caught between these two worlds and there were bitter rivalries among the competing African political interest groups as well.<br/><br/>Mandela's focus on reviving the national rugby team and making it a symbol of a new united nation homes in on the role of Matt Damon, an Afrikaaner who's the captain of the team. Francois is the catalyst that makes this story work and Damon, the rugged Mick from Boston, does a fantastic job showing the transition from hopelessness to hope as many White South Africans felt at that time. The wonderful thing about this film is its touching on all the levels. It goes beyond being merely the story of a single man or group of men. Sure, we love a ""feel good"" movie and of course we love an ""underdog can win"" flick, but this film works works because its about people working together to rebuild something new for everybody.<br/><br/>The film reeks with great moments: Pienaar visiting the cell where Mandela spent more than 20 years of his life, thinking and planning; The New Zealand Rugby team doing their Maori threat dance before the match; the jet buzzing the field before the game-- and so on. See it. Enjoy it. And, don't forget, it's a bit of history. Romanticized? Somewhat. Mandela wasn't able to solve all of South Africa's big problems, but he did one bang-up job for the Springboks."
"eastbergholt2002","8","105","134","12 December 2009"," Freeman is great as Mandela
","Invictus is an enjoyable film, Morgan Freeman is great as Mandela and it's an inspiring story. The movie revolves around the 1995 Rugby World Cup and Mandela's attempt to unite South Africa behind its rugby team. Mandela develops a relationship with team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)playing the role of mentor and motivational coach. <br/><br/>Although it's well-made and worth watching. As a rugby fan I was a little disappointed with the action on the field although most ordinary film-goers may not notice. I am not convinced the director (Clint Eastwood) really understands the game and the actors hired to play the Springboks didn't really look the part. At 5'10"" Matt Damon is a little small to play the 6'3"" and 240 lb Pienaar. Pienaar was a popular charmer with a ready smile and a real ambassador for South African rugby. Damon still seemed to be playing Jason Bourne. It was an intense performance but it wasn't how I remembered Pienaar.<br/><br/>South Africa had not been allowed to play in previous world cup tournaments and the years of isolation had left the Springboks uncompetitive. They were seeded ninth coming into the tournament but exceed expectations by reaching the final. The action focuses on the final match with New Zealand. New Zealand had an amazing wing (running back) in the 20 year old Jonah Lomu who at 6'5"" and 265 pounds seemed unstoppable. South Africa really were the underdogs. It was also the only time that the All Blacks have managed to reach the final since 1987. They usually get beat by the French (1999, 2007) or Australia (1991 and 2003)in the quarters or semis. <br/><br/>Overall it's nice for rugby to finally receive some recognition from Hollywood, because it's a major global sport. It's a good film.<br/><br/>I discovered that ""Invictus"" is a short poem by the English poet William Ernest Henley. The title is Latin for ""unconquered"". It was first published in 1875."

","Clint Eastwood manages to top himself with this true story of how the new president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, used the national rugby team foray into the World Cup to unite his country after years of apartheid. Eastwood’s soft touch provides a timely but not heavy-handed message about hope and change that probably won’t be lost on American audiences. The result is beautiful, exhilarating, and wholly inspirational.<br/><br/>Mandela, played with effortless dignity by Morgan Freeman, is fresh out of prison and desperate for a way to rebuild his country, which has been torn asunder by the heinous policies of apartheid. Mandela comes to believe that the most sensible way for this to be accomplished is not by making speeches in faraway lands but to give his countrymen something they can all cheer about. His solution is to galvanize the national rugby team, which to date had not been a particularly successful club and had been given very little chance to compete on an international stage like the World Cup. Mandela pins all of his political hopes on the club’s chances; should they fail, he will appear to have behaved frivolously in paying so much attention to a sport, and the black people and the white people would be even farther apart.<br/><br/>The odds were decidedly against the Springboks of South Africa. The team was a certified failure, so much so that the coach had just been axed. Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) is frustrated. Times are so bad in South Africa that during the team’s matches, the white audience members cheer for South Africa – but the black audience members cheer for the opposition, because the team itself is almost entirely white, with only one black player. Indeed, after Mandela’s election as president, South African groups vote overwhelmingly to drop the traditional rugby nickname “Springboks” as a way to shed themselves of all reminders of the apartheid era. Mandela realizes that such a action would instead drive a further wedge between the two races, so he countermands the local votes and maintains the nickname and the traditional green-and-gold uniforms.<br/><br/>Sports movies in general are expected to follow a particular formula, more so than other films. That is, if we’re met with a ragtag band of sandlot players, we expect them to somehow persevere by the end of the movie. This is one of the few genres in which such predictability is a major plus. Sports movies are meant to manipulate you shamelessly, and you’re a willing, permissive participant. Invictus certainly plucks all the heartstrings it can, but the bonus is that these events actually happened. This isn’t The Mighty Ducks beating the bad guys or Henry Rowengartner’s Cubs winning the World Series, this is a real-life rugby team gaining strength, wisdom, and inspiration from their newly elected president to triumph over steep odds.<br/><br/>That said, this is less a movie about winning the championship and more about unification. Mandela, who had been imprisoned for 27 years, had steep odds of his own to contend with. Although democratically elected, there were still plenty of people throughout the country who really didn’t trust their new leader at all and were convinced that he would lead them all to ruin. (Sounds a little familiar, and I assume that the timing was intentional on the part of Eastwood.) Mandela had to unite everyone, beginning with his own staff, in order for the country to move forward and have a seat at the proverbial international table.<br/><br/>Because of this grand vision, Mandela takes a personal interest in the fortunes of the rugby team, even to the point of rescheduling events so that he can watch the matches either in person or at least on television. He is careful not to intrude too much in the training and management of the team (particularly Pienaar).<br/><br/>Now, granted, this is an American movie made for American audiences, so there are some concessions. For one thing, the rules of rugby have to be mentioned at least once (and not enough, as far as I was concerned); for another, the focus isn’t just on the political machinations and aspirations of Mandela but rather on how the team itself reacts to its new success and the attempts by its captain to inspire them to ever-greater heights. What this slight sleight of hand does is present the idea of postpartheid attitudes in the framework of an athletic event, something American audiences can always care about, no matter the sport. Excellent decision by the director, I think, because the overall message is enhanced, rather than obscured, by the experiences of the Springboks.<br/><br/>Even with the political subtext, and even among sports movies (which themselves are usually very evocative), this is a highly emotional film. The rugby scenes are so well done, so fantastic to watch, that nonfans like me – who don’t know a thing about rugby – can’t help but let down their steely resolve and cynicism. This is a happy, optimistic movie, but it’s not a funny movie. There was hardly a dry eye in the theater today, thanks to the powerful rugby scenes, and I have to admit I haven’t teared up that much at any movie in a long, long time. Eastwood’s strong direction pushes the audience into the right direction, but we go willingly and happily. Freeman is commanding in the role he was always meant to play (Mandela himself wanted Freeman to portray him), and even Damon is excellent as the South African rugby captain. This is a true winner in all aspects of film."
"nicms99","10","33","41","1 May 2010"," This is the greatest inspirational movie
","I must confess that I am a great fan of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman an Matt Damon (not necessarily in this order), but what impressed me most in this movie was the story (and if it was real, much better!). We can learn from this story that not revenge, but forgiveness is the most powerful weapon of our beings. Seeing this picture movie I realized how difficult was for Mandela to prevent a civil war or even a riot on such a drastic change of regimes. For those who lived under hard circumstances (like apartheid, communism or so called socialism) is much easier to understand the subtlety of the story, and more than that, this movie is a must see. That's one of the reasons I rate it 10 out of 10."
"Matt_Layden","6","108","175","17 December 2009"," Well Made, But Completely Forgettable
","Nelson Mandela has been released from prison and was voted as the South African president. Wanting to unite his country, he found a way to do so with rugby and in the South African team captain, Francois Pienaar.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was born to play this role, he knew so, and that's why he produced this film. A dream project of his, waiting for someone to take the job of directing, his old friend Clint Eastwood steps in. Who says no to Clint? Especially Freeman, who under Eastwood's direction won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Invictus, William Ernest Henley, which is read by Mandela in the film, is well crafted and has a strong lead role. Unfortunately, the film is a by the numbers product that you seem to forget once you leave the theatre.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is the lack of emotion. I couldn't care for any of the characters in this film, save for Freeman, who as I stated does an excellent job. Matt Damon, who is shown on the poster, has the supporting role here. But he is given absolutely nothing to do except play rugby. His character has no story to him, but aren't we suppose to believe in him? After all, Mandela does. He gives him inspiration to win the world cup. Matt Damon does an alright job, but nothing worth mentioning. The same goes for the rest of the cast, they seem to be there just because the story is based on real life. <br/><br/>Eastwood knows how to direct a film, the Academy seems to think so too, so you know going into it that it well be well crafted. This is Eastwood's first step into a semi sports movie genre. The sport is rugby, and after watching the film, I still have no idea how to play it. The final act of the game is in slow motion as well, clichéd? You know it. You can hear every grunt from every player. It is elongated to the point of annoyance. The rugby sequences did not pull me in, nor did I care for who was going to win. It doesn't feel like he is trying to step out of his comfort zone either. It feels like an Eastwood movie, take that as you want. <br/><br/>The best parts of the film, are when Freeman commands the screen. His presence is more interesting and entertaining than any of the rugby scenes. Speaking of a rugby scenes, I must say that every 'epic' shot of the fans in the stands looked horribly fake. At some points I thought I was watching a PS3 game. It really took me out of the experience of the film. <br/><br/>If the film were a bit shorter and more focused (is it a sports film or character driven film?) than I could maybe invest my interest. It seemed to balance both as nice as it could, but ultimately gave out to one more than the other and unfortunately it's the weaker part. Eastwood chooses to sidestep more important things in the film. Is this because of the script? Are we suppose to want to keep watching Mandela inspire a rugby team to unite nation? The racial undertones are there at the beginning, then completely forgotten. In the end, I wanted more from this film.<br/><br/>The film is not bad, it's moderately good. Some scenes are actually inspiring, but that's more because of Freeman and not the generic script. I guess I wanted a little bit more from this one. Everyone involved made it seem like it should have been a great success, instead it comes off as something that everyone just decided to throw together. This is another film that belongs in that category of good, but not good enough for me to want to recommend it to you for theatre viewing."
"janyeap","10","22","33","8 December 2009"," A marvelous film to flash us back to South Africa's most precious historical moments...
","Indeed, a lovely and feel good movie that reminds us how a nation so stricken by apartheid and rebellions, and 14,000 civilians dead, is able to heal, and its turning point in history in reconciliation and strife for democracy. Director Clint Eastwood's film does pay tribute to both Nelson Mandela and the captain of the previously hated Springboks rugby team, Francois Pienaar for the Springboks's epic win against New Zealand's All Blacks with the final 15-12 score at the 1995 World Rugby Cup, as well as for their initiating the first major step towards white and black South Africans living together in acceptance. And that famous hand shake we see in the film really does speak a lot. <br/><br/>The match between the two teams at Johannesburg's Ellis Park Stadium in 1995 is so phenomenally presented on screen. Boy, it does look so real that I can't help myself cheering for the Springboks as if it's a life event! Eastwood, too, brings humor in the film. Boy, that famous moment with the All Black's gigantic superstar being tackled near the try-line by the big size Springboks defender! And the black and white Presidential guards gradually building up their trust in one another! These are so captivatingly funny. And with minutes ticking and Stransky does his amazing kick, sending the ball almost 100 ft to strike the drop goal to deliver the final score for Springboks' victory is so stunningly awesome! Fabulous film direction from Director Eastwood! The scenes with Matt Damon's visit to the prison are extraordinarily chilling, and fabulously crafted... reminding the viewers of the 27 yeas of prison and hard labor Mandela had to go through in his fight for his people's freedom against the NP's apartheid programs. Director Eastwood's film offers incredible spot on with facts, to include the Springboks' green and gold jerseys with their Springbok and Protea emblems! And, after the Springboks made their epic win over the All Blacks, watching Morgan Freeman's Mandela presenting the trophy to Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar while wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back, it's impossible not to be touched by that scene. Indeed, the many, who had watched that particular match in 1995 Rugby World Cup, can relate to that scene as seen live on TV worldwide. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman does play Mandela to a tee, Mandela's frailty, his gait, his charm and the way Mandela talks and smiles! And Damon is also no lesser credible as an Afrikaner rugby captain! Anyone familiar with Francois Pienaar would be able see Damon and Pienaar's physical builds are pretty similar. Boy, oh boy, do I love his Afrikaner accent! Indeed, my best feature film seen so far for the Oscar race. A true work of artistic film-making value that superbly unfolds South Africa's major historical events and moments! To observe the faces of hope on screen is so heartwarming. I certainly hope that this film and both Freeman and Damon would be getting Oscar nominations. <br/><br/>I really can't wait to get all my family members and friends to see this film! Best feature film I've so far seen for the Oscar race!"
"tucsonkent","10","13","18","22 December 2009"," A superb movie about the power of personal character to influence a nation
","Don't miss this inspiring movie! The acting is superb. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon become their characters. The attitudes of Damon's family help to exemplify the resistance to change. The attitudes of the South African blacks toward the mostly white South African rugby team reflects the deeply held anger of people who have suffered repression for generations.<br/><br/>The movie is a testament to the power of courageous personal character, when it is grounded in respectfulness and pragmatism, to inspire others to change attitudes that are deeply held.<br/><br/>The use of rugby as a tool to effect change is most appropriate. Clearly, everyone in the country cares deeply about the sport. The sport itself is quite brutal. Clint Eastwood does a superb job of conveying this element of the sport, as well as the importance of attitude in influencing a team's performance."
"DICK STEEL","10","12","18","2 January 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Invictus
","In his last 2 films, Clint Eastwood addressed the challenges one person faced against a corrupt, established system in the Changeling, and in Gran Torino, took on racism head on with himself starring in the lead role. With Invictus, I felt that it combined his last two films into one, with another veteran actor Morgan Freeman stepping into an historical role as Nelson Mandela, at a time just after being elected and faced with a deeply divided society across racial lines. This is not your usual run-of-the-mill biopic, and you can trust the award winning filmmaker to weave yet another wonderful, engaging film.<br/><br/>Set in a time just after Nelson Mandela was released from prison, and elected President of a post-apartheid South Africa still fresh from its racial, divisive wounds, the story based upon John Carlin's book Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Changed a Nation, traces the parallels in the challenges that Mandela had in governing a new country whose citizens still harbour deep, resentful mistrust against those of a different skin colour, with that against South Africa's national rugby team, known as the Springboks, in their uphill quest for World Cup glory, having initially been written off as no-hopers in the tournament. <br/><br/>We all know how sports can bring people of all races, class and all strata of society together, galvanized behind a winning team and celebrating victories as a nation. In fact, we've seen it for ourselves in our early days of nationhood, with Kallang being the battleground in which folks come together to cheer our football team on, regardless of race, language and religion. The same can be said here, where Mandela, with so much on his plate, chose to put some focus on the Springboks in their World Cup journey, knowing that his plan, trivial though crazy as it may seem at first, had all the foresight in knowing that reconciliation as a nation is within reach. All that's needed is for team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to believe he and his team can deliver.<br/><br/>Part of what contributed to this masterpiece is that the lead actors Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon both disappear into their roles. I've said enough thus far that Morgan Freeman remains one of my favourite character actors, though his role as this historical political figure, takes the cake. He took great pains to study the mannerisms of the man he's portraying and the result is magnificent, with what I've garnered from news reels on even his speech patterns gotten right down to a pat. As a man who walks the talk, we see this through the appointment of his security detail, as well as how he engages his back office team to look beyond skin colour, and to focus on ability instead, to do their jobs to the best of their abilities. This cinematic Mandela is as great an orator as the current US President, though at times when Eastwood tries a little too hard to force the messages of peace and forgiveness through, the speeches, monologues or dialogues do seem a tad heavy handed.<br/><br/>Audiences would likely be more familiar with Matt Damon's action role as Jason Bourne, though he has proved his acting chops through the Ocean Eleven/Twelve/Thirteen series, and his weight gain to play The Informant! Here he converts those fats into muscle mass to play rugby player Pienaar, though he had to rely on camera tricks and angles to make him look a lot bigger than he actually is. With his hair dyed blonde and new found bulk, he does look believable as he is charismatic in trying to also walk what Mandela has talked to him about, with responsibilities on the pitch to galvanize a team into believing they've got a shot at the largest trophy of their sport.<br/><br/>For all the economical minimalist that Clint Eastwood is reputedly touted for in his films, when it comes to the crunch he too does demonstrate that he's up to the mark in delivering epics based on history, such as his WWII magnum opus seen from both warring perspectives. A remarkable thing here about the film is that there's not a single, actual archived footage that was used (as far as I can tell), save some static photos in the end credits. Everything got recreated, right down to the exhilarating rugby games against the English, West Samoans, French and the famed New Zealand All Blacks (Check out that Jonah Lomu lookalike, and that Haka!) and the way Rugby got shot here will leave a fine impression on you, if not turn you into a fan of the game in the shortest time possible.<br/><br/>But what was real, was a powerful scene which was set in the actual cell that Mandela was incarcerated for years, where if I were to be put inside that same cell, I'd probably go insane given its bareness, as well as not being able to gaze outside and smell fresh air, unless to perform hard labour. It's an emotional sequence and one that will allow you to appreciate just how magnanimous Mandela was when he got released, versus the very human trait of wanting to seek revenge for injustice done against oneself.<br/><br/>Language wise, it may be a little difficult to listen to the South African accented English at times, but don't let that turn you off. It's another World Cup this year, football's that is, which will be held in South Africa, but before that swings by in Summer, make time for Invictus, and you'll be rewarded with yet another fine film from a director whose craft ages like fine wine, with masterful performances and an engaging storyline. Highly recommended!"
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","8","11","7 March 2010"," That film takes you by what you have most private, your soul
","Clint Eastwood was probably the only filmmaker who could produce a film on Nelson Mandela that centered on a side event that became a major initiative in the history of South Africa and the world. He chose to center the film on the Springboks and their victory in the World Cup of 1995. That was a brilliant idea since it showed Mandela as a real transformer of human beings. It also brilliantly proves man does not make history. A certain thickness of imbecility was needed to pile up in the minds of some not to see that the enslaved majority of the South African population could not remain slaves for ever. Let my people go. The choice, if it is a choice and not the only logical sequel of the fifty preceding years that Mandela does was to center his own action on a sports event that could unify the people in a victory. And we can see how little it takes to attract the attention and the heart of the other, a cup of tea for instance served by the President to his guest François, like Jesus washing the feet of his disciples before the Last Supper, though forgiveness is not that easy, and yet easier for the victims of the bad treatment than for the people who inflicted that bad treatment. Those had to become aware of the hardship of that treatment to finally be conscious enough to forgive themselves and to forgive the victims. Clint Eastwood then adds some symbols to strike our eyes: the little black boy carried by the white cops on their shoulders after the victory. The green Springboks cap Mandela is wearing at the end, not as a provocation of the All Blacks, but as a symbol of his support to his team and as a symbol of the unity of the country around their team. This film is first of all emotional for us who have lived these dark years and harbored for a night or several some AWOL special force soldiers who were deserting apartheid. And how many pages of ANC press releases have we translated for the whole world to know about their fight. And yet we wonder at the end who is the main character of this story. Nelson Mandela or François Pienaar. This appears clearly in the remarks these two exchange when Mandela gives the cup to François. ""Thank you François for what you have done for South Africa."" ""No, Mister President thank you for what you have done for South Africa."" And the green Springboks cap Nelson Mandela wears all the time is not a provocation to the All Blacks, but the sign of his support to his team, and the symbol of the reunification of South Africa thanks to that sports event. Then the answer François makes to the journalist when this one asks him if he was encourage in his fight by the 63,000 people in the Stadium, is prophetic: ""We were not supported by 63,000 people but by the 43 million South Africans."" That makes us very humble in front of history that no one can stop, than some can only slow down, ,and some others encourage and help in its own direction. And we will forget Henry Kissinger's answer when he refused to support Nelson Mandela, the political prisoner that he accused of being a communist. One of these details in history that get lost in the pages of some encyclopedia and then is forgotten by humanity.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

","I recently celebrated a milestone birthday. As I reflected upon the day, I thought about the sheer number of unlikely things that have occurred in my lifetime.<br/><br/>Back when I was ten, the idea that Great Britain and the IRA would ever achieve a ceasefire was, at best, a dim prospect. Likewise, no one thought the USSR would ever dissolve or that the Berlin Wall would be dismantled and the idea that a black man would one day be elected President of the USA was given about as much a chance of happening as finding two identical snowflakes.<br/><br/>The thought that South Africa, a county where racism WAS the official government policy would ever end its evil apartheid ways was almost inconceivable. Adding to that, the fact that the citizens of South Africa elected themselves a black president was an almost unbelievable turn of events.<br/><br/>Then, in order to prevent his country from devolving into resentment and revenge, President Nelson Mandela (a believer in the power of forgiveness) established the Truth And Reconciliation Commission where people could admit to their past racist misdeeds and then be publicly forgiven.<br/><br/>This showed me that the people of South Africa, both black and white have achieved a level of grace and civility that we Americans can only dream about.<br/><br/>If you don't believe me, just listen to any Teabagger or wingnut religious conservative on contemporary talk radio. You won't hear more foolish hateful nonsense this side of a fascist dictator. However, what the real Nelson Mandela did to avoid the potential revenge and recriminations of the people is an inspiring story that truly gives me hope for mankind.<br/><br/>So how come Invictus proved to be one of the most annoying experiences I have spent in a movie theater in a long time? Was it because director Clint Eastwood has reduced Nelson Mandela to a supporting player in his own life and instead focused his film on a white rugby team?<br/><br/>Was it because he turned Nelson Mandela into a Yoda-like character sputtering out banal philosophy that would embarrass even the flightiest of New Age nit-wits, or even a serious New Age nit-wit like Deepak Chopra? I mean, what has happened to Clint Eastwood?<br/><br/>How can it be that after directing about 30+ feature films, Eastwood still has not developed any kind of camera sense. I find it hard to accept the sloppy choices of angles and coverage in Eastwood's films, especially since he usually works with very competent cinematographers and editors.<br/><br/>Every poignant plot point is telegraphed well in advance, so any chance of surprise or insight is muffed. Is this what his vast experience in the film industry has taught him?<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has spoken with admiration of some of the directors he has worked with in the past, like the Hollywood studio trained minimalist Don Siegel and the operatic Italian Sergio Leone, in fact, he's even dedicated films to those two masters. Why Clint Eastwood now desires to direct films like Ron Howard is a true mystery.<br/><br/>But there are a couple of things in Invictus that even the anemically talented Ron Howard would never have done. For instance, what's with all the musical montages that serve no purpose but to slow down an already leaden pace?<br/><br/>What's with the unforgivable instance of showing a massive jet liner buzzing the rugby stadium during the final game? Now, I know that the plane buzzing actually happened, but Eastwood uses this incident as a way to instantly tap into our post 9/11 awareness of planes flying into buildings for terroristic purposes to create a false moment of tension.<br/><br/>I mean, even the most xenophobic American who cares not one whit about what happens outside the borders of the continental United States would have at least heard about a jet liner crashing into a rugby stadium in South Africa during the World Cup game, which, by the way, is actually played for by teams from around the world, most unlike our own masturbatory baseball World Series where we even celebrate the lunacy of two teams from the same city competing with each other, as if this were something culturally significant.<br/><br/>I could have told Eastwood that he was on a fool's errand if he was specifically trying to make an inspirational movie. If an audience finds some kind of inspiration from your film, that's great, but they are the only ones who can do that. <br/><br/>If you try to impose that feeling on people, you will just end up sounding preachy and scolding and believe me, the only thing worse than false sincerity is false inspiration.<br/><br/>Invictus is a two hour plus scolding lesson full of inspirational haranguing that has the effect of pummeling you into brain dead, but laudatory submission. But, when the whole damn fool audience is cheering at the most cliché of sport movie banalities, it is easier to just flow with the crowd.<br/><br/>Although not explained clearly, the title Invictus is Latin for ""unconquered"" and is the title of a famous poem by William Ernest Hensly that ends with the lines ""I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.""<br/><br/>Apparently, Nelson Mandela used to recite the poem to himself during his long imprisonment to help keep himself sane. But there is a more recent use of the poem Invictus that deserves to be mentioned.<br/><br/>It seems that when Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh was executed on June 11, 2001, he used the Hensley poem Invictus as his final statement. Why do I find that coincidence much more interesting and intriguing than this film? But hey, if it's inspiring enough for Timothy McVeigh, who am I to argue?"

"sioenroux","2","19","37","22 January 2010"," Clunky, chunky, cliché... I had to turn it off
","I didn't begin watching ""Invictus"" with any hopes of seeing something unique, edgy or original -- after all, a bare sketch of the plot tells you this is another of the ""Can-the-sports-team-make-it-against-the-odds? Oh-it-will-be-tough-but-in-the-end they'll-all-be-better-people-because-of-the-struggle"" genre.<br/><br/>I had hopes that with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, it might rise above the cliché formula. No, it didn't. They are both OK, but not nearly OK enough to save this clunker.<br/><br/>The level of Hollywood formula is off the charts. Every camera angle, every scene, you can predict with startling accuracy. That doesn't necessarily have to doom a movie (although for me, it pretty much does, because I hate nothing so much as predictability, especially scene by scene), but here it's just so pat you wonder if Clint Eastwood was sleeping through the whole thing.<br/><br/>What really sunk this film for me, though -- I mean, I rarely ever turn off a movie, and I could only handle this one for 20 minutes, after which I used FF and skimmed a few scenes along the way to see it through to the 'exciting' conclusion -- was the incredibly awful dialogue. Awful. Stilted. Ham-fisted. Sounded like a bad Hallmark afterschool special writer had come up with it. Really really bad.<br/><br/>I like Morgan Freeman a lot. In fact, in the past, I had jokingly said to friends that I could listen to him read the telephone book because I like the way he delivers lines. I am reconsidering that joke. ""We must (pause) work together (pause) if we are (pause) going to (pause) rebuild our country."" Repeat that line about 80 times in the first 15 minutes. With the same awkward pauses. Maybe this was Freeman capturing Mandela really well -- I don't know. What I do know is it was awful to try to watch.<br/><br/>In any case, let me submit for your consideration that you save your time. If you read the plot synopsis and look at the poster, you'll already have as full an experience as this movie is capable of delivering."
"DonFishies","6","20","41","17 December 2009"," Great work from Freeman and the story, but everything else feels average or amateur at best
","While not exactly a biopic per se, Invictus does tell an important piece of Nelson Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) life as President of South Africa. With the country's rugby team losing horribly match after match, he looks to Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to help unite the team in time for the country's hosting duties of the 1995 World Cup, and in turn, unite a country still reeling from apartheid.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood continues to defy all Hollywood conventions with Invictus, his ninth film of the decade. The man is going on 80, but he is pumping out more movies than heavyweights like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. And with each passing film, he continues to up his craft and his scope for what he is capturing on screen. While Invictus is nowhere near the epic undertaking of the twofer of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, it still stands as a very accomplished work. But much like Flags, it is a very flawed work.<br/><br/>The story itself is fairly well done. It is predictable of course, but is sappy in some wrong places. It is not quite Remember the Titans for adults like I heard it described as, but it borders on feeling much the same way. I find it interesting that the first real story we get about Mandela dramatized on screen is more about rugby than it is about the man, but Eastwood presents it in such a fascinating way that it manages to work as a depiction of him. There is a great reverence on display from the beginning, with actual TV footage digitally manipulated to add in Freeman over the real Mandela, and at every turn, the story stays consistent with these early images. It jumps around in focus between Mandela and Pienaar, but it never feels bothersome and always feels like a well rounded tale. Unfortunately, that tale does not always stay as interesting as it could.<br/><br/>But while the story is not bad, the editing is all over the place. After really beginning to hit his stride, Eastwood seems to be falling back and looking more amateur in some of the scenes on display here. Some run too long, others too short. Others are left far too open ended, and some too preachy. Even worse, some scenes have characters fading in and out like ghosts, pushing a heavy handed message about the unfairness of the system too far. Having seen his previous work, it is clear Eastwood knows better than this, so why allow these elements to take away from what could be a fantastic piece of work? <br/><br/>The ending rugby match that seems to run on forever has a lengthy period of time where everything runs in slow motion. While this is typical for a sports film, especially for the team playing, Eastwood makes everything run in slow motion: the team, the fans watching in the stadium, the fans at home and at bars, Mandela himself. And it runs for more than five minutes like this, overkilling and destroying any suspense or tension the film has going for it because the audience begins to laugh at how ridiculous the scene looks. It reminded me a lot of what I can only explain as the 'Gatorade' sequence from Spielberg's Munich, where one of the most intense scenes in the film is ruined by a goofy slow motion sequence. It takes you right out of the movie; the last thing any filmmaker wants to see happen.<br/><br/>The music fares even worse. While the African inspired songs that play throughout the film are very well used in their sequences, there are a few English-speaking songs that are just wrong for the film. Thankfully Eastwood does not sing any himself (unlike the hilariously bad tune that nearly ruins Gran Torino), but the lyrics are just awful. Again, they took me right out of the film, and made me laugh more than anything. They may help describe what is going on, but in the forms they are given to us, they do nothing but take away from everything. While I was a little disappointed to hear another similar Eastwood score in other cases, the addition of an African influence causes the score to sound all the better and more original. The man can only use a similar score for so many films before it becomes stale, and thankfully it is altered to sound all the more unique.<br/><br/>While his accent is not perfect, Freeman delivers another fabulous performance. The man may be ageing as quickly as Eastwood, but his technique never wavers. His soft spoken and generous nature is only complimented by how easily he slips into the character. He has just the right amount of power and gravitas in each scene that it is hard to realize it is not actually Mandela playing himself on screen. It is a very personal performance that is just as inspiring as it looks. It is not the performance of the year, but it comes really close to competing with it.<br/><br/>Damon on the other hand, does not fare so well. He just does not come off as believable as the rugby team's Captain. His accent falls somewhere between Freeman's great accent here and Nicole Kidman's horrible attempt at Italian in Nine. But even despite that, his character is just not compelling enough to make us really care about his struggle to help Mandela achieve his goals. When he does make it work, he does well for himself. But those moments come too few and far between.<br/><br/>I wanted to like Invictus more than I did. Freeman delivers, and the story is fairly well done as well. But the rest just feels either average or amateur at best. The film is not bad, but it could have been significantly better edited.<br/><br/>6.5/10."

","""Invictus"" is the Disney version of apartheid -- shallow, simplistic, and very disappointing. There is little suspense, and worse, next to no acknowledgment of South Africa's heroic efforts to face down its past. It's all rugby and Mandela all the time. The screenplay, with its ""Attaboy"" dialogue, reads like a 1940s baseball movie. Morgan Freeman's Mandela is stirring but Matt Damon's character is a cipher. And everyone else is just a face in the crowd, including the beautiful country of South Africa.

Just a waste of over 2hours. If one is going to tell a story, tell it like you mean it. This is a movie about sports, not life!

"Barky44","5","11","22","3 January 2010"," Sadly disappointing
","I'm very sorry to say it, especially because this film was created by talented folks such as Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood, but ""Invictus"" is terribly disappointing.<br/><br/>Nelson Mandela is a tremendously important figure in 20th Century history. His inspiring story affects not just South Africans but all of us. He deserves a film of the same emotional caliber as ""Ghandi"" was for Mahatma and ""Kundun"" was for the Dalai Lama. But ""Invictus"" falls flat and fails to live up to that standard. This is an incredible shame, too, for if IMDb Trivia is to be believed, Mandela himself believed that the world cup rugby story sums up his history, charisma, and leadership quite nicely and would make for a good film.<br/><br/>There are multiple problems with this film. First and foremost is the pacing. This movie is so dull, so lifeless, it clumsily plods along from one meeting to another with barely an emotional center at all. The script and the direction are the culprits here: too much idle chit chat. The biggest problem is the focus on the security detail. Fully 1/3 of the film is devoted to these chaps for no reason! There's little payoff for all that time investment. They should have been relegated to the sidelines, providing their one redeeming quality in this film: much-needed comic relief.<br/><br/>Next is Matt Damon. Now I am far from a Matt Damon basher, I think he's a fine actor and never find him to be an ego distraction like so many other stars. But he adds very little to this story, his character could also have been sidelined. It seems like the producers wanted star power to get this project off the ground so they fished around for a big-name white star to give the film some cred and hopefully an audience. <br/><br/>Then there's rugby itself. This has to be one of the worst sports movies ever made in terms of not engendering interest in the sport itself. I think ""MIghty Ducks"" did more to promote hockey than ""Invictus"" did to promote rugby. A sports movie should engage and excite the viewer. This one simply showed the stereotype that rugby is a brutal, pointless sport. I doubt there will be many kids lining up to learn rugby as a result of this film.<br/><br/>Most aggravating is something the film LACKS. One of the most inspiring things to ever come out of Africa is the music. Where are the great African rhythms? This soundtrack, and the use of music throughout the film, is terrible. There's even this full-blown American pop number in the middle of it. None of the great, traditional, powerful, inspirational African music is in this film at all, and that really bothers me.<br/><br/>This is a crying shame. Nelson Mandela's story needs to be told. ""Invictus"" fails to tell it well."

","Normally I am a bit skeptical when it comes to sport movies but when I heard that this one was being made I hoped to myself that Clint Eastwood does it justice as many of us South Africans that were alive at that time (and also like myself went to see the final match at Ellis Park) still have very fond memories of it. This film does not fail. It doesn't even come close to failing. But what the film did show is that sport and politics can be used to bring people together. And yes Morgan Freeman, in my opinion, did not fail as Nelson Mandela. Matt Damon was good (his South African accent is probably as good any American can do it, and the best that I have heard in any American financed movie) as Captain Francois Pienaar but the real scene stealer is Freeman. The rugby being played in the film was real. The 'plays' in the film were real. Everything about the film was about as close to the event as it can be. Don't watch it on a small screen, it literally begs to be watched on a HUGE SCREEN!!!"
"seka-gaula","Null","3","4","27 October 2011"," Typical in your face movie
","The movie looks very impressive but only to foreign people, who are clueless about South Africa's political history. The same could be said of its director, Clint Eastwood, who seems to have just read a book about Mandela & his commitment to help South Africa win the World Cup Rugby and did a movie about it, without any profound knowledge about South Africa's political heritage.<br/><br/>Eastwood makes it look as if Mandela had it all his way after becoming the president of South Africa,and we South Africans know there's no truth to this. There's no F.W.De Klerk in this movie & some white Afrikaaners who still endeavoured to make things difficult for Mandela & the entire black race in a post apartheid South Africa, meaning those who thought that blacks were going to oppress whites in the same way that whites maltreated blacks. There's more humour in the movie & less the emotional trauma that engulfed the black race during this period.<br/><br/>Towards the movie's end, there's a white guy lifting up a black kid in rejoice after South Africa trounced New Zealand to win the World Cup. That to me was so unrealistic it was like a fantasy dream.<br/><br/>And what about the flaws in this movie, which IMDb movie reviewers declined to mention? Morgan Freeman struggling to pronounce Mandela's middle name, ""Rholihlahla"", when Mandela took oath for the first time as president of South Africa? That was a total disgrace because Mandela had always taken pride in pronouncing African names correctly. If Eastwood was smart, he would've hired someone to pronounce Mandela's middle name & pretended as if it was Freeman doing so.I hear from a reliable source that they did the same with Terrence Howard, who will also try his luck as Mandela in the upcoming movie, Winnie, alongside Jennifer Hudson, who will portray Winnie Mandela. Adjoah Andoh's accent was also very annoying & I can assure you there's no South African who speaks like that.<br/><br/>And Freeman keeping quiet in singing the national anthem during the final match between South Africa and New Zealand? Aah common! Mandela always sang our national anthem to the full to encourage other people to be patriotic about our country.<br/><br/>To encapsulate, I think it's for the better that South Africans portray their own political heroes because they know their political history better than anybody else. They also won't struggle to emulate the African accents of their political heroes since they are naturalised in them.<br/><br/>And the movie is very predictable, looks like a sports like Disney movie & doesn't leave any memories behind. If I had to give anyone credit in this movie, it would be Tony Kgoroge, who portrayed Mandela's bodyguard, Jason Tshabalala. Watch the movie & you could really see him trying his best to invoke those much needed emotions in the movie. And what did Matt Damon do to be nominated for an Oscar award in this movie? I give the movie 6/10 & it's even lucky to get that from me.<br/><br/>Seka Samuel Gaula Cape Town, South Africa"

","To my mind, this is less about South Africa, sport and Mandela than about another man.<br/><br/>Oh, the drama was really there. It doesn't matter that it was not as significant in uniting a nation as depicted. How could it be? How could it?<br/><br/>But the dramatic form is there because it works. We like to show the sweep of the large by embossing on an individual. Here at least we don't have love. And we like to illustrate a personal struggle by showing masses in huge movement. Masses and mass excitement are cinematic, and human internals cannot be. So we show internal struggle by external means.<br/><br/>What I celebrate is another man, Clint Eastwood. Now here is a man well past the time he could relax, making significant films. This is not complex like ""Mystic River,"" nor as cheaply mawkish as ""Million Dollar Baby."" It is in between. But it is — if I recall — the first time Clint has shown mass movement. Here he uses Morgan Freeman in ways that Morgan has a hard time cheapening the thing. <br/><br/>Photographing moving team sports like football, soccer and basketball is something of a challenge. You have to make decisions about what role the camera plays. Dance is a similar challenge, but you have more flexibility because the tradition in theater is to break the walls and engage. In sport, the barrier between player and watcher is sacrosanct. The drama depends on you investing in the game; the fiction that the players represent you is tangible.<br/><br/>But it equally depends on you being remote, whether in a stadium or in an upholstered chair in your home. That distance makes the business work. It allows representation without inclusion, because the viewer gets the pleasure of having someone else do his work for him. It has to be explicit that it is someone else.<br/><br/>So the camera cannot take the viewer into the game as a participant. It has to always be a watcher. But how to do so, staying within the carefully evolved confines of watcherdom and still give us some greater immediacy? Eastwood finds a balance. He relies a bit too much on the camera on the ground, looking into the locked players for me. But he strikes a better balance than say Oliver Stone does in ""Any Given Sunday,"" which is basically a war movie without death.<br/><br/>Eastwood. Building a legacy, one small but well crafted film at a time.

"Wibola","9","4","6","16 October 2010"," An event that helped shape a nation
","From a close intimate encounter with one of the greatest leaders of our time, to a big joyful sports event that helped shape a nation, Invictus will take you on a journey of discovery of the crucial elements that inspire us in life. In the early 1990's the world went through major political changes that were coming in the wake of the walls falling in Berlin in August 1989. In 1990 Nelson Mandela was released after 27 years in prison. In 1994 he was elected the President of South Africa. Invictus takes us back to 1995, just one year after Mandela was elected president, in a time when he struggled to gain the confidence of the white population and had to live up to the expectations of the blacks. South Africa is the host country for the upcoming Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela cease the opportunity to make this event, and the nations Rugby team ""the Springboks"", a catalyst for uniting the nation. Clint Eastwood brings us into the world of Mandela and show us a man that is torn between the love of his country and the love of his family. Eastwood manages to create a good balance of personal reflections and the public difficulties that Mandela faced at this time. The overall atmosphere of the movie is quite uplifting in contrast to what is characteristic about Eastwood's movies such as the gloomy setting in Mystic River or the melancholic sports drama in Million Dollar Baby. Mandela is played by Morgan Freeman who has studied Mandela in great detail and spend much time with him in real life. His work sure paid off as he comes off the screen as the real soft spoken and yet authoritative leader we all know so well. The other important character in the movie is the Springboks captain Francois Pienaar. Pienaar is played by Matt Damon that does a good job of showing the white man's perspective and help us realize the questions that runs through his mind in his search for understanding the changes his the country is going through with Mandela as the new leader.<br/><br/>The real life story that Invictus is based upon, recorded by the journalist John Carlin's in his book ""Playing the enemy"", makes this one of the best biography movie I have seen this year. It does not try to explain all of Mandela's life but give us a glimpse into a crucial moment in his life and help us understand the qualities that made him a great leader and what ultimately made him the man elected by blacks and whites to unite South Africa."

","The film made up of one half showing the problems Mandela faced during his presidency and how he tried to unite the county after apartheid and one half showing the actual rugby games.<br/><br/>The scenes with Mandela (Freeman) were very well directed and the portrayal of Mandela was close to flawless (as expected from Morgan Freeman). However the focus was on the rugby and it seemed Mandela spent more time watching the games and talking to the players than doing anything else. You are left with a strong feeling of not having enough insight into Mandela's presidency.<br/><br/>This isn't helped by the rugby scenes being filmed akin to a live televised sporting event. You see the same angles ad nauseam and the camera is generally so wide you have no idea what is happening. The director also seems to refuse to use a shallow depth of field at any point - you have no idea what you should be focusing on even on close up angles.<br/><br/>It can be argued all this is intentional as you're not supposed to focus on the game, but should rather focus on the crowd and see just how much impact the game had in uniting the country. However this premise was hugely overplayed in my opinion and the movie makes it look like rugby single-handedly ended racism in South Africa.<br/><br/>With over an hour of rugby footage, it's hard to justify just how poorly the action was filmed and with an overplayed premise, even Morgan Freeman's fantastic acting can't save this one - 2/10."
"Turfseer","5","7","13","24 December 2009"," 'Feel-good' race relations flick or extended rugby highlight reel? Take your pick!
","'Invictus' is designed to be a 'feel-good' movie about relationships between blacks and whites. The setting is South Africa beginning with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990 and his subsequent ascent to the South African presidency a short time later. Morgan Freeman does a great job in 'channeling' the great man and you really feel as if you're watching Mandela himself. When the Oscars come up, Freeman has a very good shot at copping the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's strategy is to depict Nelson Mandela's program for racial reconciliation through the narrow prism of International Rugby. While there are a few interesting glimpses of Mandela interacting with his main assistant and some of his counselors, little of his personal life is shown (there is a brief scene where he's depicted as being alienated from his daughter who regards him as something of a sell-out). By the second half, Mandela is reduced to being basically a cheerleader for the South African Rugby team. Still, the sheer humanity of Mandela is always at the forefront, with his emphasis on forgiveness.<br/><br/>I liked the first half of Invictus better than the second. There's a good scene where Mandela tries to persuade a group of his constituents (a Sports Federation) not to disenfranchise the rugby team. Mandela, in Christ-like fashion, urges the crowd to 'turn the other cheek' and support the team despite their identification of the white players with the apartheid era. Despite their initial rejection, blacks in South Africa gradually come to root for the team. One way they're won over is after Mandela asks the team to tour the shanty towns and introduce rugby to poor black children. It helps that there's one black player on the team who becomes a national figure. But when Mandela visits the team before a big game and congratulates each player individually, he's sending a signal that he's for whites as much as blacks. And the white players (who are initially depicted as being quite alienated and angry after Mandela becomes President) gradually soften up too: in one poignant scene, they go on a tour of the prison where Mandela was held for 27 years. Later they're not afraid to sing the new South African anthem with their black countrymen.<br/><br/>Less successful are the scenes involving Mandela's bodyguards. The tension between the black and white bodyguards at the beginning is quite understandable. But virtually none of the characters are ever fleshed out. It takes a team victory in the Rugby World Cup to get them all hugging one another. But the camaraderie seems quite superficial. One wonders if everyone will be so touchy-feeley once all the excitement has worn off.<br/><br/>Invictus completely loses steam in the second half. There's virtually no suspense since the film's outcome is a forgone conclusion. What's worse is that the idea of an antagonist is lost as the film plods along. The tension between blacks and whites is palpable at the beginning but as the focus shifts to the rugby team itself, where is the conflict? Good movies have a moment where the protagonist faces a moment of crisis leading to a 'dark moment of the soul'. The best Invictus offers us is when Mandela collapses after being overworked. It's not enough! <br/><br/>The awkwardness of the entire screenplay is embodied in the relationship between the team captain, Francois Pienaar, played by Matt Damon, and Mandela. They have one scene together when Mandela invites Pienaar to tea. We find out next to nothing about Pinaar but maybe that's because there's not a lot to find out. Damon runs around a lot on the field but only briefly confronts his teammates who are initially reluctant to embrace Mandela's plan for reconciliation. Again, where is the conflict? <br/><br/>As an American who is unfamiliar with the rules of rugby, I was bored watching scene after scene of grown men groping one another without protective equipment. Since Eastwood really had no exciting climax to offer, he pads the last twenty minutes of the film with what I would term an extended 'highlight reel'. For rugby aficionados, this might prove to be orgasmic. As for ignorant Americans such as myself, I never thought I'd be desperate to tune into next Sunday's football game so quickly.<br/><br/>Some have claimed that Invictus is just another film about race relations from the white man's perspective. Maybe so but I prefer to view it as primarily a mediocre sports film. On the plus side, if one wishes to feel good without thinking too hard, then one can indulge oneself in this rather superficial glimpse of racial harmony. While Invictus fails in the drama department, Morgan Freeman's performance as the great and inspiring Mandela will make you look at race relations from the glass being half full and not half empty."

","On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released after twenty-seven years imprisoned in Robben Island. In 1994, he is elected President of South Africa and he tries to unite his nation that is divided by the apartheid. Near the Rugby World Cup 1995 in South Africa, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) invites the captain of the Springboks François Pienaar (Matt Damon) to come to the government palace for a tea and inspires François to win the championship with his team. <br/><br/>""Invictus"" is a pleasant movie about the integration of people through the sports, in a country racially and economically split, by an enlightened man that preaches reconciliation and forgiveness. Morgan Freeman, as usual, has a great performance in the role of the great South African leader. However, this film should be shorter and spends too much time in sequences of rugby, a sport that is not popular in my country and therefore boring and uninteresting to me. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Invictus"""

"burgernerd","3","8","16","28 December 2009"," Political sports movie. What did you expect?
","Sure Freeman was good, but whatever. I was hoping that ""Gran Torino"" was an aberration for Eastwood, but this is actually worse. Even for those who find inspiration in films like ""Rudy"" or ""Big League"" this may be a stretch. OK, the Springboks surprising win was a unifying event for SA, but why make a big budget movie out of it? For a sports film, the rugby scenes are shot well and the stadium crowd is believable. However, somehow there is little reward in rooting for the underdog. Rugby remains foreign to North America and to set a political drama around it, is not engaging. Considering the Hollywood heavyweights involved, the story of South African racial tensions of the last 40 years could have been addressed more poignantly than through a whimsical sports drama."
"Quinoa1984","6","9","19","12 December 2009"," The Master of His Fate is given a decent, corny sports movie
","In Invictus, Morgan Freeman doesn't have to act like Nelson Mandela, since he basically *is* Mandela (more God-like in demeanor and in his kindness and reserve than his God in the 'Almighty' franchise). His poise and speech and way of showing immense pain and conflict buried underneath a strong demeanor is perhaps reason enough to see this movie. Seeing him on screen, acting intensely even when sitting calmly in a car with his sunglasses on, is seeing a tremendous actor doing service to a marvel of a human being like Mandela. I just wish this Mandela, who is what he is and is alongside Matt Damon as a likable-tough South African Rugby captain, was in a movie less corny and more political. The story is the tale of the 95 Rugby World Cup, but it's also the story of Mandela in this context, and the balance between the two becomes, shall we say, 'sappy'.<br/><br/>With all due respect to Clint Eastwood, it comes off here like all Nelson Mandela did as president was worry about how South Africa was doing in whatever Rugby game was going on, even when doing President-things like meetings and speeches. It's meant to be a stirring sports movie - how the underdog triumphed against the odds - more-so than a politically-charged screed, which is fine, on paper. But I wish the sports scenes were less corny and we saw more of what Mandela did as President. His tactic is clear, to be sure: get the Rugby team to win the world cup, and unite the nation. This, too, is fine, on paper or in theory. But we only get very slight glimpses of this nation's strife, and people going into the film without knowing the history of the aftermath of apartheid will be getting a story that is half-cooked around the facts and pablum of victory.<br/><br/>It is watchable, don't get one wrong: the scenes where Mandela projects his influence on people is magnetic to see. Mandela in front of a crowd can be just as moving and interesting as in front of one person, be it that sports organization he comes to as a surprise visit (""You chose me as your leader - let me lead""), or his cool rationale for focusing so strongly on Rugby (""It's a ... human calculation""). One wishes for more of that in some part to Freeman's presence and control of the role, but also because the scenes with the Rugby team, frankly, aren't anywhere near as compelling. We've seen this story before and even without knowing the true story know it's outcome minutes before it's presented, like, as they say in sports movies, ""destiny"".<br/><br/>Again, some of the predictability would still be fine, and is tolerable, but Eastwood also doesn't really do enough to give the Rugby matches real uplift and energy. He does try in the climax, but in, again, a corny aspect - he cuts between the various fans watching in bars and houses and in the sold out arena New Zealand/South Africa are playing in, and then with a little boy who may/may not be getting ready to do something with an object in a bag, only to stop by the awesome power of the game on radio. Perhaps if one is a sucker for such inspiring stories, this will come as the treat of the season. For those wanting something more from its iconic filmmaker, or to see a side of President Mandela outside of being a hardcore Rugby enthusiast, it disappoints. But, at the least, it has that embodiment of a great figure at its center, the best one's seen since the days of Henry Fonda as Lincoln."
"Mark_Burton","9","5","9","11 January 2010"," Invictus: a story of forgiveness
","Invictus explains how Nelson Mandela used the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unite his country racially divided after years of apartheid. Clint Eastwood decided not to focus on Mandela's life but rather on his action as South Africa president. It's a story about forgiveness, greatness and the way to stop racism. <br/><br/>Nelson Mandela is perfectly played by Morgan Freeman who demonstrates one more time that he's a Hollywood living legend. Here, his ""greatness"" is partly linked to the marvellous lines which seemed written by Mandela himself: full of wisdom, full of love, translating his philosophy of life. Matt Damon makes a good job as Pienaar, despite some other comments I have read. I've particularly appreciated his work on accent. Second roles are also well-played with special mention to Tony Kgoroge (chief of black bodyguards) and Adjoah Andoh (Mandela's Chief of Staff). <br/><br/>The script remembers Million Dollar Baby as sport is only an excuse to focus on deeper subjects. I really loved the scene where the black bodyguards met for the first time their white colleagues to make a unified team, or the first meeting between Mandela and Pienaar, around a cup of tea, with Mandela explaining how to inspire and bring people to greatness.<br/><br/>I'm more and more convinced that Clint Eastwood is one of the best directors in Hollywood. This movie, as his previous ones, is simple but so inspiring. If you loved Million Dollar Baby or Changelling, you will love this one. To conclude, Invictus is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies with an incredible performance by Morgan Freeman and a deep philosophy of life which should inspire all of us.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"zardoz-13","9","5","9","14 December 2009"," Sentimental But Never Sappy Sports Saga
","Morgan Freeman has so much talent that he makes acting look easy. In director Clint Eastwood's latest movie ""Invictus,"" based on John Carlin's non-fiction book ""Playing the Enemy,"" Freeman impersonates controversial South African President Nelson Mandela. Interestingly, Mandela said that Freeman was the only actor who he felt could do him justice on the big-screen. Basically, this inspirational sports saga about rugby concerns more than just capturing the 1995 World Cup. ""Sherlock Holmes"" scenarist Anthony Peckham and Eastwood have produced a solemn, straightforward, but contemplative film about how Mandela shrewdly appropriated a hated symbol of apartheid and wielded it so that he could unite a racially torn nation. In other words, the savvy politician pulled the ultimate public relations ploy and used a rugby team. This factual social activist melodrama with its liberal perspective seems rather predictable at times, but it is remains nevertheless as reassuring as it is absorbing. Essentially, two minds meet in ""Invictus"" and forge a change that solidified a country. The performances by Morgan Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as a conscientious rugby coach are flawless. Damon appears physically fit for such a demanding role and his accent sounds reasonable. Some scenes seem almost too good to be true, particularly the camaraderie between a young black teen and two gruff-looking South African beat cops during the World Cup game. Unlike most sports films, ""Invictus"" dwells more on how the game of rugby engineered racial harmony in a repressive society than about the game itself.<br/><br/>After 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven"") emerges and wins the presidency of South Africa. Mandela's victory ushered in many striking changes, and his fellow blacks wanted to disband the South African team, the Springboks, because it reminded them of racial oppression. No sooner does Mandela hear about this rash decision than he races out to appeal to his constituents about the error of their ways. Of course, they hate the Springboks, but Mandela urges them to support him and his request to leave the Springboks alone. Mandela convinces them that this represents a splendid opportunity to allay white fears about black power. Initially, Mandela's closest adviser warns him about this kind of activism. Meanwhile, the Springboks are doing themselves no favors with their abysmal performance on the playing fields. A Mandela adviser observes that winning the World Cup would create a lot of ppsitive publicity for the new government and Mandela summons blond Afrikaner, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") who bears no political crosses, and encourage him to win the World Cup. The messiah-like Mandela exerts considerable influence on Pienaar and the coach takes his pampered team on promotional tours into the most squalid of black ghettos to teach the children the basics of the game. Early in ""Invictus,"" one of Mandela's white bodyguards describes to his black cohorts the essentials of rugby: ""Soccer is a gentleman's game played by hooligans, rugby is a hooligan's game played by gentlemen."" When Peckham and Eastwood aren't concentrating on Mandela's cagey political maneuvers, they depict the changes that occurred all over South Africa with a subplot about the president's integrated team of bodyguards. Mandela's chief of security had requested more bodyguards, so the president obliges him with British-trained, Afrikaner cops. Indeed, Mandela discourages any whites from leaving government service because he needs them as examples of unity within his administration. Time gradually erodes white anxieties about black aspirations as reflected by grudging cooperation between the black and white bodyguards. Again, rugby takes center stage with the whites explaining the rules of rugby to their colleagues.<br/><br/>Nelson Mandela comes off looking as slippery as James Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" Mandela doesn't miss a trick in his political calculations and he impresses his closest adviser. Indeed, Mandela emerges in ""Invictus"" as an Abraham Lincoln of sorts. He survived 24 years of brutal, back-breaking imprisonment on an island and slept on a mat for a bed. This same individual, who endured enormous hardship, later ascended from the lowest position in society—a prison inmate—and attained the highest post—president of the same country that had incarnated him. Mandela realized from his pinnacle of power that the only way to thwart an immanent civil war that threatened to tear South Africa apart that he had to exercise accommodation toward his fellow whites.<br/><br/>Wisely, director Clint Eastwood doesn't have much truck with politics in ""Invictus."" Peckham and he provide the basic ground work about the sudden changes that rocked South Africa with Mandela's election as president. They present us with the struggles that the Springbox with their green and gold outfits endure. Mandela demonstrates true insight into his fellow men when he decides to let a predominantly white rugby team become a rallying cry for intolerance and unity. No, ""Invictus"" is not the kind of movie that you would expect from Clint Eastwood and—like his protagonist who prefers to make risks—Eastwood has helmed and honed another classic. ""Invictus"" ranks as a sentimental sports saga that never gets sappy. Incidentally, ""Invictus"" translated means invincible."
"nsanehops","5","9","20","11 December 2009"," Eastwood Falters
","Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon give standout performances in what may be Clint Eastwood's least effective film to date.<br/><br/>Following the story of Nelson Mandela's early presidency (Morgan Freeman in a genuine portrayal despite some trouble with the accent), and the improbable journey of South Africa's rugby team to the 1995 World Cup final, Clint Eastwood pilots an obsessively sanitized depiction of true events that feels like a big-budget, G-rated movie of the week. Matt Damon—sporting a prosthetic, tough-guy nose—is solid as team captain Francois Pienaar (and much more consistent with the accent) and forges a believable kinship with Mandela. Pienaar inspires his squad to greatness at the beaconing of a wise president who understands the power of national pride in calming political unrest. <br/><br/>Racial hostility is alluded to but scarcely seen with the exception of a few impolite stares and uncomfortable parings between black and white side characters. The inexcusably slow pace is further aggravated by a surprising lack of suspense or obstacles that even maintain the facade of insurmountability. What could have been a riveting, though formulaic, exercise in underdog political and athletic achievement plays more like a tribute video to a country whose growth seems inevitable.<br/><br/>Narrative focus seems to be the main hang-up for Eastwood, as much screen time is dedicated to a sport that few can follow without prior exposure, and too little attention paid to the complexities of Mandela himself. Drama nearly builds as Mandela's security detail meticulously prepare for the worst before each public appearance, but no assassination attempts are thwarted because none take place.<br/><br/>Poor sound work and opaque editing (especially during the climax) round out what time will reveal as a low point for team Eastwood. Hearing the sound of jerseys ripping at the highest volume may have sounded artsy on the page, but it pulled me out of the moment. As did the continual cutting to aerial shots of the frantic CG stadium crowd anytime a play was completed on the field. We get it Clint; this is a big movie.<br/><br/>Thankfully the cast is talented enough to elevate an unfortunate Eastwood misfire into a thoroughly mediocre film."

","Since the movie tells a true story, no need for me to go into the  detail here, as all roads lead to a culminating World Cup event... in  Johannesburg and including the South African rugby team. It's fabulous  and uplifting, even a bit of a tearjerker. Eastwood is so good with  little directorial touches, such as when a tough security guy for the  De Klerk regimenow a welcome member of the Mandela security  staffslaps on his sunglasses to conceal moist eyes... or as the World  Cup final proceeds, a little black street boy, who would formerly be  chased away by white police, is seen sitting on the car of the police,  everyone intently listening to the car radio.  And musically, the film is one of the more interesting you'll have the  pleasure of hearing. As many realize, Clint Eastwood is quite an  accomplished composer himself, having written and in some cases  performed the scores for some of the movies he directs. I think with  Invictus, he's a kid in a candy store. The melodies and rhythms of the  native South African music are so rich and fluid, they roll out  naturally without blasting you into the balcony. Whoever did the  scoreno doubt Eastwood had a sayskillfully weaves sound with sight.  It's great... and I don't generally pay much attention to movie scores."
"leeandfong","9","4","7","24 December 2009"," A film about inspiration that genuinely inspires.
","In what is sure to be one of those films that is widely acclaimed but little seen, Clint Eastwood has crafted one of the most hopeful and inspirational films of recent times that rises head and shoulders above all around it on the strength of good writing, great performances, tight direction and above all, an honest to God brilliant story.<br/><br/>After 27 years in prison, the newly elected president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, has inherited a country where racism, bitterness and vengeful hatred could send the land into civil war. Armed with little more than his charm, wit, humility and intellect, he must somehow unify the deep divisions in society and knows he must do so by example; his quest, so to speak, is to discover the strategies that will inspire his countrymen to share in his dream of a rainbow nation.<br/><br/>When he sees the dreadful national rugby team get beaten, something that emotionally hurts the white South Africans whilst pleasing the blacks, he spots an opportunity to create an iconic focal point in which all South Africans can take pride. So he telephones the team captain, invites him for tea and recruits him into his thinking. All they need to do now is get the support of millions of blacks who hate rugby.<br/><br/>The movie could have fallen into familiar sporting drama territory, by showing the underdogs in a training montage, or having a crisis of confidence; but this isn't your usual sporting drama. This isn't Rocky, or The Mighty Ducks. Instead, Invictus is about Mandela providing as much inspiration and positive leadership to unify his country as possible. As we marvel at his humility in the face of adversity and his courage to make difficult choices we become invested in the story and start cheering. The rugby is just a sideshow, the real sporting hero is Mandela.<br/><br/>The heart of the film is to show that when you lead by example, that when you keep pushing hard to inspire goodness in others, when you encourage the bitter and the angry to allow themselves hope, then ultimately, with perseverance, you can move mountains. It is here, as you watch those mountains crumble to dust you become overwhelmed by the power of the story.<br/><br/>Mandela wanted to unify black and white through sport and Eastwood has crafted some joyous storytelling moments. In one beautiful vignette, a young black boy tries to listen to the big game on the radio of some white security guards. At first the guards shoo him away but he hovers close by, pretending to pick up trash. As the match progresses and the tension mounts, the boy gets closer and closer until eventually he and the guards are living the moment together. He ends up sitting on the car bonnet and sharing a coke with the security guards as they chew their fingernails with the stress of the match.<br/><br/>As for the rugby, there's a perfect balance between the sport and drama. Eastwood obviously knew that Rugby isn't played everywhere and very skillfully squeezes in as much as you need to know. But the scoring and rules don't matter; the stunning slow motion action with bone crushing sounds on the tackles are just eye-candy between the emotions.<br/><br/>Invictus is a modern day morality play that shows us what can be achieved by kindness, forgiveness, humility and diplomacy. It is made all the more poignant by being a true story. In fact, directly after seeing the movie I started watching the real event on youtube and I would strongly recommend anyone who has seen this movie to do so. When Matt Damon tells a sportscaster ""there aren't 60,000 people cheering for us, there are 43 million cheering for us."" its an immense moment fitting of a Hollywood movie, but to then watch on youtube, the real Francois Pienaar say it, you will be moved to tears.<br/><br/>Invictus is an inspired and inspirational heart warming movie that is truly refreshing to the soul and spirit. The writing, performances and direction are sublime and the overall experiences is truly uplifting. Expect it to do deservedly well come awards season."
"secondtake","7","3","5","14 November 2012"," A routine look at a legendary man at a critical time--it works by appreciating Mandela
","Invictus (2009)<br/><br/>It helps to have Nelson Mandela as your main character. The inspiration he provided his country for decades, in and out of jail, is transferred here through a single focus--the national rugby team. In the form of Morgan Freeman, Mandela is made to be as profound and humble as he truly seemed to be, at least as a public figure.<br/><br/>So even if you have troubles with Clint Eastwood movies (they all seem pretty decent, you have to admit, whatever the repeating clichés in them), this one rises above in enough parts to warrant the good attention. Eastwood, to be sure, never appears. This is mostly Freeman's movie, though the other big name is Matt Damon, who is good enough (as usual) in a role that is minor and fairly straight forward, the captain of the team.<br/><br/>The best of the movie is the interpersonal mixing with the political. We get a glimpse (if only that) of post-apartheid South Africa, and of how fractious the scene was. And how Mandela used the mostly white rugby team to represent a new, tolerant country with its new, tolerant black president. It's a clever, clear way to get into that world in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Where the movie gets most outwardly exciting it gets more ordinary--at the Rugby World Cup. Then it becomes a kind of sports movie where the underdog seems like it really might win. It helps to have the larger themes of reconciliation and Mandela's presence mean so much in it all, but eventually it's all about getting the goal. I was cheering for the S. African team but I was also losing respect for the movie's more interesting (and important) intentions. I know, that makes me seem mixed up, but you might see what I mean when you get there.<br/><br/>Does this sentimentalize the situation? Oversimplify? Make Hollywood and far more interesting and complicated and sometimes unhappy affair? Probably a loud yes on all accounts. But in that sense, it really is a Clint Eastwood film. Well made stuff, but not half what it might have been."

Clint Eastwood directs, as Matt Damon, perhaps for the first time in career, acts so well that you forget you're watching Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Damon portraits François Pienaar, the captain of the South African Rugby team; a team that is talented but in a wholesale state of disarray. The team's players are listless and unmotivated, while their level of play is evocative of the Bad News Bears. Meanwhile, the nation's black rugby fans cheer not for South Africa but for England.<br/><br/>At the same time, newly elected Nelson Mandela wrestles with the task of running the government and uniting the country while reconciling black aspirations with white fears.<br/><br/>With South Africa hosting the soon-approaching World Cup, the rugby team's management is fired while the new black government coalition tries to change the team's mascot and team name, The Springboks, in attempt to erase all memory of Apartheid.<br/><br/>Mandela quietly calls on captain Pienaar to reset the tone of the team and prepare the Springboks for the unlikely feat of winning the World Cup at home and uniting the nation.<br/><br/>Invictus gets its name from a poem by William Ernest Henley that Mandela holds dear as something that made him stand up when, imprisoned for 26 years, ""all he wanted to do was lie down"". Like the poem, which speaks of the ability to take responsibility for one's destiny, the film tells the story of South Africa's steps forward in the work-in-progress of setting free the nation, both psychologically and socio-politically from its checkered past.<br/><br/>Invictus has so many important facets at work in a brilliant, exciting, but well-tailored storyline, that you'll digest it for days.

","INVICTUS is a major disappointment from Clint Eastwood, and the film doesn't add much to his great achievements of his latter directional career. It's sadly tame, and doesn't seem very inspired, and all of the rawness and emotional impact we've befriended Eastwood with lately is all gone. Morgan Freeman plays it straight as Nelson Mandela, and as he's become one of the modern world's ""untouchables"" we never get under his skin much more than we'd get from watching another news clip of him, and when it comes to Matt Damon's stale performance, there's really not much to say. The film is all done with an assured hand, and it's all neat and comfortable, and so it feels like it's directed by Ron Howard, and that's not a good thing."

","An example of what happens when good intentions kill a movie dead.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" is tasteful, reverent and serious, all qualities that would make for a great funeral eulogy but which do not necessarily make for riveting filmmaking. Morgan Freeman plays South African president Nelson Mandela capably and actually manages to avoid turning him into a wax-work version of the real-life figure, a trap another actor might have fallen into. But Eastwood's film is thuddingly boring, not translating one ounce of the inspirational vigor this story should.<br/><br/>The final half hour or so of the film depicts a famous rugby match that saw the South African team win the world cup, a victory in which Mandela had the foresight to see an opportunity to unite South Africans in a moment of national pride. But the game itself is edited poorly, simply showing random bouts of action interspersed with reaction shots from spectators, so that we never know where we are in the game, what any one play means, or even that the game is close to being over until it actually is. And Eastwood should have his rights to use slow motion revoked forever -- the device is used so relentlessly during the film's climax that it almost becomes a parody.<br/><br/>Matt Damon tackles a South African accent as captain of the rugby team. Damon is a fine actor, but how he managed to get nominated for an Academy Award for this performance is beyond me.<br/><br/>""Invictus"" has all the excitement of a high school civics textbook.<br/><br/>Grade: D"

","It is correct that nobody could play Mandela other than Morgan Freeman! Not mentioned as often is the outstanding portrayal of Captain Francois Pinnear by Matt Damon. This is a supporting role, but truly one of the finest roles of his career.<br/><br/>I think it is time for supporting actor Kgorgorge to move into lead roles. He was absolutely captivating in his commitment to protecting Mandela. The roles played by all the others in supporting roles were precious and perfect, especially Brenda and Mary.In short, since it is a Clint Eastwood movie, it is perfectly cast, down to the sports/new announcer. The editing appears seamless. The aerial shots of the mountains and coastal areas of CapeTown serve to emphasize the isolation of this metropolitan area.<br/><br/>A favorite whether or not every detail is factually accurate."

","Invictus tells the story of how Nelson Mandela (Freeman) join South Africa's rugby team captain Francois Pienaar (Damon) to help unite their country through Rugby's World Cup and making them world champions. This is a very enjoyable movie. It has the exactly amount of drama without falling into something corny. The story is quite interesting, it catches you from the very beginning and the plot is very well developed and the addition of original footage gives the movie a sense of reality. Although the rhythm is a bit slow, the film never turns tiresome or boring. Directed by Clint Eastwood, he really manage to tell us an inspiring story without to much pretensions The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman is Nelson Mandela, his performance is simply flawless, Matt Damon in the role of Francois Pienaar is very convincing and the secondary roles of Tony Kgoroge (Jason Tshabalala), Patrick Mofokeng ( Linga Moonsamy), Matt Stern (Hendrick Booyens), Julian Lewis Jones (Etienne Feyder), Adjoa Andoh (Brenda Mazibuko), Marguerite Wheatley (Nerine) and Leleti Khumalo (Mary) were of very good help to the development of the movie. In conclusion, Invictus is a very interesting, inspiring and enjoyable movie. I totally recommend it"

","As a fellow South African no longer living in South Africa and having Rugby very close to my heart this movie is an inspiration to watch. Having had the pleasure of meeting President Mandela (Madiba) and also having met briefly the South African Rugby team for 1995, this movie hits home and deep in my heart.<br/><br/>A good depiction of what was going on then. South Africa was crying out for a single act of unification. An act that would unite all colours under one banner and a single moment in history that defines the spirit, compassion and healing that South Africa was going through at the time.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman was perfect in his role as Madiba. I've met Madiba and Morgan pulled it off brilliantly. Matt Daymon also played his role well and it is not easy pulling off a movie like this.<br/><br/>Thank you to all the crew that made this film. Mandela wanted to feel a single moment in history of healing with the power of joy! This monumental feat and WIN for South Africa's Springboks and the way Madiba brought the country together using Rugby, was a time to remember.<br/><br/>Head this all out there in the world. South Africa is a tough place to grow up and South African's are proud of that.

","Today, I overheard someone saying 'I would go to a movie about a door opening if it was directed by Clint Eastwood'.<br/><br/>I feel the same although I am relieved Mr Eastwood has larger ideas, so it won't be necessary.<br/><br/>I almost chose to stay away from 'Invictus' because I have a natural aversion to rugby even though I have a Kiwi background steeped in All Black history. This is not a story about rugby. Rugby is part of the story.<br/><br/>Its a difficult story to tell to those uninformed about complex South African politics, the unique strength of Nelson Mandela, the strange game of rugby union which historically has created division & fanaticism.<br/><br/>The story is about a man who used divisive forces to bring about a sense of joy & hope. Its a movie about change and possibilities. Its about a man who thinks outside the square because of his own personal journey, using his power in the best way he can with a dignity and encouraging many to understand forgiveness & reconciliation.<br/><br/>For those who bemoan simplification; this particular movie demands specific, simple guidance for those unaware of this historical moment, but, I feel, many would be swept along in the current of a fascinating story in the steady hands of Mr Eastwood.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwoods development as a creative person is such a pleasure to watch, it will be the saddest day to lose his touch."

So I go for this show expecting it to be a documentary style movie. My expectations were low and had an open mind. But when the movie began, it gripped so much that I was fully immersed into the scenes. I felt I was amongst them, the South Africans.

","this for me is clint eastwoods best ever film as director. this film is a real winner, great performance by Morgan Freeman as mandela and indeed by matt Damon as Francois Pinaar the South African Rugby captain. This is a classier version of another sporting movie I saw a year or so ago (Goal II) which deserved something but got nothing. There is so much about this film that you will enjoy and you don't have to be a Rugby fan to enjoy it (or to understand the rules of Rugby because they are explained for you (and mandela) briefly in the movie.<br/><br/>I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie shortly after seeing (End Game) (about how mandela was catapulted into power)and The Blind Side (which has nothing to do with this movie at all except it deals with blacks and whites in sport and has a sporting theme re American football).<br/><br/>The PLAYERS trip to mandelas cell on the eve of the big match and the plane flying over the stadium are great moments and even the little quieter moments of the coloured maid in the Pinaar family household was dramatic and well handled.<br/><br/>There was nothing bad in this movie, lots of predictability but those who knew the result of the 1995 Final wont be in any way disappointed. We all love Lomu, even the English. The mixing of the real and alternative action smacked of Goal II, hence my reference to that and Eastwood must have got his ideas from that film to use the filming and the commentaries etc.<br/><br/>I lost the film a bit on the new South African anthem which the players rejected to sing and I certainly would have liked to have seen scenes of how patriotic the players really were in the build up to the matches, especially the final. what we saw and focused on was mandela greeting the players.<br/><br/>Clearly, as mandela was used in 'End Game', mandela himself was using the World Cup and Pinaar as a political vehicle to unite his country and sport. If there was a weakness, it was that pinaars character was not researched enough and was too shallow and perhaps Freeman overplayed the Mandela intentions, but the film works and it is a wonderful film to watch, even when the credits are coming up, stay till the very end because the very end is as important as the beginning."

","Clint Eastwood can seemingly do no wrong as this is yet another masterpiece from the veteran actor and director. A strong cast, including Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon. Portrayed is the the conversion of a lackluster South Africa national rugby union team to 1995 Rugby World Cup winners and focus for a reborn South Africa.<br/><br/>The setting and music paints an image of a bitterly divided country being gently brought together. Echos of apartheid linger and Nelson Mandela artfully turns the Springboks from a symbol of white South Africa to the team of the nation. Music and stadium scenes are quite overwhelming, while scenes of the mostly white team touring the black townships and building bonds with the children of black South Africa are heartwarming to say the least."
"aschein81","9","3","5","13 December 2009"," Less is more! Amazing, restrained directing by Eastwood!
","This film was simply so well directed by Eastwood. He has already won the Best Director Award from the National Board of Review, and he certainly will be one of the favorites for it at the Oscars, along with James Cameron and Jason Reitman. <br/><br/>Where do I start? This film is so unlike most other sports films out there for a lot of reasons, mostly because Eastwood doesn't try to manipulate your emotions with phony ""tearjerker"" scenes or scenes with some kind of phony conflicts/crises between characters. In many ways the film is kind of boring in that it is relatively quiet and free of any kind of loud sounds, drama, or music. When the musical score does appear, it appears sporadically and is rather quiet and serene. It is very much directed like a low budget documentary, where Eastwood is only interested in telling how, when, and where this story took place, along with who was affected. He doesn't do what an inferior director would do, which is add in more dramatic scenes involving Mandela's or Pennier's family life to try to add more romance to the film, or try to make the Rugby World Cup tournament into some kind of amazing event that resolved all of South Africa's problems. Also, when the game is over at the end, we simply see Freeman and Damon shake hands and say thank you to each other for about 15 seconds, then they walk away from each other. No one is carried off the field, and the South Africa team is never really portrayed as an underdog. None of the players on the other team taunt them or even speak to them, and we never see much of a montage of the playoffs leading up to the big game. Also, no player or coach dies right before the big game (typical phony conflict to try to manipulate your emotions). There's way less of any of these things than other directors would do. There are no close-ups of their faces with tears running down their cheeks, or any real dramatic dialogue. Eastwood isn't trying to make them both superheroes, as a lesser director would do. He's just trying to show that is one event helped bring the people of South Africa together for at least a short time, and that's all. <br/><br/>Eastwood simply goes by the old ""less is more"" strategy in ever way he directs this film. Like I stated earlier, the film is close to being boring because of the lack of any loud sounds or surprise dramatic developments. My favorite part of the whole film, and this is somewhat of a spoiler, was the entire championship game at the end, which seemed to last at least 20 minutes or so. During this 20 minute climax, the film suddenly turns into basically a silent film without any dialogue, with Eastwood just going back and forth between the action on the field and people watching on TV from their homes all over South Africa. This dialogue free time, with some beautiful music in the background was simply amazing art, and took away any of the typical sports ""cliches"" that other directors would have used during this time. Damon gives a ""let's go"" type of pep talk to the team near the end of the game, but that pep talk was only about 15 seconds, whereas other directors would have made that scene probably a minute or two, with tears dripping down players cheeks, to try to manipulate your emotions.<br/><br/>The performances by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are excellent, with a certain Oscar nomination for Morgan Freeman specifically. The cinematography was well done, as the film was filmed entirely on location. However, the star of this baby is really Eastwood, as his style is so free of manipulation or gimmicks. He truly respects the audience's intelligence by not shoving material or dramatic events down our throat. Instead, he backs off and lets us ingest the scenes, interpret them, and allow them to mean whatever we as the audience want them to mean. This is film directing at its finest."

","I love sports movies. I like political movies. I should love Invictus, right? I didn't. The message of the movie (Don't hate others b/c of the way they look, exceed your own expectations) could've been told in half the time. Actually, I just told the message in 1/800th the time. The reason this matters is that the movie was just really boring. The message is a good one, but it was delivered so poorly that I wish I could've just had someone read my own paraphrase to me. At least I would have given a point for succinctness. A major example of the poor delivery - when the final competition happened, I was surprised since the buildup was really weak. I thought it was still a qualifying match. I was really looking forward to the grand final and then the movie was over.<br/><br/>I don't like being so negative, so here are some positives: Matt Damon did a good job, and it was interesting to see him looking so muscled (PEDs?). Morgan Freeman has a nice voice. The jogging suits the team wore looked nice and flashy. I now know a rule from rugby.<br/><br/>One major positive of the film is the music. Anytime you can hear Serengeti music with the beat of Africa shining through, it's a great thing. AAAA-BA-DEEEEENG-AAAA!!!!! I plan on buying the soundtrack."

","After being imprisoned for thirty years, a man steps out of a tiny cell, and he is ready to forgive the people who put him there. Invictus is a movie that inspires greatness. It's difficult to see this film and remain unaffected by such a heartwarming and inspirationally true story. <br/><br/>In every moment of the film, you can feel the relaxed hand of Eastwood, painting this rich and important story with his trademark of gracefulness and understatement. With each film that he makes, Eastwood sheds a new layer of his vision. His ideas and consummate understanding of the world gel, and through his talent, they become magnificent pieces of storytelling that will be talked about for a long time. As his career advances, Eastwood's films only get better; they're mature and always from the heart. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's performance of Mandela is so fluent that he disappears in the persona and becomes almost unrecognizable in the role. He had been preparing for this role since the early 1990s when the two of them met and the President confessed his personal desire for Freeman to be his sole on-screen counterpart. He believed that Freeman would be the ""right"" man to play him in a film. After almost twenty years of on-and-off preparation, the performance is flawless. Freeman is like a chameleon; he becomes Mandela.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is extraordinary. Physically, he does not look like Pienaar, but he embodies the spirit of the man. In each of his scenes, you see a man's conscience burning within him, driving him to satisfy his hunger for greatness. Mandela's vision inspires him to lead and become the example that everyone looks to for hope.<br/><br/>The film is about lots of things, but for no other reason, why not see a film that educates us in what it truly means to be human? Unconditional love and compassion for all. I do not care what the Oscars have to say--this film is a winner."
"zabokrugby8","8","2","3","28 June 2013"," The Good, the Bad and the Rugby
","Had far too many reservations about even viewing this film let alone singing its praises; from the outset, I didn't think it had a snowball's chance in hell of any success. Hollywood or otherwise. But I was wrong.<br/><br/>Along came Clint Eastwood. Sure, the seasoned director with a meticulous eye for detail, rode onto the highveld and Joburg with high hopes. He knew a good script when handed one. But Clint was not alone. The big gun was wary. Make that wise. To placate any doubts, he hired gunslingers, er, good help: Morgan Freeman more than stepped up to play the role of Nelson Mandela; the veteran actor stood tall, and often in the breach. Early on, Freeman almost morphed and even became 'the New South Africa's' first black President. To wit, Freeman's manner, expression,speech and Xhosa accent mirrored those of the larger than life image of the real man. At least on camera.<br/><br/>On the other side of the racial divide, Matt Damon, as Springbok Rugby Captain Francois Pienaar even lent Mandela his capable, and strong hands Although bourne of the Boer identity, Pienaar relished his helper role in setting the old Republik on a new, shining path into former uncharted territory: forgiveness and reconciliation.<br/><br/>The end game was not that the Springboks must win and become the 1995 Rugby World Champions and hoist the coveted Ellis Cup. No... That was a corollary or pretense to a loftier even more more laudable platitude: unite, actually anoint the nation under a Rainbow Coalition of racial harmony.And rugby, that cherished Afrikaaner tradition forever shrouded in those nefarious (to the native masses) green and gold jerseys was the preferred if not unwitting vehicle to accomplish such a noble undertaking. No doubt, Pienaar, knew something 'big' was about to happen. He had a good feeling. As did Mandela. The two disparate men soon became close friends. At times, almost inseparable. If not insuperable. That is the 'right' stuff for good even great beginnings.<br/><br/>Now, to address the bad...<br/><br/>Nothing really egregious. We owe that to Clint: he stuck (or was mired in) to the script. It was all about Nelson Mandela: his coming out as President, his time in the sun, or under the spotlight, so to speak. And Mandela deserved his star treatment. After all, Nelson as a founding member of then banned ANC party spent his best years, almost 27 (at one point, Matt, increased the punishment to 30 years) incarcerated for treasonous crimes against the state on a wretched rock pile, marooned away from civilization but safe from 'open' apartheid, on Robben island. The constant fawning over Madiba the President is the film's one (minor) shortcoming. Although at times, we do catch some strong even poignant glimpses of the majority blacks ire with Mandela for donning the green and gold jersey and his total commitment to winning the hallowed Webb Ellis Rugby World Cup. However, in aggregate, those didn't even amount to a skirmish let alone full blown civil disobedience.<br/><br/>Along the same lines, we learn little if anything at all from/about the Boers (Afrikaaners). To wit, we hear nothing from them regarding their prospects/objections to achieving a workable partnership with their new 'baases': the formerly oppressed native masses. Also disturbing, not one white South African, neither Boer or English is seen raising his fist nor is heard out of ignorance (or otherwise) shouting a racial slur or otherwise pointed objection to Mandela's scrum filled ambitions. Too good to be true? Maybe not. My impression, er, Clint's projection: the entire nation had gone rugby mad. Which was good for the script...<br/><br/>Which lead straight into the rugby matches. Although the Springbok squad reached rock bottom at the tournament's beginning and we're not given even the slightest chance of making it out of the group stages to the quarter finals (we're often reminded of the experts' pessimistic assessment by a mustachioed and cheeky Afrikaaner sportscaster), the grand stage was set. The stadium props were built Bok solid. All the while the pressure for the hosts to win mounted. And the warthog Boks finally got their true inspiration. It came in the unlikely form of Mandela's favorite poem:Invictus.<br/><br/>Transcribed by Mandela's own pen, the epic literary piece was hand delivered personally by captain Pienaar. The veteran Bok captain, though blurted out the sacred passages' 'true' meaning to his love interest when questioned about his special mission...<br/><br/>""I think he wants us to win the World Cup.""<br/><br/>Lights out. You really thought Clint wouldn't insert a gratuitous love scene? Well, Matt is human. And Hollywood still calls all the shots (in the dark). Clint's squinting, twitching eyes notwithstanding..."

The springboks are the official rugby team of South Africa. They were composed of white men except Chester Williams. The captain of the springboks was Francois Pinaar.

","Prior to seeing this film, I knew very little about the 1995 Rugby World Cup, apartheid, the Springboks, Nelson Mandela nor Francois Piennar. This was in fact the first film I had watched directed by Clint Eastwood, and I left impressed. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this, it is merely a backdrop to the overall story of the end of apartheid and the coming together of black and white people. Morgan Freeman is casted brilliantly as Nelson Mandela and played the role down to a tee. He does look like him in my opinion. Despite knowing very little of what happened, I was entranced by the scene when the Springboks went to Robben Island Prison were Mandela was incacerated for 27 years. Hearing the lines of Invictus while Piennar (Matt Damon) was in Mandela's cell was superb film making. <br/><br/>It is truly superb, but not perfect film.

Though not a fan of the A.N.C. and having reservations about Mr. Mandela himself, I have no shame in admitting I was moved to tears a number of times. Pres. Mandela is rightly portrayed as a statesman and a mensch who averted disaster and bloodshed upon the dismantling of the reprehensible Apartheid regime.<br/><br/>The message conveyed through this picture gives hope, particularly to those of us in the Middle East.

","This movie is just amazing and truly inspirational. I didn't watch it until today and i've no shame to say that this is a masterpiece!<br/><br/>The story is really touching. Imagine that: an Apartheid ex-prisoner becomes president of the Republic of South Africa and to unite his country, calls his rugby national team, symbol of the segregation since its creation, to win the world Cup which occurred next year in their own country.<br/><br/>Nelson Mandela is such an example for the world. And what a great portrayer as Morgan Freeman. He really enlightens the movie from the beginning to the end. Morgan Freeman's play suffers no excess and show really modesty in this movie. It's quite funny to see him stop an important meeting to watch his rugby team or his own bodyguards white and blacks to start playing each other, as disbelief of his staff.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is really great too, less impressive than Freeman but still great. I'm sure it must be hard to learn Rugby for someone who came from the Football country. <br/><br/>The final scene with all the south African people celebrating the victory is really really powerful, showing the dimension of what just happened. <br/><br/>Seriously, This is just a huge one and it really deserves the note!"

To do this he believes that having the Springbosk the nickname of the South Africa national rugby win the Rugby World Cup that was being hosted in their country that year.<br/><br/>The rugby game scenes are truly well shot and put together scenes that really make you sit on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what'll happen next."

","Being a Clint Eastwood movie, I definitely had high expectations going into this one. And the movie more than lives up to ones expectations in all aspects. It is based on true events related to the initial struggle of Nelson Mandela to form a 'Rainbow Nation' when he became the President of South Africa. The storyline is pretty simple backed by good performances and direction. Also the movie unravels at a good pace. It has its own moments of joy and triumph.<br/><br/>It is truly one of the most inspirational movies one would ever come across.

"Likes_Ninjas90","8","2","3","28 January 2010"," It is so much more thought provoking and politically aware than it may seem on the surface
","Invictus is set during the early 90s as Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is released from prison and then elected into office as the President of South Africa. South Africa at this time is divided by the contempt the blacks and whites hold for each other. Despite the objections of his office, Mandela pursues the game of Rugby as a means of uniting the country again. The national team is a disgrace though, lacking the ability to compete in matches, despite the best efforts of the captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). Before he can address the issues of crime and poverty, Mandela views the game as a means of establishing an initial platform of unity for blacks and whites to live peacefully together again. He meets with Francois to inspire him to lift his team so that they can compete with some pride for the 1995 World Cup.<br/><br/>As an American filmmaker, Clint Eastwood came into this project with very little knowledge of Rugby Union. He stated that he had an uncle who played in the twenties but he insisted on researching the game himself by watching the students at The University of California at Berkeley practice. Invictus, the word meaning invincible in Latin, is far more than just a sporting film though. Rather, it is a examination of a country torn by conflict and the need for a passive resolution. When Mandela is told by a staff member that it is just a political calculation he states sharply that 'it is a human calculation', reflecting his concern for the lives of the individuals of his nation and the hope that the game can inspire. As with his most recent films, the skill that Eastwood brings to Invictus is indicative of his talent and experience in film-making. The film was photographed on location in Cape Town and Johannesburg by Eastwood's regular cinematographer Tom Stern and it looks particularly magnificent. The beautiful clean shots, long associated with Eastwood as a classicist filmmaker, have an expansive quality to them, projecting the harsh landscapes and the impoverished shanty homes. Eastwood has paced the film impeccably too, as despite the scope of the subject matter, it rarely lulls in its compelling nature, detailing the removal and reinstatement of the colours of the Springbok, the tension between Mandela's own security staff, Mandela's health and imprisonment and the gradual progression of the football team itself.<br/><br/>One of Eastwood's greatest assets as a director is the relationship he holds with his selection and control of his actors. Both Freeman and Damon are fine choices here. The former has a particular resemblance to the real Mandela and brings his physical fragility to the foray as well. His performance displays passion for his country but also smaller details, like the kindness and warmth he shows to his staff, to make him a more rounded reflection of Mandela. As this is not a autobiographical film about Mandela though, the relationship between his family is only hinted at and his voice is said by some to not be quite as accurate. Others have felt that his dialogue is too reflective of the films messages of liberating the country. Regardless, it is still highly contextual for Mandela to demonstrate to his plans and his vision for the country to his staff and doubters alike. Matt Damon has a near-perfect South African accent and he too physically enhances his role by bulking up to look like a Rugby player. He is surprisingly credible in this film, which along with The Informant! last year, demonstrates his range as more than just an action star.<br/><br/>The sporting scenes throughout Invictus have thankfully been filmed with as much precision as the rest of the film. Even if one does not understand the rules of Rugby, the frequent glances at the scoreboard during the matches ensure that it is still easy to understand. All of the matches are filmed with ferociousness, capturing the crunching tackles and thunderous hits. It is pleasing that Eastwood has shown his maturity here but not overloading these scenes with shaky hand-held cameras that distort ones view, like in other films. The tension here and the spectacle of some of the rapid passes and tries scored makes one question why the current state of Rugby isn't as fun or as exciting as this. Regardless of whether this seems like a conventional sporting rags to riches story, the themes and the message that are generated from this story are more significant than those regularly associated with the sporting genre. The way that an impoverished black child is allowed to move closer and closer to the radio of a white officers cop car over the course of the match is reflective of the excitement and national pride that the game brings to the country. It is certainly about more than just winning and coming out on top.<br/><br/>Invictus might not be as powerful or as hard-hitting as some of Eastwood's more challenging and devastatingly emotional films of recent years, but its heart is still firmly in the right place. The messages here are ones of universal interest, stressing Eastwood's more liberal views of recent years and the ability of nations of conflict to resolve their differences peacefully. This is a film that so many people will relish and respond to if they are willing to view this as more than just a film about Rugby. It is so much more thought provoking and politically aware than it may seem on the surface."

","I remember first hearing about the biopic Clint Eastwood was doing on Nelson Mandela with Morgan Freeman in the role and instantly knew I wanted to see the film. To find out it was about the world cup of rugby and Mandela leading the campaign for South Africa to win the title I wasn't so sure if I was as enthused as before. I was wrong. Sure, this movie has everything your typical sports drama does. Sentimentality, coming from behind to beat all odds, but through the rugby you see Mandela's vision for his racially divided country. I loved the first half of this movie leading up to the final game of the World Cup. From the opening scene seeing the black children playing soccer, and the white children playing rugby. Then to see Mandela drive by just after being freed from prison. It set the tone for the entire movie.<br/><br/>While this isn't a masterpiece by any stretch, I feel it accurately captured what Mandela meant to South Africa and the world. Morgan Freeman plays the role not as an impersonation, but as an embodiment that should definitely net him an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

"GethinVanH","Null","2","3","26 December 2009"," Politics and sports come together decently
","I don't like many of Eastwood's emotionally cloying films like ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"". Emotional harp strings are played frequently in those movies.<br/><br/>Invictus is quite different. The movie is a biopic but it's not a biopic, it's about one part of Mandela's life. It's a very small part, the 1995 Rugby World Cup which was held in South Africa. This is a risky move, but this is in fact better than doing a complete biopic of Mandela's life. I would compare this movie to last year's Frost/Nixon, it's a glimpse of the man's life, a part of his life deemed important not by the man himself but by his biographers.<br/><br/>Freeman is quite good but his accent is a bit flaky at times. Damon is alright as well but he doesn't have much to work with here as the captain of the South Africa Rugby squad. A lot of it is working up his teammates and convincing them that there is a political purpose behind their team winning.<br/><br/>There is still some manipulation here as there always in Eastwood's films. A plane flies over at one point and the music gets all ominous and tense. Your first thought is 'OH MY GOD, IT'S THE TERRORISTS' but it's subterfuge on Eastwood's part, as usual.<br/><br/>The musical score is also quite bad in a few places. Instead of going with a traditional instrumental score, there are bad pieces of modern adult contemporary music.<br/><br/>Overall it's a pretty decent movie and I liked Freeman in his role as Mandela, I can't imagine anyone else really taking on this role. Maybe there is a South African actor out there who could do it. There are South African actors in this movie and it's really quite hard to understand their accent at times."
"Monotreme02","7","2","3","26 December 2009"," Good and effective, great performances, but generally run-of-the-mill
","For the past decade or so, Clint Eastwood has had one of the most consistently high-quality outputs out of any director working today – and aside from Robert Altman and maybe one or two more earlier in the decade, he is also the oldest one of the bunch. It was an absolute treat to see a director reach the twilight of his career and bloom with the vitality and energy of a young director just getting his big break. Eastwood's films this past decade have been big, potent epics of emotion, from the Shakespearian characters in Mystic River to the down-and-dirty determinists in Million Dollar Baby to the subtle honor of the stars of Letters from Iwo Jima. Eastwood was always so careful in selecting his powerful, dramatic subjects over the past few years – which is why the vanilla-coated glossiness of Invictus seems completely out of place in his oeuvre.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect of this film is without a doubt the cast. To Eastwood's credit, subject matter like this – big, epic historical biopics – do usually tend to ham it up when it comes to acting and very often enter the level of theatrics and over-performing. Luckily, Eastwood is at least too smart to fall into that trap, and both lead actors in the film – Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, who actually plays more of a supporting character, but no matter – deliver quite subtle and yet totally effective performances, despite the fact that they are playing larger-than-life characters with real-world counterparts. This renders the performances less bombastic and showy than what has come to be expected from these types of roles – I especially expected Freeman to turn this into one of those ""roles of a lifetime"" things – but they are still emotionally powerful and admirably subtle turns from two of our greatest actors, especially Damon who is most effective and one of the most underrated performers working today.<br/><br/>As to the film itself, it's not that it's bad in any way; it's a really good and effective drama that depicts an important event in world history and covers a lot of emotional and political ground in a very simple and concise premise. There are some truly powerful scenes – such as the first time Freeman's Nelson Mandela steps onto the Rugby field and is met with a pretty noticeably equal mix of cheers and boos from the crowd. My one real problem with the film is that it takes a very important and complicated political atmosphere – post-Apartheid South Africa and the reconciliation efforts on the part of Nelson Mandela to bring the blacks and the whites together and to unify his country – and just blatantly over-simplifies it and sugarcoats it. And I think that the screenplay is to blame: its lack of harmony and emotional balance is really noticeable. I felt that scenes depicting the racial tension suffered from the ""Crash"" effect: put the problems so dead center – and solved them so easily and without too much suffering – that they never really got the heart of it. I also felt that something was a little off in the rugby scenes: Eastwood has shown a newfound energy and vitality in his recent films, but the scenes depicting the rugby games in the film just felt stiff, and lacked the immediacy of better-edited sequences in the likes of Friday Night Lights. To sum it up, I think that when a science fiction film manages to deal far more seriously and deeply with the same themes as an important historical drama such as this one, something is definitely lacking."
"jacobson98","9","2","3","24 December 2009"," Excellent Film!
","Not only did I love this movie, but so did my wife who knows little about rugby and hates sports movies. It's not really a sports movie but rather an example of political leadership. With Clint Eastwood directing it's historically accurate and makes its points quietly and without over dramatization. Someone unaware of the history of South Africa during the 1980s and 1990s might struggle to understand what's happening but the movie will quietly answer all your questions although it might make you wait awhile and it will make you think. Morgan Freeman commands the screen while underplaying, the kind of trick that brings award nominations. Matt Damon is brings immense tension to a quiet part. The star of the movie is the simple idea of reaching across to black/white divide to bond over what had been a sport mainly for South African whites. This movie is yet another reminder that Clint Eastwood has become the most dependable and most accomplished American director."

","This is what I love about Clint Eastwood's films.In my opinion they're not made to be action blockbusters, they're not made to break records in gross revenue; they're made to inspire and educate. ""Invictus"" tells the story of Nelson Mandela trying to unite an oppressed and divided nation through the South African rugby team. I have to say that the football is not the most engaging piece of work in the film (this is coming from a rugby player and avid rugby fan), but it's the themes derived from this film that make it worth watching. Forget everyone that criticizes Morgan Freeman, he was exceptionally brilliant, one of his best performances to date. The film's title is derived from an old English poem, and it's connection to the film's story only strengthens the true message of one's strength, and him/her fighting for it, to help not only him/herself, but others in the process also."

","Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) becomes President of South Africa and vows to the people that the Country will never be the skunk of the world again. Becoming attracted to the sport of Rugby he contacts the captain of the South Africa spring league Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to bring greatness and inspiration to his country.<br/><br/>For some people in order to give them inspiration to become great they need something to inspire them and that's what happened as shown in this film based on a true story. I have always thought the little things count in life weather it be helping out with a food shelf or giving people money, but to help the people of a Country is a big weight to put on your shoulders. To see joy and happiness in people's faces is a blessing from above and a blessing that if you have the power to give can in the end become a beautiful thing. Many people liked to be known for something or make a stand and a change. That is what I think Mandela did and the message Eastwood wanted to show in this powerful reincarnation of the true story.<br/><br/>Freeman in this movie is so convincing to be the real Nelson Mandela. Even though there were some parts in the movie that were funny to me which I think were put in there to make the people laugh and enjoy the movie more and not make it all too serious. The only African-American actor/actress to appear in three Best Picture Oscar Winners: ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). I have always seen Freeman as a man who stars in those thriller roles which make you cringe and as a down to earth guy that almost anyone can relate to.<br/><br/>Damon plays his role well and without knowing the real person has a convincing yet honorable role as the captain of the South Africa Rugby Team of 1995. Something you may not know about Daman is that he dropped out of Harvard 12 credits short of graduating to pursue his acting career. Which I think is kind of a funny fact, because he became an actor anyways from not graduating there. I have always known Daman for his roles in Drama as well as Action films such as ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997), ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999), ""The Bourne Trillogy"" movies (2002/2004/2007). Always playing the, I am tough guy willing to knock out a guy to get answers which would have served him well if he was given a role in the bond movies. I just think that wouldn't have fit his persona maybe though.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, a living legend, best known for his roles in ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004) and ""Gran Torino"" (2008) directs this film which actually is based off a true story off Nelson Mandela and the South Africa Rugby team. Even though Eastwood is done with his acting career, he will continue his directing of movies such as this one. Already having received an award from the National Board of Review for Best actor Morgan Freeman and Best Director Clint Eastwood it is nominated for 3 Golden Globes and another 3 wins and 8 nominations."

","Clint Eastwood's movies have always had the ability to take us into another time and space. And he does so in Invictus as well. But certainly not as well as in Unforgiven and in Changeling or any of his other great movies.<br/><br/>What he does do well here is to remind us of the power of the human spirit in the person of Nelson Mandela. Though the movie is primarily about South Africa's challenge in winning the rugby World Cup against insurmountable odds, I found the story of Mandela's emergence from prison to prominence and power equally as fascinating. His desire to forgive his oppressors and to captain his country gives the story of a half-baked rugby team some real meat.<br/><br/>Freeman's accent was certainly questionable but that of Matt Damon's was nearly flawless.<br/><br/>Eastwood didn't give us emotional scenes for their own sake, he allowed us to witness history recreated and the emotions came from its realism.<br/><br/>In spite of the movie's optimism, there was still an underlying unrest and distrust in the country. The Afrikaaners did not surrender power easily. Hundreds of years of minority rule plied on the backs of the indigenous Africans spoiled the children and grandchildren of the long-ruling Dutch into indecency. The initial discomfort between the white and black Presidential Security Detail well demonstrates that.<br/><br/>Kudos to Eastwood for allowing us to once again look into a culture not our own and enriching us in the process."

"Paddy-49","8","1","1","1 April 2011"," Sport as a metaphor for life on the largest of stages
","Whatever the problems of modern day South Africa, and there are plenty, the progress that the country has made in the twenty years since Nelson Mandela was released is pretty astonishing. A once pariah nation has taken its rightful place in the community of Nations - not least in sport with its hosting of the three main World Cup tournaments - Rugby, Cricket and Football. The first of these, the Rugby World Cup in 1995, was an act of faith on the part of the international Rugby Union authorities - it could have gone horribly wrong. ""Invictus"" shows why it didn't - from an organisational and security aspect and, more parochially, from the perspective of the new ""Rainbow Nation"" itself.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is that the event was a success because of two men - Mandela himself and the South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar. The former extended the hand of friendship to his once bitter enemies in the rugby mad Afrikaner community. The latter, an Afrikaner himself, not only grabbed his President's offered hand but fought the institutionalised prejudice of his family, his team and his people to argue for the maximum co-operation with their country's first and greatest black leader. Mandela had not only his former jailers to deal with - he also had to persuade his own African people that retribution against the Afrikaners would be counter-productive. For example and well portrayed in the film, he had to convince them that it would be right to continue with the Springbok name and colours for the South African rugby team.<br/><br/>Rugby, as shown in the movie, was a metaphor for the challenge South Africa faced post Apartheid. The game in the republic was exclusively white, elitist and predominantly Afrikaner. It was in many ways a symbol for oppression and separate development - the blacks had soccer on rough ground in the townships. The whites had rugby on manicured grass in great stadia in the cities. Rugby was played behind well-guarded gates of the elite schools. Soccer was played on any old piece of dirt. If the black majority was aware of rugby at all it was to cheer on whoever the Springboks were playing - better England than the hated racists of Afrikanerdom. Nelson Mandela knew that if he was to succeed with the highly sceptical white community post democracy, a community where he was still to many a ""terrorist"", then he needed an ally. This is where Pienaar came in.<br/><br/>Francois Pienaar had inherited, as Captain, a South African rugby team that was low on confidence and despite being the hosts was seen as having little chance in the 1995 World Cup. The media was highly sceptical of the team's prospects and the team itself was struggling to come to terms with the new world of South Africa. When asked to do some coaching in a township they dismissed it as a joke - and were openly contemptuous of the idea that the blacks could even play the game. Pienaar knew that the motor for change could be the charismatic President and Mandela genuinely moved him with his decency and lack of rancour about the past. Asked about his philosophy of leadership Pienaar said that it was ""by example"" - on and off the field. Rather a Mandelan philosophy as well. This approach combined with some astute selections, including Chester Williams, the first black Springbok, meant that South Africa entered the tournament with a fighting chance. A win over favoured Australia in the opening match set the tone and the Springboks made it to the Final. Here they faced a New Zealand team who had eased effortlessly to the Final - not least because they had the awesome giant try-machine Jonah Lomu in their ranks.<br/><br/>The match sequences in ""Invictus"" are arguably the best ever seen in a movie about sport. Even the most knowledgeable rugby aficionado will find nothing to quarrel with about the portrayal of the matches - and the Final, which goes on for five minutes or more, is wonderfully portrayed. It was one of those matches where afterwards the cliché ""You couldn't make it up"" was frequently used. Even though we know the result the tension is extraordinary and the moment when President Mandela appears in a Springbok shirt before the match is surely an iconic moment in history - and not just rugby history. South Africa's win with a drop goal in extra time seems now to be pre-ordained. But that is certainly not how it felt at the time! Whether there is some poetic licence in ""Invictus"" I don't know - perhaps there is. But it has an authentic feel to it throughout from the portrayal of the interpersonal challenges that Mandela and Pienaar faced and overcame through to the match sequences it has the ring of truth about it. It is an uplifting film in every way with truly remarkable performances from Morgan Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar. These two Americans, along with Director Clint Eastwood, might not know much about rugby, but they clearly knew someone who does. And they certainly know a great story when they see one - and they tell it with sensitivity, feeling and drama."

"bandw","8","1","1","10 October 2010"," Nelson Mandela, viewed from an oblique angle
","Nelson Mandela is such a towering figure of the 20th century and his life story so dramatic that you would expect any story dealing with him would tend toward an epic biopic. However, in this movie Clint Eastwood gives us insight into the man by focusing on his involvement in the 1995 Rugby World Cup hosted by South Africa, just a year after Mandela was elected President.<br/><br/>Mandela's wisdom and foresight is exemplified by his approach to the South African Rugby team, the Springboks. Mandela wanted to capitalize on the world spotlight being on South Africa for the World Cup. Even though rugby had been a sport appreciated mainly by whites, Mandela wanted the team to win and be supported by the entire country, black and white. By supporting the team and refusing to change its name this would be a symbol to the world that indeed things were changing in South Africa. <br/><br/>To accomplish his goals Mandela sought the support of the rugby team captain, François Pienaar. Mandela's encouragement and inspiration to Pienaar was no small factor in the Springbok's upset win over New Zealand.<br/><br/>Almost as asides we see how adroitly Mandela handled the transition of power, how he was determined not to form a government of retribution for past sins, as feared by many whites, but rather to try to work together with all races. The movie shows how many whites moved from fear to acceptance of Mandela and his policies.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Mandela with quiet dignity, which I think is truly the essence of the man. However, a certain impishness is seen as well. And one senses the sadness of the effects of Mandela's 27 years of imprisonment. That is not dwelled on here--it is enough simply to see the actual prison cell for us to get some sense of the enormity of Mandela's strength of character. From what we see in this film it is not difficult to imagine the farsighted vision Mandela had in creating the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. A politician who puts the welfare of his country over partisanship seems to be a rare quality.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is also in good form in his portrayal of François Pienaar. I don't know how accurate his accent is, but it sounded right to me.<br/><br/>The Rugby World Cup is not just the backdrop used to reveal character in the protagonists, but it is filmed as a thrilling sporting event in and of itself. Since it follows the script of what actually happened, it has a much more powerful effect than those fictional sports movies where the underdog scores in the last seconds for a stunning victory. I know little about rugby and the main thing I took away from this movie is that it is a brutal sport.<br/><br/>I think that focusing on a specific event in Mandela's post-prison life was perhaps as effective in revealing the character of the man as an epic covering the full sweep of his life."

","Film reviewers in their self-appointed omniscience, occasionally tend to forget the obvious; for example that Invictus, Eastwood's 30th feature length film in 38 years isn't a study of south African politics, but a mere adaptation of a book about a political leader and a rugby game. New light through the old windows then Here is a film, magisterially constructed, stately executed, of course, about a man's political insight and the dedicated seriousness with which this insight must be served. Nothing frivolous or ""likeable"" about great Mr. Freeman's interpretation of the Man. Instead he builds a thoughtful diplomat, a passive aggressive person of gentle manners and obsessive persistence. Mr. Eastwood's only arguable decision – if I may – is his conscious attempt to portray a situation in its almost pedestrian, at times, reality, relieved of any real danger of things going the wrong way. For a director who never indulged in the suspenseless, this comes as a surprise Yet, on second thought, the game itself is not the issue at hand. Yes, it may occupy the grand finale and, plausibly apply the upbeat feeling, but Mr. Eastwood's cinema almost always is elsewhere: In the reintegration, understanding and affirmation of the Male, of the one who makes the necessary decisions to solidify the social web. And under this light, Invictus is one with the director's unmistakable canon."

","What makes this so much more than just another Cinderella/underdog sports story? The timing of this World Cup Rugby match. I don't pretend to understand Rugby, and you don't need to – it's really about how Nelson Mandela, soon after being released from prison, seizes an opportunity to use Rugby to help unite South Africa.<br/><br/>After years of repression, apartheid, white supremacy rule, the Blacks had elected Mandela as their new president of South Africa. Both white and black radicals wanted revenge, power – violence was breaking out. How to stop it? By using the very symbol of white racism – the Rugby team – Nelson Mandela gave everyone something they could support, a cause to rally behind. It ain't crazy if it works, and this actually worked. He got the blacks to see the rugby team as belonging to all of South Africa, no longer something that only the whites would watch. Morgan Freeman does a superb job portraying Nelson.<br/><br/>What makes this book work so well are the characters behind the history. Of course the successful change from white rule to free elections was made possible by more than just a rugby game, but this movie shows how many different approached Nelson Mandela used to ensure peace. The focus is on the people - the game, the politics and strife are more in the background. ** Possible Spoiler** This is still a Cinderella story, but rather a very compelling piece one where the stakes are much more than a championship. Very uplifting and motivating, that in of itself, makes for a good entertainment."

","Two-time Oscar Best Director winner Clint Eastwood (Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven) adapts for the screen John Carlin's book ""Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation"" with ""Invictus"".<br/><br/>In another Oscar nominated role as Nelson Mandela, Oscar Best Supporting Actor winner Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) portrays the South African President who, in his first term, starts a curious campaign to unify the country torn apart by racism by supporting the mostly white national rugby team to win the 1995 World Cup. Oscar Best Screenplay winner Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) is also nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as rugby team captain Francois Pienaar, who becomes Mandela's unlikely partner.<br/><br/>Eastwood tells this story like he's told his other movie gems: deliberately, bordering on overlong. He takes his time to explore each character and he often appeals to great emotion. Mandela is presented as 'a man, not a saint', touching painfully on his separation from his wife and estrangement from his daughter.<br/><br/>It's difficult not to like an underdog plot for a film, especially as a Filipino moviegoer such as myself who immediately latches on to parallelisms with South Africa's poverty and need for a strong leader, how rugby has served as an inspiring metaphor for unity just like our own boxing champ Manny Pacquiao has decreased crime rates whenever a match of his is on. <br/><br/>""Invictus"" isn't something the average escapist moviegoer will camp out to see; frankly, it sounds boring. After all, the title is of a poem most highschoolers have had to memorize and so may regard this as a 'required viewing' sort of flick. But whether or not you still remember the lines to the poem that aptly inspired Mandela's 'unconquerable soul', revisit it in context with a glimpse of the actual cell where Mandela stayed for almost 30 years and marvel how despite that experience, he is able to forgive his oppressors, something that is crucial to his goal of unity for his country. (If that still doesn't grab you, at least watch out for Eastwood's son Scott, who delivers the final kicks for the Springboks in their game against New Zealand.)"

","""Invictus"" is a good enough sports movie and a good enough political bio-pic, but not more than that. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman. I really need to see him play against type at least once. Maybe a male prostitute or something. Here he does what he always does, lately: play the stately elder who mentors usually white youths. Matt Damon is surprisingly good as a real life rugby player, Francois Pienaar, who, as a google image search quickly reveals, was much larger and more ferocious looking than Damon. Damon's South African accent is good, but, in the end, he's given little to do. The rugby scenes are appropriately inspirational.<br/><br/>The film's weak points are many. There are too many scenes of Nelson Mandela being handed paperwork by his lovely aid, signing the paperwork, and handing it back to his lovely aid. There is no appreciation of the South African landscape, or even Cape Town, one of the most spectacularly situated cities on earth. Nothing new is achieved in the field of filmed sports. If Clint Eastwood wanted to create a film with no memorable, arresting visual images, he certainly did. The film presents the situation in South Africa as black or white, and it's much more complicated than that. For example, Afrikaner settlement in predates Zulu settlement; and majority vote has been followed by very high crime rates, including utterly horrendous rape rates."

Every line Morgan Freeman says, in a powerful role as Nelson Mandela, comes across as cumbersome and unnatural, as if he were speaking for a debate class. The natural flow of the plot was continually interrupted by long, gratuitous speeches.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that many of the final scenes, and perhaps the whole last hour of the film, was powerful.

Granted there was already the ""Long walk to freedom"" movie that the film makers wanted to distinguish themselves from, but in the end the only analogy I can think of is they may as well have made a movie about ""Gandhi"" solely based on his supporting role in a regional cricket match between India and Pakistan ... years after all the really important political struggles and accomplishments that preceded it.

Eastwood doesn't look for the most innovative way to shoot his film - which seems to be the biggest complaint about the film - he looks for the best way to shoot his story. Invictus never comes off as pretentious under Eastwood's direction. It doesn't try to shove anything in your face. Eastwood tells us a fantastic, inspiring, story and he simple asks us to go in with an open mind.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as South African president Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as François Pienaar, the captain of South Africa's rugby team the Springboks, are magnetic on the screen. Freeman is terrific as Mandela playing the role with charm and charisma. Matt Damon has done the performance of his career. His role doesn't get enough time to develop as much as Mandela but what he does, he does amazingly well.<br/><br/>Invictus is a film with some incredible heart and emotion and it was one of the best films of 2009 by far."

He believes in working hard to unite all the people and forgiving those who have harmed him and his people.

"tburke85","9","2","4","20 June 2010"," Invictus An Excellent Drama Based On A True Story
","Invictus is an excellent drama based on a true story with great performances by the two lead actors who really bring their A game to this movie. Director Clint Eastwood continues to show audiences and critics that he's one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood with this one. Morgan Freeman is superb as always as Nelson Mandela who after being released from prison soon goes on to become the President of South Africa. Believing he can bring his divided people together through the universal language of sport, Mandela enlists the help of South African rugby Captain Francois Pienaar to make a run for 1995 World Cup Championship Match. Freeman is so convincing as the newly elected president Mandela. He turns in another great performance among many proving his talent as a veteran actor. Matt Damon is equally impressive as Pienaar the rugby Captain who rallies his teammates to achieve what seems impossible. Damon may not be as tall as the real Pienaar but like Freeman he becomes the character and turns in a solid performance none the less. Damon and Freeman played off each other very well in their scenes together making the growing friendship between their characters believable. The rest of the relatively unknown cast are also very good as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. I can't think of too much I didn't enjoy about this film because Invictus was much better than expected. I mean I heard it was supposed to be good but Invictus still impressed me with how well Eastwood put it together which like many other films I'm sure wasn't easy. The pacing is fine except the 134 minute running time did seem a little slow at times and the satisfying ending I sort of suspected but those are two tiny flaws because the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. The real locations they used added a lot to the film making you feel for the characters and their situation. The movie in the beginning had a documentary type feel as well which worked in it's favor. So overall if you're looking for inspiring drama based on a true story, Invictus is the movie for you. I plan to see this again sometime because I believe it's worth seeing more than once. It's a film about how the power of hope and forgiveness can unite country. Invictus has a similar compelling story, drama, a little humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon) who make this movie worth the time to watch."

","Based upon a true story.<br/><br/>After almost 30 years of imprisonment, Nelson Mandela (Freeman) becomes President of South Africa and makes it his mission to forgive his suppressors and to unite the country, both black and white, through the sport of Rugby. <br/><br/>Rugby. Almost like American football except there don't appear to be many rules, no pads, no helmets, no instant replay, no forward pass and no cheerleaders. Bummer.<br/><br/>Invictus is a poem by William Ernest Henley and the last two lines sum up everything: I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul. Mandela used the poem to not give in or give up to anything while he was in prison regardless of the hardships he endured there. <br/><br/>This is a class act on a grand scale and may be Clint Eastwood's most important film. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon deserved the Oscar nominations as they and the entire cast were outstanding. <br/><br/>Maybe the concentration on Rugby was too much and nothing was mentioned about the other duties of the new South African government, but President Mandela needed to unify the country before he could feel confident the whole country was behind him on other matters. It worked. He and the South Africans win. Wouldn't it be nice if nations could use sports to vent whatever they feel they need to vent. And, if they lose, well, there's always next year.<br/><br/>We didn't get any insight into Mandela's daughter who couldn't get over the white South Africans as also part of the new government. She kept remembering that they were the ones who threw the Mandela family out of their house. After the Rugby match, did she see the wisdom of what President Mandela accomplished with Rugby? This was not addressed. <br/><br/>Nevermind playing Rugby, watching parts of a Rugby game in a movie isn't easy either, you know. I did some damage to my knee and right elbow watching some of the hits. I could become a Rugby fan if they had more rules, pads, helmets, instant replay, the forward pass and, of course, cheerleaders (but, Bob, that's American Football). Exactly. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes, Rugby is a violent game. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Believe I only heard one F-bomb"

","Allow me to lead you, says Morgan Freeman quietly but authoritatively to his band of party men who are voting for scrapping the Springbok label for South African Rugby team. It is a powerful and defining moment of the film. After taking over as the President of South Africa in 1994, Nelson Mandela sees a huge opportunity to project his country as a multiracial democracy to the world during the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The film, based on John Carlin's book 'Playing the Enemy', is a very poignant delineation of how he goes about this task. Much to the chagrin of his close aides, he invests not an inconsiderable amount of time to befriend the Rugby team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon). In a very memorable sequence of the film, the President invites the Captain to his office for tea and the two exchange notes on leadership. Invictus offers totally credible lessons on leadership, without even a wee bit of pontification. Winning the World Cup becomes a metaphor for uniting a fractured nation.<br/><br/>Invictus (Latin for invincible) is a short poem by William Ernest Henley that Nelson Mandela had with him when he was incarcerated for 27 years. He hands over this inspiring poem to Francois before the start of the World Cup.<br/><br/>The game sequences, and there are plenty of them, are shot and edited with the right amount of tension and clutch your eyeballs completely.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Nelson Mandela with great dignity and compassion. Matt Damon as the overawed captain is excellent. Director Clint Eastwood has extracted powerful, yet unobtrusive performances.<br/><br/>Invictus is a little gem of a film. It is hard to stay unaffected during its two odd hours. You are not human if you are unmoved. If I had my way I would make Invictus mandatory viewing for all the politicians of the world."

","This is a movie about reconciliation and leadership. In South Africa of the apartheid era, unbelievable outrageousness and tyranny against black people was the national policy. Nelson Mandela was a leader of the guerrilla against the government, who was arrested in 1962. Mandela was released in 1990 by then president de Klerk. The movie starts from that day. White people feel fearful about the release. The fear had reason. Most countries where black took over white ruling in the past, white got South Africa revenged and their land and properties were striped down, and those uneducated black people could not run the country. Mandela, however, adopted reconciliation as the principle to run the country, and he got the idea to make the rugby World Cup Game as the chance for the national reconciliation. An outstanding leader ponders and considers deeply how to achieve the final goal of the organization, and once he decides to do something, he works unflinchingly without hesitation. The movie clearly portrays how Mandela, acted by Morgan Freeman, appealed the people for reconciliation and forgiveness, and made the people around him, particularly the team captain, work for it. Freeman perfectly acted this actually existing person. I recommend this to everyone around me."

A good story, straight up with no frills in direction or extravagant special effects, and actors giving it all they've got either because Eastwood tells them how to or because they know they're working with a legend. Man, I hope he doesn't retire. <br/><br/>I can't believe I teared up in a movie about rugby! Okay it's not all about rugby but still!<br/><br/>The movie's about Nelson Mandela and the significance of the rugby world cup in that first term of his presidential tenure. I've heard of the man but honestly, before this movie I couldn't even tell you who he was and what he did. Eastwood provided sufficient background to the story of Mandela and South Africa without dragging the movie down with too much history, and he kept a good pace so that I wasn't never bored. <br/><br/>I can't say I know more about rugby now, but with a sports movie, you don't need to know the sport to feel the emotions that a good movie captures from the athletes and spectators (hence my tearing up at the big finale). <br/><br/>Having never seen Mandela on TV, I can't say if Morgan Freeman did a good imitation, but no matter - he's a consummate actor who embodied the character. I wonder if Matt Damon got nominated because this is his least showy role ever. It's pretty cool how he almost disappeared into the performance but I don't think that the role is substantial enough to warrant an Oscar win."

","Diane and I were both moved by all that we saw during Invictus. I congratulate Eastwood for attempting, what to me, was an unlikely story in that rugby is a sport that few Americans know anything about although it is hugely important here in Australia as well as in New Zealand just across the Tasman. To select a film about a man who is truly the savior of his country and then form the story around an international game was a tremendous gamble but because of Eastwood's command of the film art form, the movie was an amazing visual, emotional and intellectual package. The story of Nelson Mandela is in and of itself easily one of the greatest stories of humanity in and then to wrap that story around something as unlikely as South Africa's participation in a World Cup rugby game speaks volumes about the director's competence as well as that of the script writer, the actors and the original novel from which the story was taken. Very early in the film you are struck by Mandela's political genius; we in the modern world are unused to seeing a person so sensitive to the needs of his country that he can rise above his own needs. We are unused to a person that is so sensitive to the greater movements around him that he can act for that greater need. When you remember that Mandela spent 16 years of his life in prison making little rocks out of big rocks then the enormity of this man's genius is almost beyond comprehension. When he sees what needs to be done and then goes through the motions of trying to make people who can only, because their mind is not equal to his, see their private histories rather than his embracing human view then one is involved in the tension of all that has been reduced to one game of rugby. This movie is transcending and must be watched."

","At age 80, with 30 films under his belt as a director and scores more as an actor, Clint Eastwood isn't slowing down. He makes almost a film a year, and in recent years, those films are more often than not front-runners come Oscar time. It's not hard to see why he maintains the pace that he does: his films belie not only his talent, but his love of the craft of film-making. When he makes a film that he doesn't star in, as with this year's Invictus or last year's The Changeling, what's surprising is how transparent his hand is. For a man with such an enormously weighty cultural history, for a man whose artistic strides are all over the last half of the last century, his films often contain no ""Clint-ness"". There are few nods to previous films. Each film is made according to the needs of its story. Once the film starts, there's no trading on past achievements. Eastwood rarely revisits the same ground, the way a Scorcese or a Spielberg will, seeming to prefer instead just the work itself. And why not? He gets to tell great stories, working with great people. Why would he stop? Invictus is set in the time leading up to the 1995 World Cup of Rugby in South Africa. The Springboks, the South African national side, are allowed to compete for the first time, having been banned during the Apartheid years, but are far from a favourite. They're not given much of a chance internationally, and they're not loved at home, as the newly-free black population sees them as green-and-gold symbols of Afrikaaner domination. Sensing the unifying potential of a victory on their own home turf, president Mandela (Morgan Freeman) invites captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to tea, and politely asks him to win the World Cup.<br/><br/>What a story to tell – a true tale that would be dismissed as clichéd and obvious, were it a fiction – and what a responsibility for those telling it. Invictus is a rather ordinary film about an extraordinary true event, world history transformed or distilled into a standard sports-redeems-a-man-and-a-community story. The performances are average, for the actors playing them. Damon isn't given much to work with: he is asked to win, and he does, he is asked to hang out with Mandela, an icon, and does. Freeman's Mandela is exactly our conception of him: the kindly, almost doddering father of a people. While there are some few peeks at the more politically calculating side of him, which are interesting, he eventually is swept up, as is everyone in the moment, in the sheer joy of sporting victory. Both are solid, both are about what you would expect.<br/><br/>But what joy the victory brought to the people of South Africa! This joy is communicated to us is through 10 or 12 sweeping shots of jam-packed stadiums, full of people waving flags, jumping, leaping and shouting, done in just the most appalling CGI I have seen in years. It wouldn't be worth mentioning, normally, these few bad shots, but they're so bad that they're jarring. This is also the case with some other choices, including some of the horrendously on-the-nose songs in the score, and the inclusion of some paper-thin back-patty subplots about how Mandela's security Learn to Overcome Their Differences Because of Sports. There's a handful of nettlesome bad choices in the film, enough that they drag it down a bit, and take the joyous edge off of what's otherwise a fine if bog-standard semi-inspirational kind of eye-rolly sports movie. 6/10."

","I invite everyone to witness the inspiring human factors of the brilliant film ""Invictus"". The narrative is based on real life events in South Africa during the mid 90's. During that time, newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela tried to pull the rug out of the carpet by taking a keen interest in the country's mostly-white Rugby team in hopes of uniting a post-apartheid South Africa; and that is as clear as black & white during the movie. Mandela unites with the team's captain Francois Pienaar to fulfill this, and their scenes together is the apex of the film's supremacy. To this day, Nelson is one cool rocking fellow! Morgan Freeman's superb performance as Mandela was not an imitation but a personification of one of history's most respected leaders. Freeman plays the recently freeman Mandela of the 90's with precise authenticity. Matt Damon was captivating as Pienaar, and his Mandela-inspired capitan character scored high points thanks to Mr. D's brilliant work. But the ultimate human factor of ""Invictus"" was the exceptional direction of the legendary Clint Eastwood; it never ceases to amaze me how he continues to be so good, so baaadass, but never ugly in his career's twilight time. The Richness of Eastwood strikes again. Anthony Peckham's screenplay was infiltrated with typical sports & humane clichés, but it did not peck away from the film's central goodwill focus. I will also not evict Tom Stern's cinematography and Tom Hannam's art direction from the ""Invictus"" cinematic goodwill house anytime soon; I was dazzled by their meticulous efforts on the film's look. So unite and free yourself from the oppressions of boredom and visit ""Invictus"" today! ***** Excellent"

Truth is – this is a story on how less important things (as few sport games) can influent entire life in one country. <br/><br/>When Eastwood searched for Mandela he surely could not have hard job – Morgan Freemen is probably one of only few that could be ""wise old leader"". Excellent performance!"

","Easily one of the best movies of the year, it has been mentioned that this movie has no story line behind it and that Eastwood is taking a preacher attitude thru it. Well in a sense this is the point behind it. It a hopeful movie it shows how the rooted hate and racism of a hole nation can be canceled by a common goal. the deep wounds of a country which had years of oppression and hate can not be fixed without forgiveness. What would be of human kind if on a change of power hate continues the other way around (Hotel Ruwanda comes into mind)Now reviewing the movie the acting is good however the highlight for me is the story line behind it that can move a country. A simple game can not fix a country yet years of suffering can not be changed by one man the healing can only be started by him"

","Morgan Freeman's poignant and gentle portrayal of Nelson Madela will surely earn him at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, if not the Academy Award itself. Having spent most of his career being typecast as, you know, that black detective in all those mystery thrillers, or perhaps the president in a disaster movie, Morgan Freeman finally proves that he can act, and then some, with his rare performance in Invictus. Matt Damon, well, he is right for the part but he might as well be an extra in this Morgan Freeman film. I didn't find out until the closing credits that Invictus is directed by Clint Eastwood. Clint is a brilliant director, no doubt about it. The last half hour or so turns into a sports movie cliché but this is so easily forgiven after receiving the enjoyment of Morgan Freeman's performance. You will laugh; you will cry. Most of all, you will cheer."
"rudy-altergott","10","2","4","19 December 2009"," A Long Awaited Gem
","I had first heard of the prospect of Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela in around 2005, I think it was. Its title then was The Human Element. Even at the time, I thought it was a perfect choice. It was not until later that I understood it would be directed by my hero Clint Eastwood and not just be about the Madiba's journey from extremist to world leader, but about his role in uniting his country with the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. Being a fan of sports films, especially historical ones with profound messages (my name is Rudy, after all), I was excited with the prospect.<br/><br/>I finally saw Invictus last night. I was brought to tears at some parts of the film, not of sorrow, but joy for what the World Cup had allowed to happen. Following years of brutal tyranny under apartheid, Madiba (a tribal honorific that people call Mandela), a former belligerent, turned the other cheek. Imprisoned for nearly three decades in a small room and forced to work in a lime quarry, we learn how he overcame this hardship, reading William Henley's poem Invictus and studying the ways of his Afrikaner jailers. When released, he campaigned actively for unity and eventually was elected President of South Africa by his peers in the black majority. Not long into his administration, he attends a Springbok Rugby match and sees the division between his people. The Afrikaners are for the Springboks, but the Africans are for the English team. He then sets out to do what he can to garner support for the Springboks, pushing against the current of his own people who see the team as part of the apartheid era. With his commanding voice and uncanny appearance, one would think Freeman truly was Madiba, himself. <br/><br/>Matt Damon serves as the other protagonist, Springbok captain Francois Pienaar. An inspiring leader like Madiba, he at first just wants the Springboks to win just one bloody game. He's the son of a racist Afrikaner father, though he himself never seems to be in that circle. When he gets to know Mandela better, Pienaar himself changes. He enforces PR opportunities for the World Cup and helps coordinate a team trip to the closed prison of Robben Island, where Mandela was held for most of his twenty-seven year term. Inspired by his new president, Pienaar is able to rally the troops and make it all the way to the Cup. The problem is that their opponent, New Zealand, is a powerhouse. You are kept on the edge of your seat the entire match.<br/><br/>I hope not to ruin the film for anyone, though I have warned for some spoilers. I've tried to keep this review short as to avoid that and make you see the movie to get the full scoop. However, if you are reading this, I highly implore to see the film. This is the best film of 2009 in my mind, so far. I should hope that it would receive Oscars, plural. Its hard to remember that Clint directed it, but then again the beautiful music of his son Kyle and his amazing taste for projects and for actors and scenes make him one of my favorites. In the absence of unity, a nation can tear itself apart. Eastwood shows us that one man can start the long road to peace, and Morgan Freeman, as always, shows us just how that can be done."

","Greetings again from the darkness. I have said many times over the past few years that Clint Eastwood is the classiest filmmaker working today. We can always count on his films to be technically well made, interesting and entertaining. Invictus is no exception. What it's not is a classic film, or even one of Clint's best. Nonetheless, it is worth seeing from a historical standpoint as well as for Morgan Freeman's fine performance.<br/><br/>The dialogue is sprinkled with many of Nelson Mandela's own words and the story is based on the book by John Carlin. Without a doubt, the best parts of the film are those showing Mr. Freeman portraying Mr. Mandela ""behind the scenes"" ... whether in his office or spouting his amazing philosophy to his security crew. Whatever your politics, Mr. Mandela was a fascinating man who survived an excruciating ordeal (for almost 30 years). For his mind, body and spirit to survive is reason enough to learn more about him as a man (warts and all).<br/><br/>The weakest part of the movie is the enormous amount of rugby time we are forced to watch. Most of the scenes/plays are staged and filmed in tight shots so as not to expose the weakness of the game or actors. Unfortunately, this makes up a huge portion of this overly long film. Obviously the rugby story line is historical and a story worth telling, but the film would have been more impactful with more Mandella musings and less fake Matt Damon rugby.<br/><br/>As always, Clint's film score is perfect. The only shocking moment was the terrible song playing as Mandela's helicopter lands on the practice field. It was an inexcusable MTV moment from a master. Otherwise, a film to see, though not necessarily one to adore."
"MatthewLong23","9","2","4","13 December 2009"," Awesome movie
","This is an awesome movie to watch. It tells the story of the rise of Nelson Mandela in South Africa to becoming president of the country. He uses the South African Rugby team as a way to bring the country together, as many people view it as a reminder of the apartheid before Mandela came to be in power. Morgan Freeman will probably get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal in this film as he does a great job. The film focuses mainly on the team and it's captain played by Matt Damon. It is mainly a story about the underdog as the team stinks until Damon gets asked by the president to win the World Cup of Rugby. The story does not focus on Mandela as a person and how he came to be the way he is. Little was done with his time in prison as it is only reflected on when the team visits the jail cell he once lived in. But that doesn't matter to much as the film works as there is a lot of scenes of the team overcoming obstacles and coming together for their country. I highly recommend this film. This is probably Clint Eastwood's lightest fair in a while as it can be described as a feel good kind of movie."

This is an inspirational story about a rugby team that refuses to give in, and succeeds despite all odds at mending its broken country. Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, is the epitome of leading by example. He is an empathetic, but strong willed leader who is determined to see his country whole again.He forgives those who locked him away in a cell and subjected him to hard labor for 30 years, because he wanted freedom for his people. He realizes now that his past enemies are now his people, and he must guide them. He keeps the name of the Springboks, and interests himself in the sport of his country. He talks to crowds of people, any of whom might be an assailant, but he puts himself in danger to show that he is not afraid, that these are his people. He supports the culture of the white minority, even though they were his enemies. He also leads Francois, captain of the South African Rugby team, by giving him a poem for which the film is named. Francois is a sincere leader who wants the best for his team, and he tries to accomplish the goals that he and Mandela share, a victory for South Africa. Matt Damon plays this part extremely well, nervous when first meeting Mandela, serious when leading his team off the field, and fierce in the huddle. The poem that helped both Mandela and Francois preaches perseverance and strength under pressure. For while an enemy may beat you, he may not crush your soul unless you let him. This is a theme shown throughout the film that makes this story so inspirational."

The film tells the true story of Mandela's presidency as he struggles to overcome prejudice and years of hatred and violence between blacks and whites. Seeing in the nation's rugby team an opportunity to unite his people, he befriends the team's captain (Damon).<br/><br/>While loaded with true-life sports movie clichés, Invictus overcomes them through the strength of its acting and the attention to political detail, from the desire of blacks to take back their country to the fears of whites about losing their voice in the newly democratic nation.

This movie features some great performances by both Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman, they are definitely the highlight of the movie. I think this movie highlights an essential part of the Apartheid conflict, and the struggle to return to normality after freeing Mandela. I also really enjoyed the music in this movie, I felt it appropriately added to the tone where necessary. I felt that Clint Eastwood's direction wasn't anything to run home about, it helps to develop the story where necessary but mostly goes unnoticed.

","Appropriately, this dramatisation of South Africa's famous Rugby World Cup victory in 1995 in their own country, just a few years after Nelson Mandela's release from prison and the nation's re-admission to international sport, was shown while the present competition is occurring (Come on Scotland!). Actually I'm no rugby buff and so without a full working knowledge of the events of the time, bar the conclusion of course, let myself be swept along in a green and gold wave of sporting triumph and nation-building under the aegis of Mandela's benevolent presidency.<br/><br/>The three narrative viewpoints centre on Mandela himself naturally and his transformation of the hard-line body politic in South Africa, the national rugby team captain Francois Pienaar and his evolution from relatively ignorant white Afrikaner to an inspiring one-nation sports idol, inspired by the humanity of Mandela and as a counterpoint microcosm of the new South Africa, the fractious, grudging melding of the established white security detail with Mandela's new black team which naturally goes from mutual dislike and mistrust to eventual respect and cooperation if not outright affection. <br/><br/>In truth there wasn't too much drama to get excited about, as there usually isn't in sporting dramas and I have to say that while I enjoyed the triumph of the underdog and the respected the magnanimity of Mandela's conciliatory vision for his nation, director Eastwood didn't exactly rouse me out of my seat in so doing. I also never quite believed that I was watching Nelson Mandela, as Morgan Freeman, game as he is, just always looked like Morgan Freeman in the film. Damon benefits from being based on a less widely-known character although I understand that physically he resembles Pienaar just about as little as Freeman does Mandela. As ever he engages totally with his role, especially physically so that you believe in his part.<br/><br/>The crowd scenes, especially recreating the stadium-full atmosphere of the Final and the later euphoric street celebrations of black and white alike are well done, even if you don't quite get the full blood and guts effect of fully engaged sport in the matches itself. Eastwood also, as ever, takes plenty of time out for reflective silence and rumination with some obvious exposition inserts too, no doubt with the American viewer in mind (say, how does this extra-time work again?).<br/><br/>Still, it had to be said he does a relatively good job with an assignment which must have been somewhat alien to him and pays proper respect to one of the more notable sporting and national triumphs of recent times."

","Sports films usually leave me cold; I never watch sport in real life so watching it in film holds no appeal for me. However, this story of rugby in South Africa in the early 1990s holds plenty of appeal, thanks to expert direction from Clint Eastwood and an excellent performance from Morgan Freeman who embodies the spirit and persona of Nelson Mandela. It's the political backdrop that makes the sport interesting, and INVICTUS is a great film to watch as a result.<br/><br/>The cinematography is particularly proficient here; I had the pleasure of watching this in high definition and it's a beautiful film to look at. Eastwood is on top form. The material is a little weaker, failing to explore the complexities of the situation and sinking into schmaltz at various points; Eastwood can't avoid evoking some sentimentality in scenes of stirring music playing and whites and blacks working together. It's not as bad as in something like VOLCANO, but it's there, and it's a bit condescending. Still, Matt Damon's on board and delivers another solid turn, and even the hardest of hearts will find much to enjoy here."

","I once was lying on a beach in South Africa and noticed a bunch of white school kids jumping off the school bus and heading towards the waves but they were not there to swim or surf. They had a rugby ball with them and in effect running with the ball while others tried to tackle them. It was a beautiful sight.<br/><br/>It just shows how popular and important rugby is to the whites in South Africa. To the blacks, soccer is more important. To them rugby was the game of the oppressor, hence why they would support the opposing team.<br/><br/>Invictus mashes up the early months of Nelson Mandela's Presidency of post apartheid South Africa and the Springboks preparation of the Rugby World Cup to be held in South Africa in 1995.<br/><br/>The ending of apartheid meant that South Africa were allowed to compete in international competitions and the hosting of the rugby World Cup was swift reward.<br/><br/>The film therefore has two threads. Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) treading carefully in a country where the white minority are fearful of the future as shown by the distrust with his own security personnel which now includes the black ANC members and the white security team of the former president.<br/><br/>At the same time you have the national rugby team lead by captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) whose team is almost all white, which has little support from the black majority who want the team renamed and worse they are on a losing streak, criticised by former players and pundits. Its a team lacking in confidence and support.<br/><br/>Invictus is a film of how the country and President gets behind the team and how the team responds. Its a true story which resulted in a South African victory against the All Blacks who had the fearsome man mountain, Jonah Lomu. The abiding image of the final was Nelson Mandela appearing in the final to greet the team wearing the green and gold of the Springboks.<br/><br/>The film is directed by two times best director Oscar winner, Clint Eastwood. A criticism of Eastwood is that he is the epitome of an efficient director lacking a signature style. Invictus is a good example of this. If you missed the starting titles, you would actually think that its made by a solid British director than an American legend.<br/><br/>It is a dependable film with some substance. How can you not fail with such a true story? You have the inspiring Mandela played by Freeman with a twinkle in his eye. Damon is more earnest as Pienaar realising that he needs to lead more than just a sub-par team to the Rugby World Cup but needs to reunite decades of racial divisions in the new South Africa.<br/><br/>However the film never goes above such platitudes. I imagined this film in the hands of a younger Richard Attenborough who would never had stooped to use CGI to fill the stadiums. He would had got 60,000 extras and made the film soar and given it a harder edge and I do not mean just in the rugby scenes which seemed a little off to me lacking the blood and guts of the actual game.

"imagiking","7","0","0","29 April 2011"," Invictus: Some Compelling Drama
","Despite my ferocious adoration of the films of Clint Eastwood, particularly the more recent ones with accomplished cinematographer Tom Stern, Invictus was a film I had avoided seeing, simply due to my complete disinterest in sport and inability to watch it. Finally, however, I was forced to put my dislike aside to get my Clint fix.<br/><br/>Reliving the story of Nelson Mandela's early presidency, Invictus follows the newly elected leader's plan to unite his post-apartheid nation through the country's rugby team, a former symbol of the white oppressors. Collaborating with captain Francois Pienaar to establish the Springboks team as an institution which can be supported by all colours, Mandela sees World Cup victory as a much needed catalyst to healing the wounds of racial segregation.<br/><br/>It is precisely in the above plot summary that one can find what turned me from getting to this film for so very long a time, the unifying power of rugby not something I exactly believed in whatsoever. That said, any collaboration between Eastwood and Stern is automatically compulsory viewing material for me, so huge a fan am I of the sum of their creative visions. And yet, I couldn't help but maintain a scepticism nevertheless. Opening with newsreels covering Mandela's release from prison and election to office mixed with shots of Freeman altered to look like the newsreel footage, Invictus does not dwell on the politics surrounding the election, preferring to begin instead with the new president's first day in office. We immediately see, as perhaps we ought to expect, the theme of race relations coming to the forefront of the film's focus. The presidential guard serves as the primary representation of the changing state of South Africa, the two colours begrudgingly forced to work together and eventually coming to trust, even like, one another. As Mandela comes to have his bodyguards overcome their prejudices and forgive those who did them wrong, so too does he slowly repair his country's damaged state, caused as it is by the distrust of decades of enforced segregation. The first thing to address must surely be the performances. As Mandela's personal choice, Freeman does a very fine job. Not usually much a fan of his roles, I was behind him the whole way. Damon too is on good form, better than I've known him to be in the past (his wonderful performance in Hereafter suggests that he works well with Eastwood). Fortunately for me, the scenes of rugby are minimal, far more time spent off the pitch than on. Now, as someone who really just doesn't get sport at all, I of course had no familiarity with this story, and no idea whether or not the Springboks would emerge triumphant. The fact that I was rather interested to find out says something about the film's tension, though I would be lying if I said I was shouting for them. What is impressive is that through the sweeping crane shots of thousands of faces cheering on their team and the images of black and white united together in mutual hope, I came to understand— if only slightly—why sport can mean so much to so many. And do believe me when I say that that really does say an awful lot.<br/><br/>Though it falls far short of his best work, Invictus is a strong offer from Eastwood. As someone completely ignorant of its subject matter, the fact that I was made to be interested in the match, and even brought to understand the meaning of sport for people, does much to contribute to my appreciation of the film. It may not be a masterpiece, but it makes for some compelling drama."

However when I finally watched it last night I was more than glad I did. <br/><br/>Based on true events which occurred surrounding the newly elected south African president Nelson Mandela and the de motivated and beaten up Rugby team which has no direction 'Invictus' is a story or triumph, humanity and most of all politics which is intended to change the world for the better. Mandela not being the popular elect amongst the whites strategically place Ruby as a tool of attention and somewhat bait to unite the whole country in to one purpose ; Gear up and change the country. The movie no doubt portray how well Mandela is in his office and uses his humanitarian attitude surprisingly well towards other who might think that he will resist. More than Rugby once you concentrate on the Mandela character the movie itself will start to be an inspiration towards any human being who breathes. <br/><br/>Wonderfully crafted cast including Morgan Freemon as Mandela and Matt Damon as the Rugby teams captain Francois Pienaar, 'Invictus' has made way in to my sports movies hall of fame. Proving once again that Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest of directors of our time surpassing who he was being an actor of my time this movie is a winner by all means. I will cherish it just like I did Coach Carter, Radio and Blind Side. <br/><br/>Just before I wind up, 'Invictus' in real is a short poem by English poet William Ernest Henley (1849-1903). It was written in 1875 and first published in 1888 in Henley's Book of Verses. It says that Mandela was inspired by this poem while he was in prison and no doubt that you may too so I shall keep it in this post.

To my understanding, the story is not exactly historically accurate, but fortunately not because Clint Eastwood felt the need to artificially generate personal conflict and tension, a moving back story just so we can worry, if Johnnys foot will heal in time before the big game. Instead he lets the central message dominate above the little problems of separate characters, pretty irrelevant they would be compared to a whole country in fear.<br/><br/>So just let the positive vibes in.

","Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" tells the true story of Nelson Mandela's involvement with the South African rugby team as they prepared for and participated in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. This was the first major sporting event to take place in South Africa following the end of apartheid and Mandela saw it as an opportunity to promote unity through sport.<br/><br/>The film is buoyed by a pair of standout performances. Morgan Freeman (as Nelson Mandela) and Matt Damon (as captain of the South African rugby team) both landed well-deserved Oscar nominations for their performances. I was particularly impressed with Freeman's performance, wherein he convincingly evoked the spirit and mannerisms of Nelson Mandela. As is typical of Eastwood's recent films, the supporting cast is full of unfamiliar faces but solid nonetheless.<br/><br/>The script is well done with an effective balance between Mandela's objectives and the goals of the national rugby team. As usual, Eastwood's direction is well-handled and the film has a polished look. The music is mostly good too but I have to admit that the few vocal pieces seemed pretty hokey to me.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Invictus"" is a worthwhile sports film with some added dramatic impact due to the South African setting and the presence of Nelson Mandela. I should also note that the film sticks pretty close to the truth, which, in the end, makes it even more remarkable."

","This film is about the birth of unity within the new South Africa after the minority white government had been voted out and the nations' first black President took the oath of office. Everyone had to learn to work together, and they were having difficulty doing so. There was a predominantly white rugby team that had a dismal record, but was still followed passionately mostly by the white people in the country. The new President, Nelson Mandela, took the opportunity to get the team to play for the entire country instead of just for the white minority. Along the way, national pride swelled as the nations' black majority, who hadn't cared about rugby before, began to back the team. Look for some good acting, but, I must say that the performance I liked the least was Morgan Freemans as Nelson Mandela. They had him affecting a sort of accent and I believe it hurt his performance. He is usually by far the best actor in any film. But other than the fake accent, this is a very good film, directed well by Clint Eastwood."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 1990, after nearly thirty years incarceration, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is released and becomes ruler of South Africa, signalling an end of the apartheid era and a new, more democratic nation setting in. However, there is social unease, as the national sport, rugby, is still under the moniker of the Springboks, a symbol of the pro apartheid era. However, Mandela hopes his nation to embrace a new notion of forgiveness, hopefully learning from his example towards his captors. After a series of meetings with celebrated Springboks captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) he sets a chain of events in motion that sees the team on course to victory at the 1995 Rugby Championships.<br/><br/>At a time in his life and career where he prefers to be behind the camera rather than in front of it, Clint Eastwood is always very surprising in the choice of tale he brings to the big screen. Here is yet another surprising but effective story, brought to life with the professional standards you can always expect from Eastwood.<br/><br/>In the lead role, Freeman, always an actor Eastwood gets the best from, plays Mandela in his sleep, but is blessed to capture his accent and mannerisms just fine, too. Likewise, Damon is well suited to the role of Springboks captain Pienaar, with the physical presence and stature to convince, but also evokes emotion by delivering a moving portrait of a man startled by another's ability to forgive and overcome. As the two lead stars of the film, they have even better chemistry than you might originally have thought.<br/><br/>Director, stars and pretty much everyone involved have come together and delivered something fine. ****"

","It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. <br/><br/>These words, this verse of the poem by William Ernest Hensley in 1875, was the mantra of Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment in South Africa. He refused to give in to hate. He refused to give in to revenge. But how do you pull along an entire country with you? Especially a country as racially divisive as South Africa where Apartheid was a part of the landscape and politics for nearly 50 years?<br/><br/>Risking everything, Mandela achieved greatness by focusing not on politics, but on a sport: Rugby. Wanting to win the World Cup and thus unite a country, Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freman, WANTED) sets out not to divide and conquer, but to unite and calm the racial tensions raging through his beloved South Africa. <br/><br/>With him, Mandela must convince Rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon, THE DEPARTED) that their poorly performing team can do the impossible: win the World Cup.<br/><br/>As most of us now know, that is precisely what happens, and South Africa, for a while, forgets her bloody black-and-white past and turns everyone flush with excitement for simply being South African. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has proved in his waning years that he should remain (mostly) behind the camera and not in front of it. With the exception of GRAN TORINO, I've not been much of a fan of his as of late. However, when it comes to his directing chops, I've been fairly well pleased. Probably my favorite acted/directed Clint film would be the lesser known HEARTBREAK RIDGE. But that might just be me. <br/><br/>Many have already said that this was ""the role Morgan Freeman was meant to play,"" and I won't contradict that. He was completely believable as Mandela, getting the look, verbal cadence and movements of The Great Man down perfectly. <br/><br/>Matt Damon on the other hand ...didn't really strike me as the bullish and larger-than-life Francois. Although I think he did ""okay."" I believe that a search for a more stylized actor could've easily resulted in a match more adequate to the part. <br/><br/>Regardless, the filming is enthralling because of Freeman's performance and the fact-based situations that this movie is based upon. For those looking for a sports film in-line with HOOSIERS, ROCKY or RUDY, you might want to look elsewhere. For those with an interest in human history and how politics can sometimes take a dive toward the goal line, this one will run straight at you."

","Nelson Mandela is one of the very few people I can think of (and certainly the only one living today) to whom I would be willing to apply the adjective ""great."" His personal story of rising from imprisonment under apartheid to becoming the first black President of South Africa is a powerful testimony to perseverance and forgiveness, as instead of using his newly acquired power to take revenge on those who had oppressed he and his people, he chose to use his power to promote reconciliation. The world would be so much better off today if there were more Mandelas! ""Invictus"" offers just a small part of that story. Shortly after the advent of majority rule, South Africa hosted the World Cup of rugby. South Africa's own rugby team was (with one exception) all white, and had been hated by the black majority during the apartheid era. Mandela chose to use the team as a way to promote unity in the country. The disunity was shown in many ways - Mandela's own presidential bodyguards (some black and some white) were highly suspicious of each other, and in a match against England before the tournament the black spectators cheered for England. By publicly supporting the team, Mandela brought other blacks onside as well, and brought blacks and whites together as they all rallied around the team. It was really very moving to watch the barriers come crashing down in so many ways.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was very good as Mandela - as good as anyone could have played the difficult part of a man who is truly a living legend. Matt Damon was excellent as the captain of the Springboks (the name of the South African team.) His family were suspicious of Mandela, and yet once he actually met Mandela, he quickly bought into the desire to unify the country around the symbol of the team. Damon seemed to capture the essence of the character well.<br/><br/>I'm not a rugby fan, so the actual scenes of the matches meant little to me (although they were very well shot, and did offer an sort of ""you are there"" type of experience.) There was some beautiful scenery shot in the course of the movie and you do feel moved as - so to speak - the walls come tumbling down."

","The title of the movie is ""Invictus"" and it only become clear somewhere in the middle that it is a reference to a 4-stanza poem from the 19th century, and its last stanza is:<br/><br/>It matters not how strait the gait, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/>That was written by a young man who had to have his foot amputated, and Nelson Mandella favored it and used it for inspiration and hope while he was imprisoned. <br/><br/>The movie covers roughly 1991 when Mandela was released from prison through the 1995 Wold Cup Rugby matches hosted by South Africa. <br/><br/>When Mandela won the election the country was fragmented, with a strong black vs white mentality. Even though Mandela was one of those persecuted, now as president he knew his biggest challenge was to unite the country. <br/><br/>This movie uses Rugby as the vehicle for this unification effort. With only one black on the national; rugby team, the sport was considered mostly a white man sport. But Mandela threw his support, even learning the names of each player, and addressing them personally when he visited them. He especially befriended the captain, and shared with him the ""Invictus"" poem as a way to deal with life.<br/><br/>The South African Rugby team was mediocre at best, but they wanted to make a good showing as host for the World Cup. So much of the movie deals with Mandela's developing government along side the Rugby Team's development as a challenge on the world stage of rugby.<br/><br/>This is a Clint Eastwood film. Morgan Freeman is perfect as Nelson Mandela. And Matt Damon is perfect as François Pienaar, the captain of the rugby team. Damon even wears a nose prosthetic that results in his looking very much like the real player.<br/><br/>I give this movie my highest rating, it is a lesson in how good leadership can turn around a country and a sports program."

","Invictus Morgan Freeman Matt Damon Nursing a hangover in a flat somewhere in Upton Park, East London that's where I was. Not when I watched Invictus, when Mandela was released I mean. Isn't it supposed to be one of those 'where were you when' moments? Well I'd crashed the night in Upton Park after a party and everyone sat around watching it on TV.<br/><br/>Invictus is about those early years of the new South Africa after Mandela became president. A new nation, a new democracy, a new anthem and a new hope. The film chooses to focus on one aspect of those moments, South Africa's rugby team the Springboks. For those who don't know rugby, due to the aparthied system the Springboks were alienated for decades unable to play in international tournaments. By the time Mandela was president of the new RSA, they were awarded the hosting of the 1995 Rugby World Cup as a reward. Rugby at that time was considered a whiteman's sport in South Africa, not taken to by the black population who preferred soccer, and rugby was a symbol of the apartied oppression. Director Clint Eastwood focuses on how against all odds Mandela helped the Springboks not only manage greatness on the rugby field but using the world cup and the rejuvenating national pride to became a truly national team and a unifying force.<br/><br/>The story is well told in a good chronological and factual order, nothing is hazy or left unexplained. It would have been easy if not tempting to fill the movie with rugby but no doubt at the risk of alienating some of the audience and Clint Eastwood, who as a director has always found great human interest stories has created a good balance between action, character development and drama, although I felt the onfield rugby action was a little soft. It's always hard to capture sport in film, and I would go as far as to say only the 1960's 'Grand Prix' and 'Any Given Sunday' have successfully managed to do it. One wonders whether Eastwood would have been better off using actual game footage but for those non rugby enthusiasts it was probably fine as it is.<br/><br/>Freeman is more than excellent as Mandela. He is able to capture the warmness Mandela projected, his mannerisms and body posture to make himself believable and likable. He also brings a subtle enough attempt at Mandela's vocal range that whilst it slips from time to time and you know it's not Mandela and you are aware Freeman is trying to be Mandela it doesn't spoil the character. Matt Damon puts in a strong performance as François Pienaar but I felt that not enough was made of Pienaar character and this it must be said is not Damon's fault but Eastwoods. I remember those days well, and as much as I detested seeing South Africa win rugby, it must be said that Pienaar was indeed a fantastic spokesman, ambassador even not only the sport but for his country.<br/><br/>Eastwood Concentrates on Mandela pushing the Springboks and pushing the country to get behind them and yes it was a tremendous act of reconciliation given their political and racial attachments, but Pienaar was instrumental in making Mandela's plan work and without him both on and off the field the Bokke would not exist today. Sadly Matt Damon was limited to playing Pienaar as a sportsman , the occasional motivational speech and a limited dialogue I just felt not enough was made of Pienaar's real ability to lead by example both on and off the field. I never liked the Springboks as a team, especially after the most recent World Cup ( or Australian video referees) but it must be said Pienaar was a superb ambassador for the sport and his country and this does not come across in the film. Other than that it's an engaging film, there's some nice character development threads amongst Mandela's staff, the security forces and the Springbok players, the script is strong and there's a definite positive energy about the film, it leaves you with that sense of hope South Africa had back then. Looking at South African then and the South Africa now is as much as testimony to Mandela's greatness and it's such a shame it's all gone downhill since Mandela handed over the reigns. You don't need to be a rugby fan to enjoy this film, excellent."

","For years, the process of putting together a film about the icon of a man that is Nelson Mandela(and yes, Freeman completely becomes him in this, the manner in which he talks, the tenderness, the way he walks...) that does him justice has been going on. How to cover a man who struggled for literally decades, almost three of which he spent incarcerated, without leaving something out, glossing over things? It would be necessary to focus on a specific event. The World Cup of Rugby in 1995 was found to be ideal; indeed, by the man himself. Yes, to an extent, this is a sports movie(although that is by no means what it first and foremost is). It is a product of Hollywood, with some of what comes with. However, it is also an accessible picture that captures and communicates the essence of the inspirational man(and his cause) whom it is about with immense skill. Anyone can sit down and watch this, and few will miss its beautifully stated(with no manipulation and only minimal romanticizing) message: That we have to break the cycle of violence, that mutual understanding and respect, not hostility and suspicion, is the way to go. I hope that the former President of South Africa is happy with how this piece turned out. The acting, every single performance(including the extras), is amazing. This is gorgeously shot and edited. There isn't a boring or unengaging moment to be found in this. The dialog is well-written, clever and impeccably delivered. Other than one particular instance, the music is fitting and great. Eastwood, please don't directing stop until you simply cannot do so anymore. You're too damn good at it. There are several instances of intense violence(the games) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10"

","The movie takes its title from the poem of William Ernest Henley. It was composed in a very difficult moment in the life of Henley, and it was his way to find inspiration against terrible odds. The movie takes the poem and builds on it a great cinematic metaphor: the verses were a source of inspiration for Nelson Mandela in his long years of prison; after his election as President of South Africa, the poem would become an inspiration for winning the Rugby World Cup, as a symbol of overcoming the past and forging the reconciliation.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I must say, especially for his second part: Clint Eastwood mastered perfectly the rendering of the grim fight in the games, as well as the terrible training sessions. It has guts, it's high voltage there, everybody and everything is strongly motivated. And Matt Damon was the perfect choice to communicate all these emotions and all these motivations.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I think the first part of the movie was a bit too declarative. It could have been so in reality, and it's perfectly possible that at the beginning of his presidency Nelson Mandela had to be very didactic in order to explain to his people the need for reconciliation. However, it is difficult to make a credible cinematic personage with discourses. Especially when it is about a great historic personality, like Mandela. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman had here a very difficult task. I must say he approached the personage with great humility and he found this way the right key and the right tones. He was able to render the hero sincere in his declarations of principles from the first part and gave to the role a great touch of humanity, by a mix of modesty, humor, resolution, and even of a bit of necessary cunning.<br/><br/>Now, coming back to the history that inspired the movie, we could ask ourselves whether the finale of the World Cup was really the moment of reconciliation in South Africa. I think it was only a moment, a necessary and happy moment in a process that will take still many years."

","Eastwood has made an entertaining if conventional film about the South African 1995 rugby World Cup winning team and their relationship with President Nelson Mandela. <br/><br/>For someone reasonably familiar with the politics –sporting and otherwise – of South Africa the sometimes clumsy insertion of explanations grated a bit. However, given that a US audience could not be expected to be very familiar with the significance of the Springbok team as a symbol of the apartheid regime the presence of these explanations is easily forgiven.<br/><br/>I remember the watching Mandela's release from Robben Island live on television and I am also a sports follower and for these reasons the historic nature of the events portrayed in the film did resonate with me.<br/><br/>The story itself doesn't need to deviate much from actual events. Mandela's story itself is inspiring. Eastwood wisely picks a chapter from it that shows how he understood that he had to try to bring the white population into the new ""rainbow nation"" he was trying to build. Francois Pienaar was a great leader himself. His relationship with Mandela is dealt with well in the film. We see him gradually grasping and supporting Mandela's ideas for the new South Africa as many whites must have done during this period.<br/><br/>The game footage is well filmed and accurate. For example Andrew Mehrten's chance to win the final in normal time for New Zealand is shown.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are predictably excellent in the main roles. The supporting cast are also very good. The conclusion of the film takes the familiar path of most sporting underdog films. Plenty of slow motion build up and inspiring music to the decisive kick by Stransky!<br/><br/>A very well made movie. It is not the definitive Mandela biopic that will one day be made and will show in detail his political and personal struggle. I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless."

","I saw Invictus with a huge expectation resulting from the cast and the director's legacy; and also to admit the promos looked excellent. But the movie was somewhat disappointing. Apart from Morgan freeman, there was noting to remember after the end. And a large part of the damage was done by the lousy acting by Matt Damon. The straight face and emotionless acting by damon made the movie somewhat confusing – was it a sports movie or a movie about leadership and political up-lift? Matt was himself confused and maybe he decided to play without much thought like a junior high kid with no character in his role as a national captain of a sports team where racism made the sport a binding thread. Matt damon was like a kid who had to be held by the finger (by freeman) to even speak on behalf of the team. His character too should have portrayed leadership but it was more of a supporting actor kind of a role – that too royally screwed by his acting (he should continue to be bourne and nothing else).<br/><br/>To its backing, Invictus had a great story and a wonderful cast to do justice to the theme. Clint Eastwood used all his experience from million dollar baby for this genre (can't term either as a sports film though) and did a great job. These political dramas and real life stories may go haywire if not projected with the touch of class as required; especially in this case to match the aura of Mandela. A great script was there for the taking where a black leader uses the game to unite a country – the 'proteas' and the 'rainbow nation' theme and the production house has to a large extent done justice to it. <br/><br/>Morgan freeman – the light at the end of the tunnel was the one factor due to which this movie has soul. What a class act by the great actor. There are innumerable occurrences where he has played supporting roles; with a touch of class; but even he knew he was born for this one! (A wise investment considering he co-produced this film). The panache, with which he delivers 'Madiba', would probably be bettered; and even he would find it tough; only by Mandela himself. <br/><br/>Being a sports theme movie, the weightage to rugby was not given to the extent required, and it was all freeman's performance 'supported' with rugby. So at the end, you remember only the character and grandness of Freeman and nothing else. <br/><br/>Morgan freeman + Clint Eastwood + (racism / national pride / sports) = Blockbuster Hit <br/><br/>Morgan freeman + Clint Eastwood + (racism / national pride / sports) + Matt Damon = Average Hit <br/><br/>7/10 (5/10 for the movie + 2/10 for freeman)"

"freemantle_uk","8","0","0","17 February 2010"," The power of sport
","To make a good sports film you need a top class director, talented actors, and a theme that is more then the sport. Invictus is a film with ambitions of not just telling the story about how South Africa won the Rugby World Cup in 1995, but also about the early days of Nelson Mandala's presidency and the importance of the events for the new South Africa.<br/><br/>In 1994, Nelson Mandala (Morgan Freeman) is elected to be president of South Africa. Mandala starts a reconciliation process, after members of former Apartheid government to remain in their jobs if they wanted to. He also brought in members of the Apartheid security services to act as his bodyguards with his ANC bodyguards. Despite these efforts and his popularity, he still needs to find of uniting Black people who do not want Mandala to sell out and ensure he can provide on issues like crime, housing and social cares, whilst to reassure the White population that he isn't going to attack them and wants them to be a part of the new South Africa, and wants them to contribute. Mandala sees the best way to unite the nation is by sport, a weapon that was used against the Apartheid government with a boycott. South Africa had been picked to host the Rugby World Cup. But the South African rugby team, the Springbok, are unfit, lack experience and lack support of the Black population. They are calls to rename, and change the colours of the Springbok. But Mandala prevents this, and he asks the team's captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon) to inspire his team.<br/><br/>This is two films in one, a political film/bio-pic about Mandala trying to change South Africa and avoid either one race dominating the other, and of course a sport film about how an underdog defincing the odds. It took great skill by the screenwriter Anthony Peckham and the director Clint Eastwood. The political story is the most interesting aspect, with Mandala doing a forgive and forget reconciliation process, similar to Konrad Adenauer in West Germany after the Second World War. The ideas is for successful transition a government then you need to keep the same structure and allow professional civil servants to remind in their positions. Compare this to Post war Iraq where all the government system was dismantled, and all Ba'ath party members were executed from system, and helping turn that nation into right royal mess. There is also a financial reason why Mandala wanted to win over the whites, because they controlled the purse strings of South Africa, and also control the police and army. Mandala is shown to be a very intelligent man, who calmly argues his case and goes against easy political populism because he wants to improve South Africa for the long team. But he is also a man with family troubles and health issues, but wants to do the best for his country. The World Cup story is about how the underdogs of the whole tournament won, beating the likes of France and Australia. Pienaar and Mandala have to lead the team both on and off the field against tough competition. Their efforts help unite the nation. This is a cleaver film that tells this story. Fans of political films will like it. Fans of rugby will like it.<br/><br/>As well as the story, there are two great leads, Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Morgan Freeman is the only Hollywood actor who could Mandala, having both the look, and the acting talent. He plays Mandala as an intelligent, insightful man who is committed on improving his nation. He is quick witted, and they is a tragedy about his family problems. Freeman does do the Mandala voice well most of the time, but there are some moments where his voices slips into sounding like Red from the Shawshank Redemption. Matt Damon also does a good job playing a man who is less insightful, but a good sportsman and a good leader. He is one of the few White South Africans who isn't hostile to Mandala's presidency. Matt Damon builds up really well to play a professional rugby player, and does a believable South African accent. It's a shame there wasn't more of him in the film.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is obviously one of the best directors in Hollywood, having directed films like Unforgiven and Letter from Iwo Jima. But I think his direction of this film would be no different to any decent director, particularly the political scenes. But the rugby scenes are very good, from feeling like you are either in the stadium, watching from the stands, to being in the heart of the action. For an American Eastwood has a good understanding of the sport. I also liked that he casted former Bath player Zak Feaunati as Jonah Lomu.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is a very solid piece of work and people will enjoy it, there are some minor criticisms. The antagonism between the black and white bodyguards felt too staged, too Hollywood. It should have been less arguments, but more bitter. There also the Hollywood cliché of the guards overcoming their dislike for each other, playing rugby and again feeling staged. They were also some other moments that are hard to believe like a black boy listening to the World Cup final with the police on their car radio. Mandala also seemed a bit too obsessed with Rugby, seeming like he didn't govern on other important issues, and also skirted over issues like Mandala health and family problems. The film was also ignoring that there are still problems with South African sports, with rugby and cricket being played mostly by white people, whilst football (or Soccer to my North American friends) is seen as the black people's sport.<br/><br/>This is a good, entertaining film, with two good leads who deserve their Oscars nods, but it's not Clint Eastwood at his very best."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","16 February 2010"," A Soulful Victory
","Almost 80 years old, but that doesn't stop Clint Eastwood from delivering one gem after the other. This man truly loves cinema and telling stories but at the same time he also respects the reality of the source and attempts to stay true to them and the viewers. 'Invictus' tells the story of Nelson Mandela surrounding the 1995 Rugby match that was a historical victory for South Africa and a glorious 'union' for its people. While many of us know how the movie ends, it is the subtle inclusion of the strong themes, layers of the story and how the story unfolds that make 'Invictus' a very strong and poignant film. Moreover, this film is more historically accurate than a majority of Hollywood movies that claim to be 'based on a true story'. In addition, there is some great writing involved, especially in the dialogues. I also liked how Eastwood portrayed the racial tension with sheer subtlety.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is truly remarkable as Madeba. His diction may be faulty at times but he gets most of the nuances right. Matt Damon is splendid as Francois Pienaar as he gives a spirited performance. The supporting cast is strong. I particularly liked the actress who played the Pienaar's maid.<br/><br/>I am reluctant to categorize 'Invitus' as a 'sports' movie because it's about so much more than sports but if it is labeled under the sports section, then it is one of the best of that genre. Not only does it have soul, but 'Invictus' is very true to its history. Hats off to Eastwood and his crew, hats off to Pienaar and his team, hats off to the good people of South Africa and finally to the great Madeba."

Freeman is superb, although the accent wavers occasionally, and Damon is also strong as Francois Pienaar.<br/><br/>The sporting sequences are some of the most realistic ever committed to film. Some deep research must have gone into those sequences as you feel you are right on the field with the players.<br/><br/>The two and a quarter hours seemed to fly by, that's a sign you've watched something special.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"Robert_duder","8","0","0","7 February 2010"," As thee number one Clint Eastwood fan this one was good but not epically good like some make it out to be
","Now don't get me wrong, Invictus was a great film. I enjoyed it, it entertained me, there were good performances, Freeman's Mandela is terrific and the historical aspect was decent BUT most reviewers and critics both professional and amateur alike are hailing this as some amazing piece of emotional art and it just didn't quite hit me like that. I adore Clint Eastwood, like LOVE him as a director and an actor. I've said before Eastwood is probably the only director I see because of him behind the scenes. I think this was more cut and dry than most Eastwood projects. It was simple (in a good way) without any twists or turns or really intense moments. He told a story in the simplest of terms and it works mostly because of the performances of the lead cast. Now it pains me to say this but neither the direction, the film, or the lead cast deserve Oscar nominations. I realize the film and director weren't nominated but there was a lot of expectation. Everything about was good...but only good. Even the inspirational aspect and the typical sports fever was toned down and not quite emotionally moving.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is amazing. The man is a legend and is in his prime at 73 years old!! He gives a really solid performance as the incomparable Nelson Mandela. He is definitely the best performance in the film but it isn't really his best work, its just a good performance. Matt Damon plays quiet strong Rugby team Captain Francois Pienaar. Its a good performance but not as strong as Freeman and in my opinion not deserving of an Oscar nod whatsoever. Damon has had far better roles and in fact his ""subtle"" performance in this movie could also be considered quite dry and kind of uneventful. However Damon and Freeman have great chemistry together. The supporting cast are all solid and do their respective roles well but no one stands out like either of the lead actors.<br/><br/>I feel like maybe I am harping on this movie and I don't mean to be. It is absolutely well worth seeing and I think my score of the film reflects that. I suppose I expect a lot from Eastwood plus the hype following the film doesn't help but I guess I expected tears streaming down my face and cheering but it was just more of a smile and a nod when the movie was over. I would have more liked to have seen a full life story of Mandela. The best parts of the film had nothing to do with the Rugby aspect although obviously the whole film revolved around the sport and how important it was to bringing the country together but the best parts were about Mandela as a person and what he went through. A particularly powerful scene has Damon's character standing in Mandela's cell measuring out how small it was and imagining him in the cell. Please see this film especially if you're a fan of Damon, Freeman, or Eastwood but go in with decent expectations and not the overwhelming hype that is everywhere. 8/10"

","Invictus, Clint Eastwood's latest movie starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, is yet another success for the prolific 79 year old director. It is the true story of Nelson Mandela's struggle to unite South Africa after decades of apartheid, shortly after his release from prison and during his first term as President.<br/><br/>The mission that he sets upon himself and upon Matt Damon's character- Francois Pienaar- is unconventional to say the least. To win the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Mandela realizes that this will be the only way to unify such a divided nation. Francois is the captain of the Springboks, South Africa's national rugby team. He tells him ""If I got elected President, you can win the Cup."" However, not only is South Africa a huge underdog, the country is racially torn and greatly divided between the blacks and the Afrikaners, or white South Africans. The rugby team being made up almost solely of whites, the blacks traditionally cheer for the opposing team. <br/><br/>Mandela's vision of bringing his country together through sport and national pride is both a political and human triumph. Morgan Freeman plays him brilliantly and brings in front of our eyes the man whose charm, inner strength, courage and intelligence make him a hero to so many around the world. He is an outstanding Mandela and it is true that in many scenes it is hard to differentiate the two. His physique, mannerisms, voice, accent are all a perfect match. He is a replica of Nelson Mandela and in fact when asked who could interpret him in a film the former President answered: ""Morgan Freeman"", quite an endorsement for the actor. Matt Damon gives a very realistic portrayal as well, having gained weight and muscle for the role, and completely altering his accent.<br/><br/>We see the human, real side of Mandela- or ""Madiba"" as he was called- a man with his own struggles and doubts, and strained family relationships. When asked about his children he replies that he has forty two million of them and one senses his enormous sense of purpose and love. There are heartwarming moments when both his frailty and determination are exposed. For instance, when having memorized the names of each member of the team, he slowly steps onto the field and shakes their hands one by one, wearing the green Springbok jersey. Or when Francois and his team visit the miniscule jail cell where he was imprisoned for 27 years of his life, with a poem as his motivation to ""stand when all he wanted to do was lie down"", only to come out even stronger and ready to exceed his own expectations. <br/><br/>Fabio, who loves soccer and I know will watch the World Cup this summer almost as obsessively as Madiba was following the performance of the Springboks, thought the rugby scenes were too long. I found them to be really interesting, well done and fun to watch even though I was not familiar with the sport. <br/><br/>This is a powerful, solid movie with excellent performances. Lessons of forgiveness, team work, unity and perseverance make this film very inspirational. I very much enjoyed it as I have all of Mr. Eastwood's latest. His films are always of an extremely high caliber- in acting, script, cinematography and directing. This one is no exception.<br/><br/>My rating: 8.5 Fabio's: 7 Total score: 15.5 For more reviews, check out http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com"

","Clint Eastwood, the man with an aquiline look, seen in profound characters in ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", has come out with such a subtle and fine movie that it may take many by a surprise....<br/><br/>Inspired from the book ""Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation"" by John Carlin, the movie is based on the contribution of Mr. Mandela in inspiring his team to win the Rugby World Cup 1995, in order to unite the apartheid-torn land.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman once again delights us with his magnificent performance. His sheer screen presence makes us feel good, positive and really inspired throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is good as the team captain ""Francois Pienaar"". Genuine and humble along with alert and decisive is the character portrayal by Damon. There is a scene before the final match wherein on being asked ""Thinking about tomorrow ?"", he replies ""No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another. I was thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put you there.""<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon both have received an Oscar Nomination for their roles in the movie, that itself speaks for them and from my point of view Mr. Freeman should get the Oscar this year<br/><br/>All other characters have minor but an important role. This movie in my opinion is truly inspiring. Clint Eastwood continues to inspire after gems such as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling and others...<br/><br/>Do watch it....!!!!"
"gopher78","7","3","8","12 December 2009"," Good but not great
","I left the theater mildly entertained. Glad I saw the movie and thought Freeman and Damon did a good job, but I was really disappointed in all the side shots or stories that never pan out. Constantly trying to throw in some type of adrenaline type shot that completely fizzles. Motorcade being slowed down by celebrations, the shot to the top of the rooftops, security celebrating and not paying attention, and then we go to the next scene. It seemed like the writers were trying to add in historical perspectives but would only allow the barest of information. Mandela's family and relationship with his daughter and wife. Happens when the security details gets together for the first time. We see lots of tension and then the story just kind of goes on from there This happens often in the film and instead of adding to the main stories seems to take away and dilute the story But having said that, I did enjoy the movie and it makes me want to do a little more research to find more of the historical perspective."

"hackeron-1","2","2","5","6 February 2010"," Rugby ended racism in South Africa?
","The film made up of one half showing the problems Mandela faced during his presidency and how he tried to unite the county and end apartheid and one half showing the actual rugby games.<br/><br/>The scenes with Mandela (Freeman) were very well directed and the portrayal of Mandela was close to flawless (as expected from Morgan Freeman). However the focus was on the rugby and it seemed Mandela spent more time watching the games and talking to the players than doing anything else. You are left with a strong feeling of not having enough insight into Mandela's presidency.<br/><br/>This isn't helped by the rugby scenes being filmed akin to a live televised sporting event. You see the same angles ad nauseam and the camera is generally so wide you have no idea what is happening. The director also seems to refuse to use a shallow depth of field at any point - you have no idea what you should be focusing on even on close up angles.<br/><br/>It can be argued all this is intentional as you're not supposed to focus on the game, but should rather focus on the crowd and see just how much impact the game had in uniting the country. However this premise was hugely overplayed in my opinion and the movie makes it look like rugby single-handedly ended racism in South Africa.<br/><br/>With over an hour of rugby footage, it's hard to justify just how poorly the action was filmed and with an overplayed premise, even Morgan Freeman's fantastic acting can't save this one - 4/10."
"Jackpollins","6","2","5","29 December 2009"," Great performances, but keep your remote in hand
","Invictus is a film with great performances by Matt Damon & Morgan Freeman, but the film should be watched at home with remote in hand. Although this is no way to watch a movie, Invictus is one where you can fast forward through a lot of it. It is sometimes vague and boring, but mostly it is an inspirational, and entertaining sports film. The remote should be in hand, though because at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it drags too long, and the boring and vague parts should be skipped through. The film is directed by Clint Eastwood, who always finds a way to tell a good story. The film is about Nelson Mandala, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Freeman, a great actor all his own, is a friend of Mandala's which might of given him some strength. That said, Freeman could give a great performance whether he knows his character or not. Matt Damon is also good as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South Africa rugby team. The film, for teenagers will be more like an educational video rather than a film, but as a college and/or high school graduate, see Invictus at home so you can skip through the 10 or 15 minutes of vague and boring moments."
"AmyJenson1995","10","1","2","28 September 2015"," So moving and inspiring
","Nelson Mandela will always be a role model. He had so much compassion for the people around him. He believed in the Human being that we are able to elevate ourselves and accomplish things we thought we could never be able to. The power of the Human will, the Power of We when we come together to achieve a common goal.<br/><br/>Invictus is making him justice and is such an awesome tribute to this great man nicknamed Madiba. I cried a lot during this movie I still do each time I watch this awesome movie. In this world full of selfishness and violence, Invictus is like a fresh sunshine. There is no war no blood no violence. Just Unity, love, compassion and sport.<br/><br/>Sport is a mean to achieve peace between us, something which brings us together and allows us to achieve great things. Mandela realized it and used his National Rugby Team, once a symbol of the Apartheid which torn up the country he cherished the most for such a long time, to bring his Nation together and win the World Cup. This event was just a way to achieve a greater goal and it worked.<br/><br/>There would be no one better than Clint Eastwood, who as Mandela, is believing in the Human Being, to direct this awesome tribute. This movie is so enlightening, so moving, so inspiring it will make everyone cry of happiness and joy. It is also very sober, very simple only relying on the great talent of the actors to make a wonderful masterpiece.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is just so impressive in the role of Nelson Mandela. He shows his aura throughout the movie and he is proving once again he is such an awesome actor who can make us feel beautiful emotions. He is one of the kind and I can't see no one else to impersonate such a powerful role model.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is also awesome in playing Francois Pienaar the Springboks captain. He is inspiring in every scene he appears especially when he tries to tell his rugby fellow players that they are much worthier than they think they are. He is moving as he invited them to play and explain Rugby rules to young black kids in the ghettos surrounding Pretoria.<br/><br/>So yes we definitely need to see more movies like this which we are able to see how awesome the Human Being can be. This movie brings something very beautiful and pushes us to believe in ourselves and to come together to achieve great things. It counterbalances selfishness and greed with replacing them with compassion and unity.<br/><br/>So thank you so much Mr Mandela and Mr Eastwood for this awesome lesson of life. And may other will follow your path. x"

"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","23 February 2013"," Infectious.
","Invictus picks up where 2007 Bille August film Goodbye Bafana left off; the man himself, South African political prisoner turned international beacon for peace and prosperity Nelson Mandela, has been released from prison and walks down a makeshift aisle of people forming in a public street to applause and apparent joy. Where we freeze frame and leave that particular picture, a film depicting his time inside Robben Island jail and the bond he struck up with one of the ruling supremacist guards, we kick things off again in Eastwood's 2010 film Invictus: a conclave of jeeps; police vehicles and an everything-proof car harbouring the man himself rattling on down a road as he formally begins his first day in office as the president of South Africa. If you're a tad scant on your contemporary South African history, or if you're just a fan of those rare times when two completely different films that happen to cover similar ground just seem to ""fit"" when viewed together, then the two would make for a pretty decent double bill.<br/><br/>As it is, I have very little knowledge of said subject but I probably know more of it than the sport of Rugby. Ah, yes – the subject of Rugby. The film depicts the short burst of time during Mandela's five year reign as South African's first black president wherein he united a nation previously divided over the colour of one's skin. From his inception as its leader up to the conclusion of the 1995 Rugby World cup, which South Africa has been selected to host, we observe the true story of how the man tried to use what was a predominantly white pastime (and the presence of which, to some, still epitomises the old racial government) to build a sense of unity, patriotism and new order during this early stage of his reign. The film is a winner, an awareness piece and a sports movie you've already seen that depicts a somewhat incompetent squad of sports stars coming-good, this is true, but a really engaging piece of drama told eloquently and reassuringly as if it were some kind of bedtime story.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Mandela, a man taking control of a shattered nation coming out of decades of oppression guided towards the black population, and with troubles so deep that they extend to the petty squabbles within his own bureau between white security guards and black security guards. When we watch him driven during that opening scene, we observe the lush green turf and spanking pavilion the whites have access to for their rugby juxtaposed with the blacks, and their groggy looking football pitch fit for no one. Not a million miles away is Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar, the true-to-life rugby player and incumbent captain of the South African national side, nicknamed the Springboks. His team's in a mess, they can't win; he's the leader to whom everyone looks; he's got a shattered group of whoever in need of a kick-start – Mandela's just inherited a shattered nation, few things are going right in this fascist aftermath and he's got to rebuild things too: they've BOTH got to troubles. If only there was some sort of compromise that could help both of them...<br/><br/>The film does indeed go on to depict these two men bound by their respective responsibilities of leadership in wildly different fields, but a pairing of racial and sociological binaries in the sense Pienaar is this rugby player and rugby represents everything old and nasty. An early couple of instances at a rugby international against the English encapsulate both issues: the South Africans are trounced at home by a northern hemisphere team, while South African fans wave both the old and new South African flags-alike in disparate parts of the grandstands epitomising imbalance. We enjoy watching Mandela, away from his political duties that his peers around him deem far more important, become more and more transfixed by this game and the build up around the global event due to arrive on their shores. Drawing on inspiration from narrative film building blocks of the sports genre, as well as arriving with that sense of freshness inherent with sports films that depict people non-synonymous with the sport their undertaking (or not overly synonymous with success AT it), the strand revolving around the South African team and Pienaar's leadership works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Those obligatory scenes, when we recall the film has been made with the widest possible audience in mind, do not grate as much as usual in films of this ilk. When Pienaar makes the customary visit to Mandela's cell, he draws on the influence of how small this space is in comparison to his wide open, spacious domain of the rugby pitch. Furthermore, expositional lines reiterating Mandela's position of being in prison for so long but coming out again without the malice felt towards those responsible for the imprisonment are instances those who know a bit of history, or are familiar with our aforementioned Goodbye Bafana, do not need. Regardless, we are behind the film; we care, and we care because we've been presented with these characters and their problems in a manner more than competent enough in a film making sense. When the 'Boks thrash the Samoan team early on, the opposition are shot as faceless and anonymous: Eastwood really forcing our eye to meet with the South African team in their rugged and workmanlike glory as they do the job as convincingly as they do. The film is a powerful and engaging drama; another one of those 'gentle' Eastwood entries into the directorial canon of his, as he sways against his acting 'type' of the 1970s and 80s with another film dealing with violence; bigotry and such rather than use as a means to propel stuff. It's worth a look."
"piratecannon","7","1","2","29 December 2012"," I Think He Wants Us to Win the World Cup
","Over the past few weeks, the world has seen the release of two very well made sports movies. First we received The Blind Side, and now Invictus, the latest from Clint Eastwood. The 79 year old actor—whose best known for his roles as grizzled lawmen—has certainly proved his ability as a filmmaker during his twilight years, and Invictus is no exception. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to be slowing down one iota.<br/><br/>Invictus tells the story of Nelson Mandela (Freeman), the former President of South Africa and the man credited with unifying a country riddled with racism and turmoil in the wake of apartheid. Given Mandela's astonishing achievements, one would think the movie would be laden with dramatic flashbacks that clearly highlight the struggle he suffered as a prisoner for 27 years. Eastwood, it seems, has decided to take a different approach to telling this story.<br/><br/>The catalyst for this particular tale is rugby; a sport that many Americans know nothing about (admittedly, I knew little about the game going into the theater, but I did feel as if I had a better grasp of the sport as a whole when I walked out). This could easily be viewed in a negative way, as the bulk of the third act is focused solely on the rugby World Cup match that took place in 1995. Eastwood clearly revels in the brutality of the sport, as it nicely symbolizes the struggle the country was going through at that time. When teams lock arms and spar over field position, it's clear just how painful the process is, and this adds even more depth to the same issues that—unlikely as it is— District 9 grappled with only a few months earlier.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Francois Pienaar, captain of the South African rugby team. This is a role that seems well-suited to Damon, whose solemn determination is exactly what Mandela needed as a face for the symbolic triumph over prejudice that he saw embodied in the competition. The acting honors, however, clearly go to Freeman. If there's anyone who was destined to play Mandela, it's him—Freeman's mastery of the man's mannerisms, accent, and general presence is astounding. There aren't really any scenes that call for the emotional outbursts typically needed to garner an Oscar nod, but I have a feeling the sheer power of the movie as a whole will land Freeman a much deserved nomination.<br/><br/>That's the thing about Invictus–at its core, it seems to be nothing more than an inspirational sports film, but there are many other issues rippling just beneath the surface. One could nitpick about the decision to film this ""documentary style,"" with only limited (extremely limited) glimpses into Mandela's past, and I'd have to agree that it leaves a little bit of a hole in an otherwise absorbing movie. The message it sends to audiences, though, is what makes the final product so effective. And that, of course, is that athletics play a very important role in any society: they act as the ultimate unifying medium. Themes of bias and discrimination generate a lot tension, but when the final match is underway, everyone puts their differences aside (and inadvertently comes to the realization that we're all one and the same).<br/><br/>As far as motivational sports films go, you could do a lot worse, and the patient directorial eye of Eastwood will cause you to linger on every frame. I wouldn't say the movie is unforgettable, but it is a welcome pick-me-up that takes an optimistic stance on the nature of mankind."

","So I read some comments about how this movie is too Hollywood, too predictable, and why would a leader even be concerned with this sporting event. All I can answer is that you have lived too much in Canada or the USA. In Canada and the USA sports are important, but not that important. In places like Europe, South America, Africa, or parts of Asia certain sports are VERY IMPORTANT!<br/><br/>Consider the recent football (soccer for you North Americans) match between England and Germany. Cameron and Merkel sat in front of the TV watching the game and not doing any business whatsoever other than relaxing with a few ""brewskies."" Even though Europe was falling apart. Sports moves people in these countries like no other thing can. <br/><br/>This movie is very good and I liked it. I found it very emotional. This movie though is similar to the German movie, ""Das Wunder von Bern"" (The Miracle of Bern). It talks about the hardship and how the people came together to find a little happiness from the desperation of reality. Though the difference in the two movies is perspective.<br/><br/>So how do you know if you will like this movie? Easy, how much are you attached to things like World Cup Football, or World Cup Rugby. If you are not attached emotionally to these types of things you will find this movie lackluster. If you are very attached and can get into the emotional spirit of the sporting event, then you will like this movie. It really is that simple, that black and white."

","During Nelson Mandela's first year in charge as president of South Africa, South Africa was the host nation of The Rugby World Cup and he seized the chance to use rugby as a reconciliation tool for the injustice throughout the years between the whites and the blacks. I think this is a great theme as a political related movie as lots of other movies about political policies do not have the sparkles as it does in Invictus which flawlessly blended politics with sports.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film was phenomenally done. The very first scene of the film was truly memorable, Nelson Mandela's vehicle went past a path which divide the whites and the blacks. It was a mixed feeling among the South Africans on Mandela took up the role as the president, the whites believed that things would change completely and things never went the things they were; while the blacks was liberated with the hope Mandela would bring, the triumph he would bring. Clint Eastwood vividly captured the skeptic of the society and that point was only the very beginning with unforeseen amount of struggles laying ahead. The dawn was only the herald of the day with so many unexpected may occur.<br/><br/>The film had also done remarkably well on depicting the significance of the springbok as an emblem to the white South Africans. It was a revelation of the fidelity of whites' devotion to rugby. On the other hand, it was a symbol of the tragic occurrence at the Apartheid for the blacks which they wished to abandon and put it behind them. Hence, there was a clash between the two racial groups shared different codes of values. I think the opening was sensational with the way it construed the historical background, the political divide between two groups of people and most importantly it portrayed the wrath of the people towards Apartheid. Another tremendous scene of the film took place when a voluntary helper handed out clothes for the warmth of the children lived in poverty. Every child was ecstatic after been given out the clothes except one who received a South African jersey with the springbok badge on it, I could reminiscent the pain in them through that shot. It unveiled the hatred of the suffered towards the unequal treatment during the darkest hours in Apartheid.<br/><br/>The movie came up with a happy ending which South Africa won the rugby World Cup as the host nation of the event. All the people over the nation were triumphant over the victory of this international historic event. But the most important thing of all is that it unify the two groups of people in conflict, the whites and the blacks who didn't get along with each other, a reconciliation was met between them. It was a great scene which captures the cheerfulness shared among everyone regardless of the age, gender, social class and race. I could felt it deep down in my heart that it was a great moment, it was a moment of change.<br/><br/>I think highly of the amount of studies Eastwood had done. He has kept the film very real and accurate with the content such as how his fellow Africans calling him comrade and Madiba which established an intimate relationship between them. He has characterized Mandela as a forgiving figure who has already forgiven the people who locked him up into a intolerable cell room from the first moment he was released. The two key casts – Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon played exceptionally well, they both once again proved themselves as two of the best actors in their generation. They played well with their imitation of South African accent which makes the native people feel more nostalgic and indigenous Freeman to them. So overall, I am entreated by this movie with the new approach with such political based materials. It is truly inspirational for the people who have already seen this movie. I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone as I do believe that it can change the way we feel the World we are living in and fully understood the historical shift behind the struggles South Africans had faced."

","Morgan Freeman portrays anti-apartheid activist and former South African president Nelson Mandela in this Clint Eastwood-helmed political drama adapted from author John Carlin's book The Human Factor: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed the World. Set just after the fall of apartheid and during Mandela's first term in office, The Human Factor explores how the political prisoner-turned-president used the 1995 Rugby World Cup -- which was hosted by South Africa -- as a means of bringing blacks and whites together after decades of violence and mistrust.This biographical sports drama is directed by Clint Eastwood and it co-stars Matt Damon.<br/><br/>After 27 years in jail, Nelson Mandela is released in 1990 and subsequently elected President of South Africa. His immediate challenge is ""balancing black aspirations with white fears"", as racial tensions from the apartheid era have not completely disappeared. While Mandela attempts to tackle the country's largest problems—crime and unemployment, among many others—he attends a game of the Springboks, the country's rugby union team. Mandela recognizes that the blacks in the stadium cheer against their home squad, as the Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds. Mandela remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela convinces a meeting of the newly-black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with Pienaar a poem, ""Invictus"", that had inspired him during his time in prison.Pienaar and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both white and black, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by some 50 years of racial tensions. For many non-whites, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolized white supremacy. However, both Mandela and Pienaar stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the country.Things begin to change, however, as the players interact with the locals. <br/><br/>This Clint Eastwood film provides a great theme and it is sentimental with inter-racial relations themes particularly in South Africa with the use of rugby - the country's primary sports.It provides inspiration as well together with a tribute to the country's great man in Nelson Mandela.Although it gathers Eastwood,top Hollywood actors and top South African actors,one thing about the movie is its lack of vitality and energy that would hold the viewer in watching it.Nevertheless,both Matt Damon as the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar and Morgan Freeman as former South African president Nelson Mandela inhabit their real-life characters with admirable conviction."
"seth_85","10","1","2","17 November 2011"," Experiencing History
","One of the most interesting and the most inspiring history films of the decade is Clint Eastwood's Invictus. The film is based on the book written by John Carlin ""Playing the Enemy"". It is the story of the South African president Nelson Mandela (starring Morgan Freeman) who after his release from 27 years of imprisonment on the Robben Island chooses extremely creative way to bring about reconciliation. His plan involved employing the captain of African rugby team Francois Pienaar, starring Matt Damon, to win with the ""Springboks"" the World Cup 95' and by the means of mutual victory culturally unify the African nation. In the opening scene Eastwood gives a viewer a short insight into what exactly the film is going to be about. It starts with an establishing shot showing a green sport field where white young boys, dressed in striped jerseys, practice rugby. When we hear a whistle the boys restart the practice and the camera zooms in. Then there is a tracking shot used to follow the ball until it lands near the fence. Suddenly, using a crane shot the camera jumps over a sharp fence and traversing road in order to show a completely different image on the opposing sport field. On this pitch we can see black boys practicing football. The whole pitch, surrounded by a dilapidated fence, is covered with brownish dust. The boys are dressed in dirty clothes chasing chaotically something that resembles ball. Most of them have bare feet and are noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys. Then Eastwood swaps the pitches several times, using a crosscuts, as if to enable a viewer to see the differences between them. Moreover, using medium and long shots interchangeably he allows a spectator to observe the scenery in greater detail. After several seconds we can hear hoots from the road and both the black and the white boys stop their practice to see what is happening. Now the camera points at the crossing road where a line of cars approaches the scene. The black boys start cheering and screaming continuously ""Mandela!"" ""Mandela!"". When the camera pans 180 degrees we can see white boys curiously watching the passing cars. Suddenly, Eastwood uses full shot to point at one of the boys and his coach. When the boy asks his instructor ""Who is it, sir?"" the instructor replies ""It is a terrorist Mandela. They let him out. Remember this day, boys. It is the day when our country went to the dogs."" After the dialog the director uses a jump cut to show a short stock footage montage (an aspect ratio changes to 1.33:1) which spans the tumultuous four years between Nelson Mandela's release from prison and his inauguration as President of South Africa. Invictus is not only the story about Nelson Mandela, Francois Pienaar or a rugby Cup, but also the story about problems that all South Africans encountered in the 90s. The film presents the country which is divided into the whites and the blacks and two prominent persons who struggled to unify their country by the means of rugby Cup that took place in South Africa in 1995. Invictus is a brilliant history movie, taking its viewers to a journey through the South Africa of 1990s, faithfully portraying this particular period of time. Through history films like Invictus people can watch some great personalities not only from the last decade like Nelson Mandela but also persons from a totally different epoch. It is not easy to do such kind of movies as this genre very often requires specific props, language spoken by actors, costumes, or even specially designed whole cities to express the authenticity of a particular period. I believe that this genre provides us not only with a lot of entertainment but is also an excellent history lesson."
"stock-1","10","1","2","5 May 2011"," Good for the Heart
","This movie is better as any medicine to cure heart problems. The best part is that it's not some fairy tale, but really happened. Nelson Mandela is the only 21th Century Statesman who can stand in the footsteps of the founding fathers of America. Clint Eastwood is the producer and director to watch, as he knows where to put his attention and efforts into. Morgan Freeman really is Nelson Mandela inside this movie excelling way above the Oscar for best leading actor. That he was nominated and didn't win, only testifies that there still are certain matters to be sorted out in Hollywood. Matt Damon does a great job in the role of the South African rugby captain Francis Pienaar. The strange mix of suspense and excitement among the team of bodyguards when they have to escort Nelson Mandela around the country and during his 04:00 am training walk, underlines the motive of Mandela's decision to guide the Springbok Rugby team, the former symbol of Apartheid, to the world-champion title."
"tsexton9","10","1","2","1 May 2011"," Playing for Something More
","Invictus will inspire those who have never even heard of rugby. The story is about so much more than a sport, but without the sport the changes in South Africa may not have occurred. Nelson Mandela, played by Morgan Freeman, is a man of great character and moral strength but struggles to unify a nation faced with years of prejudices. That unifying factor becomes the sport of rugby where Mandela meets Matt Damon's character, Francois Pienaar. Francois, the Captain of the South African National Rugby Team, believes in his country and Mandela despite teammates and a family that has their share of doubts (Barber, Freeman, Moore, & Eastwood, 2009). <br/><br/>Mandela and Pienaar directly faced the fates of their country and rugby team that were very dim. Through persistence and courage, both of them change the team and country the have been entrusted to lead. Along the way, they become friends and motivated by one another. Mandela and Pienaar both become increasingly interested in the lives of each other. Nelson follows every moment of the rugby team and Pienaar takes his team to the prison that Mandela lived for many years (Barber, Freeman, Moore, & Eastwood, 2009). <br/><br/>Two men, who were united by a sport and the love of their country, changed everything around them. The games played during the Rugby Championship were just games to the other teams but the were something more to South Africa. The team was playing for the fate of their country and that unity could not be ignored. To some sports may seem silly but they have the power to do great things. Sports are a universal language the breaks many barriers around the world. It gives countries the way to unite and poor children hope for a better day (Barber, Freeman, Moore & Eastwood, 2009). <br/><br/>South Africa had rugby to unify its country and Michael Oher had American football to bring him a better day. The stories of Invictus and the Blind Side, show how sports are often much more than children or men playing with a ball. They give us an understanding of how much lives can be changed when we have something to unify us together.<br/><br/>Overall, I truly enjoyed Invictus despite knowing very little about rugby. I felt that rugby was going to be a huge hurdle for me before watching the movie but I walked away inspired by this movie. The acting of Freeman and Damon is excellent. The rugby scenes were incredibly realistic. They filmed the rugby scenes with angles that gave the viewers a firsthand experience. The noise of the crowds also brought an intriguing feel about the sport (Barber, Freeman, Moore, & Eastwood, 2009). This movie is definitely one I will recommend to others. <br/><br/>References Barber, G. (Producer), Freeman, M. (Producer/Actor), Moore, T. (Producer), & Eastwood, C. (Director). (2009). Invictus.

"bkoganbing","9","1","2","1 April 2011"," His Unconquerable Soul
","Invictus is one of those sports films that is more than about sports. It transcends athletics and delves deeply into world politics and human rights. Nelson Mandela who learned so many universal truths to heart in his long prison exile, learned another in that nothing on earth can unite people like sports. He may have learned that by knowing something of the life of Jackie Robinson who when he integrated American Major League Baseball found that racial differences could be bridged easier than you would imagine by fans with the common interest of seeing that Brooklyn Dodger team win.<br/><br/>If such for a borough of the City of New York how much greater for the South African nation ruled so long by an evil doctrine of separatist White Supremacy. The black majority was now asserting itself, but Mandela did not want to preside over a nation of vengeance. The previously all white Springbok Rugby team, now integrated could unite the nation if it won the World Cup in that sport. <br/><br/>So Mandela personally interested himself in that idea and recruited the Springbok player/coach in his crusade. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon who played Mandela and the coach Francois Pienaar made a dream happen and had blacks and whites behind the Springboks in their quest.<br/><br/>Two things that American audiences might have trouble grasping is that in the Mandela cabinet as in many other countries there is such a thing as a Minister of Sports. Our athletics in America are far more a private institution, that is unheard of in the USA. We might have a State Athletic Commission for boxing and other violent type sports that are mostly concerned with athletic safety. But that wasn't even always the case.<br/><br/>And of course Rugby football is not played here. I have a young friend from South Africa who just scoffs at our National Football League and all the protective gear those guys wear. American audiences weaned on Monday Night Football seeing these Rugby players in sneakers, shorts and team jerseys playing it as rough as the NFL might get a bit of culture shock.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood as director had a marvelous eye for the time of history he was filming and for the culture of South Africa. But he was best at handling his actors as Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon received Best Actor and Supporting Actor nominations for their roles. If there is a fault with Invictus it is that these two so dominate the film that no other characters really develop. But these are two who can hold an audience's attention.<br/><br/>For a really compelling film about one of the great men of the last and current century and the time he lived in, you must absolutely see and be informed and educated by Invictus."
"Rodrigo_Amaro","10","1","2","16 March 2011"," It's not about winning the game, it is about how you play it that really counts
","In ""Invictus"" Clint Eastwood takes us back to a divided South Africa of the post-Apartheid after Nelson Mandela's being elected President and making a new government, the first one elected by the people. And it is in this fragile nation with enormous tense between South-Africans and English South-Africans that a political game and a rugby game will be decisive for the country's union. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, perfect as Mandela, is the elected leader trying to unite a divided country by making a unconventional choice by supporting South Africa rugby team during the Rugby's World Cup, at one time known for its racist songs while playing during the Apartheid; and now they are a failed team led by captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon) and a team composed in its majority of white players, and where the only adored star of the team is a black player loved by many fans. <br/><br/>Mandela knows that only changing the laws and building things are not enough to make a different and better country, opposite to the one he only knew behind bars for almost thirty years. He needs to join forces and show to everyone he's the right guy on command and that things can be worked for better. His alliance with Pienaar is a brilliant strategy, he teaches to the captain of the team valuable things on the importance that rugby has on the country (but only if they win because that brings a little bit of closeness between people, everyone together for one cause, and Mandela is promoting a new country to the world showing that a black President is as much as good as a white one) and Pienaar tries to risen up the moral of a broken team, playing his game efficiently.<br/><br/>The positive, different and unique strategy used by Mandela worked perfectly, and not only his ability in working with the team and the results they got in the nation, but also he calmed the tension between the former members of the secret service (white), and his personal security (black) who didn't get along right from the start of the new government. In the end, it doesn't matter winning the game, whether the political game or the rugby game, it's all about play it and stick it to the end that really counts, that really makes the difference. Many other politicians used of weapons and false propaganda's to spread terrible messages or evil ways to built a better nation, but here we see a man, almost alone, that used his power and presence to bring together something that was faded to be shattered forever. <br/><br/>Two spectacular performances by Damon and Freeman made of ""Invictus"" a really great picture, that also has a magnificent screenplay joining together a real event story with a sport themed film (with a exciting final match in the last part). Eastwood's unusual choice of film to direct proved to be a excellent and beautiful choice, an nice inspiring film these days, very very rare to find. It is a outstanding work but it should have gather more audiences, it looks like that people turned their backs from this precious gem. This is a example of what movies should be, giving some great, positive and realistic examples without preaching or selling an idea.

"Buddy-51","9","1","2","8 August 2010"," Making the world a better place one rugby match at a time
","One of the best movies of 2009, ""Invictus,"" written by Anthony Peckham and directed by Clint Eastwood, takes us to a fascinating moment in modern history.<br/><br/>It's the mid-1990s; the racist and repressive system known as Apartheid has recently been overturned in South Africa, and former political prisoner Nelson Mandela has just been elected the nation's first black president. Tensions are running high among the Afrikaners, who fear that the majority blacks will use their new-found power to exact revenge on the white minority. Many of the blacks, on the other hand, find it difficult and distasteful to work in tandem with a people who had degraded, oppressed and even imprisoned them for so long.<br/><br/>Into this quagmire steps Mr. Mandela, a true believer in the power of redemption and reconciliation to change hearts and influence policy, who hits upon a scheme to unite the two factions through their mutual love of rugby, rallying the nation behind the team known as the Springboks, which, for the blacks, once represented all the things they despised about the Apartheid regime. Against massive odds of both history and human nature, this amazing man manages to heal old wounds and forge a new nation based on equality and respect for all.<br/><br/>Derived from the novel ""Playing the Enemy"" by John Carlin, ""Invictus"" (the title of a Victorian poem Mandela uses as a guide for his own life) could easily have been just another self-congratulatory exercise in ""do-gooder"" drama - but its heartfelt honesty, its accomplished direction and its world-class acting make it so much more. Morgan Freeman gives a towering, yet carefully understated, performance as the near-saintly Mandela, a role he was clearly born to play, bringing true conviction to the moral strength, innate compassion and basic decency of a man who suffered so much at the hands of others, yet who refused to allow personal bitterness and a desire for revenge to determine the course his life - or his nation - would take. Instead, Mandela, at great personal risk to his own popularity, used his experience to build bridges and to set his nation on a path towards healing that would allow it to take its rightful place in a modern, more enlightened world where every man is equal and where citizens work together for a common good. Indeed, Mandela is probably the greatest argument for the Great Men Theory of history the past half century has had to offer. <br/><br/>And Matt Damon, boasting a flawless South African accent, has probably never been better than he is here, playing Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springboks, who is so impressed with Mandela's continued faith in the human race despite all he's been through that he rallies his own team members (most of them white) to join with the president in playing for the glory of the new South Africa - an effort that led them to winning the Rugby World Cup in 1995.<br/><br/>The beauty of ""Invictus"" is that it doesn't find it necessary to over-dramatize the racial tension or to indulge in ginned-up melodramatics to get its message across. The racism here is often of a more subtle kind - a careless word here, a thoughtless put-down there - and the movie does an expert job conveying that fact.<br/><br/>Recently, I wrote that I couldn't imagine seeing a more inspiring and uplifting film than ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song."" Well, now I've just seen one. It's called ""Invictus"" - and it is not to be missed."
"reelinspiration","8","1","2","8 July 2010"," INVICTUS: Mandela inspires a nation
","INVICTUS opens with the image of a road dividing the well groomed, green rugby field for the white African team and the rough, dirt lot where black African children play. Coming down the road is the motorcade of newly elected President Nelson Mandela.<br/><br/>This is a movie about inspiration. President Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) resolve to unite the nation without punishing his suppressors after serving twenty-seven years as a political prisoner is indeed inspiring. Through his example, he teaches his country how to forgive.<br/><br/>Knowing that his county is still racially divided in the wake of apartheid, the President enlists the help of the national rugby Team Captain (Matt Damon in his most buff and tan) to unite the country with the universal language of sports. Africa is hosting the Rugby World Cup Championship and he knows that the eyes of the world are on them. His first task is to inspire the team to overcome their losing streak and win the championship. But the bigger challenge is to inspire his hostile countrymen to rally around the mostly white team.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the sports section of the movie isn't as moving as it could have been and therefore less inspiring. President Mandela gives the Team Captain the poem, ""Invictus"" for inspiration. (Mandela got strength from this poem to survive those hard years in prison.) The Team Captain surprises his players with a visit to Mandela's tiny prison cell. But an opportunity is lost when he doesn't share the poem with his team. The audience hears the poem as a voice over. (My frustration increased when I couldn't make out a few of the words.)<br/><br/>Perhaps the screenwriter was trying to keep to the true story. In sports stories there is always the problem of creating suspense when we know who will win. And this definitely is a problem here. Apparently, the game was not an emotional roller coaster.<br/><br/>I'm not saying there are no inspiring moments. There are several. It's just not as moving as it could have been. (I wonder if director Clint Eastwood was trying to avoid having the movie called sappy...?) It is still a three, maybe three and a half, star movie. Who wouldn't root for Morgan Freeman in a strong (however tall) portrayal of Nelson Mandela?<br/><br/>Movie blessings! Jana Segal, Reel Inspiration"

","Invictus is the third movie from the team of Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman and this time too they succeeded to bring us a brilliant movie. Invictus is based on the early years of Nelson Mandela as a newly elected President of Republic of South Africa,it was the time for change,the end of apartheid and the beginning of new era.The country was divided and hopeless, crime rate,poverty were increasing,country was not working right so was it's Rugby team and the world cup was on it's way in the year 1995.Country needed a inspiration,a medium to get united and to break the walls of creed and color.Nelson Mandela knew his country needed a inspiration,a moment that make the whole country feel proud will also help in bringing people close to each other and thus it was important for it's country to win the Rugby world-cup.So Mandela took the matter in his own hands,he meet with the Rugby team captain Francois Pieenar and made him realize that whole country is counting on them and how can they help in unite the whole nation if they win the world cup.<br/><br/>Nelson Mandela is portrayed by my favorite actor Morgan Freeman.Now,the problem is that both Morgan Freeman and Nelson Mandela are popular faces.we are familiar with both of them so,it is really hard to accept Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela.This is why a role of popular person should always been played by an unpopular face,like Ben Kinglsley in Gandhi,i didn't know who is Ben Kingsley when i was watching Gandhi so it was not difficult for me to accept him as Gandhi.But here Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor and that make difficult for me to accept him as Nelson Mandela but some minutes after movie starts,i never felt like i was watching Morgan Freeman and that is an real achievement for an actor and Morgan Freeman shows the brilliant performance here. Matt Demon was also brilliant in the role of Rugby team captain Francois Pieenar.<br/><br/>I think Clint Eastwood done a beautiful job here,his direction literally saved the movie,there was not a single moment in the movie where i felt detachment.The whole story of movie was so plane and predictable,but i felt movie very interesting and entertaining as it was great experience for me to see a movie based on great leader Nelson Mandela.Invictus is not completely a sports movie,the movie is also biopic which gives the glimpse of life of Nelson Mandela as a newly elected president,his views and thoughts towards his country and it's peoples and how he try to unite his nation,the movie is filled with very well written quotes and speeches.The movie makes us familiar with the historic moments of a country and Clint Eastwood succeeded in this completely.The scenes of the rugby match should have been much more energetic and passionate but like Clint Eastwood's other works this movie also remains calm and sober all time.Otherwise,the movie is very well made and was perfect in all the departments.<br/><br/>Invictus is not just a normal sports movie.The movie shows the importance of sports for a nation and it's peoples,sports unite us,you support a single team with the same spirit your religion and color have no importance here the only thing important here is your country. Because of those moments of celebrations or grief that we felt with one spirit for one team it realize us how much we love our country.Invictus will be respected and remembered personally by those who feel historical importance of the events occur in the movie,but it will also be enjoyable movie for others too from different part of the world."

","When I first time heard for this movie I was astonished . I didn't see something like this so I expected good movie . Theme is really attracting and I saw ratings and I decided to wait for its cinema release . Movie was released in December but in Croatia it was in March so I decide to wait it on DVD . I would feel stupid if I watch something what will be released for two months . There are few interesting facts like its Oscar nominations . Great two leading roles were really good fact . Trailer didn't show much things but then I got it o DVD . This isn't wasting time and I was really astonished how movie is good .<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood as director was world class . Maybe this movie isn't in level of his masterpieces like Gran Torino but it is really good . This isn't some dramatic movie but it is in spirit of whole atmosphere . I can't see anything extremely bad about this movie . Eastwood is one of the best directors and actors and now he confirmed his sense for directing . I can see that he made one drama with nice atmosphere soul and complicated situations . This isn't some movie which can beat some dramas because of its sometimes too idyllic moments . It is really good drama and it is easily winning watcher's heart .<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela was really excellent . You can see how his experience is bringing quality to this movie . His great acting is again confirmed with one really conclusive acting mixed with his great narrative parts . There weren't any special mistakes so his acting was great . He definitely was brilliant with his strong performance and his physically similar look with Mandela . This movie is really nicely showing problems and happiness so Freeman was on level .<br/><br/>Matt Damon as Francois Pienaar wasn't so good as Freeman but also very conclusive acting . He was maybe too unhappy during movie but he showed great spirit . I think he was also great choice for this role . His appearance was maybe great showing of his character acting . He really has a sense for acting so we could see it in this movie . I think he is one of the best younger actors . He didn't show some mistakes so it was really good .<br/><br/>All in one really good drama . I am definitely recommending this movie."
"dvc5159","7","1","2","10 March 2010"," At the age of 79, Eastwood proves he is still a master filmmaker.
","Clint Eastwood is not only my favorite hero, but one of my very favourite movie directors. There is a certain way that he uses to direct his films. It is slow-paced, subtle, but concentrated and focused. He doesn't rely on visual effects and smash-cut editing to get the ball rolling for his movies. He doesn't rely on Parkinson's afflicted cameramen during slow moments. No, he does it the good ol' fashioned way. Conservative he may be, but it's that method that distinguishes his craft from others. It's a very recognizable and refreshing trait after seeing giant robots smash each other from screen to screen.<br/><br/>Having said that, Eastwood's latest film ""Invictus"" is a masterpiece. Yes, I mean that. Why? Not because it is a simple story that is not always original, but it is a simple story that is executed beautifully. Eastwood's directorial traits are seen here, and it brilliantly shows. Like Don Siegel and Sergio Leone before him, Eastwood manages to bring out the best, sharpest and most humanistic performances out of the actors in the movie. So what if they all spoke in English? The same thing happened in Schindler's List, did anyone complain?<br/><br/>Moving on to the performances. I swear I was watching the real Nelson Mandela on the screen instead of Morgan Freeman. It is proved that he did not get chosen for this movie based on his uncanny resemblance to Mandela. Here Freeman IS Mandela, he nails the performance, he owns the movie, he is the driving force of the movie. Freeman shows depth as Mandela, as well as wit, dry charm and a huge humble side to him. It's a performance which is nothing short of phenomenal and is really Freeman's role of his career.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is also noteworthy as Pinear, the rugby captain. His South African accent is very convincing, his performance is full of vigor and confidence, and it further solidifies the fact that he is a great actor as well as a great action hero, a fact proved in the ""Jason Bourne"" series. Damon says that working with Eastwood makes him want to emulate Eastwood's career I would love to see that.<br/><br/>With fine performances (even the supporting actors), the simple story is fleshed out in a solid fashion. It may not be original, but it is VERY inspiring to see the Rugby team giving their all to win. For their country. For peace. Eastwood wrings out the richness in such a simple story but since it is true the screen flows strikingly with the brilliant theme of hope and courage.<br/><br/>Not forgetting the jazz-inspired (another Eastwood trait) music and the strikingly beautiful cinematography by Tom Stern, Eastwood, like PIXAR Animation Studios, shows class and versatility as one of Hollywood's most gifted filmmakers and storytellers, and he shows no signs of slowing down or weakening out. This is a must see, for everyone; men, women and even children to see. I give it my highest recommendations.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 10/10."
"yris2002","Null","1","2","27 February 2010"," Well made, emotion-evoking ""bio-pic"", supported by two outstanding actors
","Clint Eastwood has done, once again (but it was highly predictable), a great job, in this unusual bio-pic, in the way the story of Nelson Mandela, being now the president of a country which had kept him prisoner for 24 years, is seen through the adventures of the national rugby team, now become the binding element of whites and blacks.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is one thing with Nelson Mandela, reminding him in his physical appearance so perfectly, and he manages to convey the temperament of a man ready to forgive so much, but also self-confident, knowing exactly where he wants to lead his country, and that South Africa will have to become one nation. Matt Demon is always believable, perfectly fit, both physically and psychologically, for his role, and offers moments of deep emotional involvement, mainly when he sees Mandela's former cell and thinks of his suffering past, when the leader's moral inner strength was his only weapon to go on. The movie flows with increasing pathos, bringing to light a strong consciousness of need for fraternity through forgiveness and respect for everyone.<br/><br/>The genius of Clint Eastwood delivers another deep portrait of solid, true, honest men, and in a world always lacerated by false myths, leaves a message in favour of those universal, and ever founding values of human life, so taken for granted in words, but so difficult to find in real life."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","20 February 2010"," A ""solid"" film that condenses the tournament and the importance thereof, but nothing more than that
","I read recently an article that had Eastwood talking about the Oscar ""snub"" in regards best film and best director for Invictus. He talked about having been awarded loads so it was just not his time and the article also included Freeman saying his chances of winning off his best actor nomination as being ""slim to none"". At no point during the article did anyone involved say anything like ""you know what, Invictus is a sturdy film and a decent enough way to spend two or so hours but in terms of saying it is the best anything then that's really pushing it and if we're being honest even the best actor nod is a bit of a joke – although if there was an Oscar for best rugby film then yeah, we'd have that in the bag"". Although that would have made for a terrible sound bite, at least it would have been honest because this is perfectly true and the lack of awards should surprise nobody – Invictus simply isn't a film that deserves to be held up for time as the ""best"" at anything it tries to do.<br/><br/>At this point let me stress that it is not a bad film – not at all. It is a solid attempt to do a sports movie that sums up the rugby world cup while also capturing the cultural significance of that event; and being able to pull off even one of those would have been impressive. As it is, it makes a good fist at both, good enough to be able to make for a study and pretty entertaining film but at the same time it doesn't do either well enough to hit home or to be worthy of really sticking in the memory as a film (which to me is more of an accolade than whatever they happen to give a little statue to this year). On the sports side I thought that the film did a pretty poor job of conveying the excitement and the tension of the tournament. This was perhaps understandable in a two-hour film and the focus was rightly put on the final with New Zealand. However this game was then delivered without a great deal of passion of heart (or at least not much that translated well to the viewer in the way great sports movies do). What it seemed to be doing is using slow-motion and music to hark to the great importance of the game rather than the specific tensions of the moment, and this puts the onus on the other side of the film to deliver.<br/><br/>In this regard the same is true – close, but not cigar. The task of summarising a sea-change in a county is not easy one and Invictus makes as good a go at it as one could fairly expect. However this is not the same as saying it gets it, because it doesn't quite get there. The script really has to boil stuff down to the essentials to make it fit into a film and in doing this it really has to simplify things to the point where there is lots of explanatory dialogue, which is forgivable about the matches perhaps but it does get a bit much to have the political challenges in South Africa treated this way. These two short-comings (for this is what they are rather than failings) both combine to produce a film that is ""OK"" and is about as good as it is fair to expect given the subject matter and the approach.<br/><br/>In terms of DVD sales, the film now has its ""nominated for Oscar"" heading for the cover although I half agree with Freeman in his summation of winning – I agree they are none. His nomination is for his character more than him because his performance is weak. His accent is OK at times and awful at others and his attempts to get Mandela via body language and the famous smile doesn't come off because both feel a little forced, like a man doing an impression. Funnily enough this is good enough for the material but it is only an ""OK"" performance. Damon is better in terms of accent and performance although he has the same material and there is only so much there for him. The cast beyond these two are solid and nobody is ""bad"" by any means. Eastwood directs in a solid and professional manner but, like the material, it is perhaps all too obvious and predictable. The only really bad aspect of the film I thought was the selection of soundtrack – the songs used are regularly either ""stock African music"" or some awful ballads designed to try and wring emotion out of the viewer when the film itself is not – I thought the music was terrible throughout and had the opposite effect of what it was aiming for.<br/><br/>I sound very negative but I did actually like Invictus – but note the choice of word in ""like"". It is good enough to ""like"" and it is good enough to quite enjoy while it is on. It falls short in all it tries to do and while it sort of does a sports movie and captures the importance of the sport it doesn't do it that well and it really fails to translate this to the audience. Solid enough to be worth a watch (you won't curse the time you spent) but not good enough to be more than a ""likeable"" film."

","This movie just worth every coin I've paid to see it. It's a perfect lesson from how to give a tribute to a great person by making a film.The footage goes further from any other Mandela's documentary, it focuses the life from an entire country and places to the audience in a very realistic sight from all the white-black hate called Apartheid that Southafrica have been through. The film gives a great lesson, there's no better way to change things than doing it by the example. Mandela lost almost 40% from his life on behalf of his nation, let's not forgive that ever. I think Morgan Freeman's acting was just the way everybody always expects from him, at the same time his character in this film reminds me his great job in ""Shawshank Redemption"", doing almost the same part,I mean, a person who even in jail never thought as a criminal. Although, the movie was a good way to promote the next FIFA World Cup in Southafrica y Coca Cola."
"Eumenides_0","7","1","2","3 February 2010"," The Inspirational Movie of 2009
","Invictus shows Hollywood doing what it does best: inspiring true stories. These days I don't expect much from Hollywood. But at least Hollywood hasn't yet lost its touch to inspire and leave the viewer upbeat. Invictus works very well as a movie so long as the viewer comes prepared to leave feeling hopeful, inspired and cheerful about life.<br/><br/>Invictus is a completely traditional piece of film-making. Every angle is predictable; the storyline develops the way we expect. Every character changes in a predictable direction, the movie even ends without surprise – in triumph, of course, as befits an inspiring true story.<br/><br/>As much as I love Clint Eastwood, he's nothing more than a good director of little dramas. He'll never set cinema on fire like Polanski or Scorsese. But that also means that there's probably no one better suited than him to direct a story about Nelson Mandela, a man who has been inspiring people for decades.<br/><br/>Invictus shows us Mandela taking charge of the South African presidency after decades in jail. His country is a mess in just about every sense. One of the problems he has to deal with is the social division between whites and blacks. Democracy may have prevailed, but you don't change decades of racial conflicts and prejudice with laws. So whites and blacks continue to hate each other. A point of conflict between the two groups is the rugby team Springboks, which during Apartheid was a symbol of white supremacy. Now the blacks want to end the team, but Mandela sees in it a way to unite the country. His idea is to use the Springboks to win the Rugby World Cup in order to bring the country together in celebration.<br/><br/>This is an interesting portrayal of Mandela, showing him as a political manipulator, although for benevolent reasons. He's no fool and he realises that the whites, though a minority, still own most of the country's economy. Also they love the Springboks. So it wouldn't be too intelligent to end the team. I for one wish the movie had continue in this morally ambiguous line, but this is an inspiring true story after all, and there's nothing more dispiriting in our times than politics.<br/><br/>What we have are inspiring speeches and many exciting rugby matches, and wide shots of crowds celebrating, all the way to its predictable conclusion. And I won't deny I didn't remain inspired and hopeful and optimistic and radiant for a few hours after watching Invictus. And then I remembered South Africa is today considered one of the most dangerous places on Earth.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman shines as Nelson Mandela and I don't think anyone deserves the Oscar for Best Actor more than him. He doesn't just capture Mandela's accent but also his mannerisms; watching Freeman was like watching Mandela at times. I don't have any idea who François Pienaar is or looks like, but I loved Matt Damon's performance too. Whether he was faithful or not, I honestly I couldn't care since I loved every scene he was in it. Kyle Eastwood's score was pretty good, but not as good as the ones he made for Letters of Iwo Jima and Gran Torino. These are scores I enjoy listening once in a while, but the one for Invictus I feel only works in the context of the movie, especially in the rugby scenes.<br/><br/>Invictus was one of my favourite movies of 2009, it's a lovely drama conscious of its purpose and limitations and thankfully doesn't try to rise above them."
"qprmal","9","1","2","1 February 2010"," I can't say anything bad about Clint. He's a living LEGEND! So let's all praise him whist he's alive.
","I've always admired Clint Eastwood's work as Actor & Director from the Spaghetti Westerns to Gran Torino. I will ignore the few dodgy movies in between (especially the one's with the chimp). But overall he's got better with age in his acting but more especially with his directing. Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino are testament to this. Invictus was surely a big project for him to take on, because it was outside the USA and involved a sport called Rugby?? I reckon Clint did a great job in showing the racism between both blacks & whites without going over the top. But I'm sure there will be S.Africans who will not agree with the entire story told and Rugby fans who cannot relate to some of the ridiculous rugby scenes. But who cares? Who else would take on such a task like Clint? He's still breaking barriers with racism at his age when he could easily take the easy route of being a Hollywood star. I don't know where he still gets the motivation and energy from at his age to do it. But he sure knows how to drain every emotion from the cinema goer with superb acting, storyline & soundtrack. Morgan Freeman and Clint must be definitely up for the Oscars."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","14 January 2010"," ""I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul""
","If I were to summarize this inspiring movie into two themes, one is the title poem by William Ernest Henley, a piece of work on courage in adversity, crystallising Nelson Mandela's life. The summary line, the last two lines of the poem, is the recurring motif that signs off the movie at its conclusion. The other theme will be immediately clear to those who have seen a movie called ""Das Wunder von Bern"" (2003) about how long a way a soccer game went in uplifting the spirit of post-WWII Germany. Post-apartheid South Africa is of course an entirely different situation, but the use of a sports event to foster national spirit is the same.<br/><br/>Those who have been following Clint Eastwood as a director should be familiar with his style of a steady hand and unassuming narration. The establishing scenes start with Nelson Mandela's (Morgan Freeman, a portrayal that has been expected for over 10 years) release after 3 decades' imprisonment and then attainment of presidency in post-apartheid Africa. The backdrop of understandable political instability is efficiently painted, through various scenes such as the undercurrent of complicated emotions between his two loyal and efficient security chiefs: one black, the other white.<br/><br/>The main plot line is soon brought to the forefront when Mandela asks to tea Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon), captain of the struggling Springbok national rugby team that is considered by many to be the symbol of apartheid. With vision and foresight, Mandela sees this as an opportunity to bring together Afrikaners and Africans in a common national course, the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The story tells how Mandela inspires Pienaar, who in turn inspires his team to win match after match against all odds, culminating in an underdog semi-final against the formidable New Zealand team.<br/><br/>The triple Golden Globe nomination for Eastwood (director), Freeman (lead actor) and Demon (supporting actor) says all. I hope that at least one of them gets the prestigious award, if not all three."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","3 January 2010"," An amazing journey to touch everyone's heart
","This film is about Nelson Mandela and his ques to unit his country with an unconventional but winning method.<br/><br/>""Invictus"" is astounding. Through an excellent plot and strong story telling, it is very engaging throughout the entire film. The first half of the film focuses on the devastating effects of racial segregation, and I am happy to see the changes of these people shown at the end. It feels like no loose ends are left, every single scene in the beginning is catered for at the end. And I do not recall any sports scene that grabs my attention like the final scene, as if I was experiencing the match passionately in the venue. Only Clint Eastwood can make a rugby match last for 30 minutes and make it suspenseful all the way. Even the minutes of cheering at the end does not feel a bore, bu help to consolidate the mighty high emotions. I am very touched by the ending, as it is so well made. Sound and visual effects all help to lift viewers' spirits to the highest level. Clint Eastwood excels again at making and uplifting and touching drama."

","Clint Eastwood delivers another great work. Morgan Freeman fit the part so well. But I believe two things made the movie great. Matt Damon is the first. I believe he performed at a deeper level than anything he has done, including Private Ryan or Will Hunting. The other was the setting and cinematography of it. I felt like I was really in South Africa, and experiencing the tension as well as the concealed hope of the situation. The weakest part was the music. The score was fine, but at several points music with lyrics distracted. African music was uplifting; but modern songs detracted from what was taking place.<br/><br/>This wasn't really a family movie, nor a sports story (although it would be good to learn a few rules of rugby if you aren't familiar with the sport). It was a true story of hurt, anger, forgiveness, and hope. ""I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul."""

","If this film were a woman, they would describe her as sturdy. It's a solid movie but nothing extraordinary. Of course the acting is top level and Clint Eastwood's direction is solid but the story itself is straightforward and often bland. Containing no plot turns or twists and surprisingly very little emotion, it's worthwhile even though it's toothless. It was a good idea to avoid covering the sport of rugby in depth because the goofy nature of the sport is a turn off to most. They focused on the impact of the sport itself and that's what saves this film. Again, it's middle of the road delivering nothing bad but falling way below greatness."
"dredyoung","10","1","2","15 December 2009"," Invictus and Mandela the Man
","""Invictus"", the Movie and the Man Mandela By Edwin L. Young, PhD December 14, 2009<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's Weltanschauungen is pure Americana. From the Wild West gunslingers to the on-the-outs lawman to macho modern women to global battlefields and finally to reformation in a third world nation, Eastwood's fame has been established on indomitable hero and heroine characters fighting against insurmountable odds and winning. His movies are all of a type one could call the ""invictus"" type and seem almost to be an extension of what I would presume to label as his own, but not idiosyncratic, 'invictus' type of personality. Eastwood's finesse as a director justly earns him the appellation of one of the greats among movie directors. Yet, with respect to those American-ish accolades, I must retract from the consensus that he is well deserved of being worshiped as a hero in the cinematic world. I must make a case that warrants my detraction from his halo awarded by the film critics, and even me. I strongly suspect that he is a true believer in his version of this pure Americana Weltanschauungen. Unfortunately, and I am sure unwittingly, this thematic schema underlying his work is aiding in perpetuating a broader cultural motif. While seemingly a hallmark of inimitably strong and laudable characters and his own character as well, this pattern in his movies is actually a prominent yet unacknowledged source of America(n)'s proclivity for using violence to deal with conflicts with those who are considered unsavory and misguided antagonists within our nation. Ironically, the same characteristic which is considered worthy of being emulated for the good of the country is, nevertheless, one that contributes to fostering those very same conflicts which presumably is his intention is to put to an end. Paradoxically, ""Invictus"" is an exception to his themes. It simultaneously proves and disproves a justification for his upholding of his devotion to this macho cultural motif. Surely this movie is a glowing example of that indomitable will with head bloodied but unbowed. On the other hand, Mandela himself, and Mandela's political strategy is the most telling example of a diametrically opposite belief system about what true human greatness is and what the most effective means are for dealing with those who are considered ideologically oppositional, unsavory, misguided antagonists, and enemies, both within his, and our nation, and abroad. Mandela, an internationally famous yet solitary 'consensus of one' within his fiercely divided nation with its formerly mutually violent and now mutually suspicious and antipathetic parties, stands as the turning point, as a pivotal force, for future world history. What was Mandela's strategy and why was he successful in stemming the tide of national, mutual animosity between Africans and Afrikaners? He used two things. First he used the management strategy of interlocking objectives. What this means is that two camps can be, in this case, made to feel that the success and well-being of each depends upon each striving to make sure the other reaches their goal successfully. Second he took on a challenge to make a national symbol, South Africa's Rugby team, the winner of the international tournament. At the beginning they were considered the dark horse. His victorious election to the presidency of South Africa after having been imprisoned for thirty years by the Afrikaners made him a folk hero of monumental proportions to the blacks and an awesome figure to be feared and reviled, but secretly revered, by the losing Afrikaners. So, when he sent for the Captain of the Rugby team to join him in the quest, against all odds, to win the world cup and had them shown on national TV, with the whole nation watching, he put in progress a plan to unite the nation in supporting its team in their determination to win. His public appearances, drawing attention to their county's ambitions for their Rugby team preceding the tournament, began to make the nation see him as championing the cause of all South Africans. Interlocking objectives! Both sides were gradually induced to work for a success that would be their mutual victory and, in the end, to him see as the leader favoring, not one side, not just the blacks, but all South Africans. His character, forged into iron from his early days as a political activist, was further forged into steel while in prison as he read the great books of the world and observed and studied the Afrikaner guards. One major factor not mentioned in the movie was that it was F. W. de Klerk, the last President of the apartheid South African State, who brought him those books over all of those years. I speculate that de Klerk did much more than just bring him books. Mandela read and thought while imprisoned, in an environment sealed off from the immediate pressures that make men small-minded, grew into a highly educated, highly independent, deep and deeply universalistic thinker and planner. What I see in all of this is his abdication of the belief in the cult of the individual. The cult of the individual essentially is the message behind the message in the poem ""Invictus."" Notwithstanding the invictus message, Mandela now had a new assumption and a new understanding of the encompassing nature of structures and systems. He eventually saw how the system, of racially antipathetic, politically opposing parties, was intertwined with a multitude of other, mutually influencing and sustaining, systems. Further, he eventually saw that there were fulcrums within those systems which others may not see but which could be used to alter them, from the most encompassing at the state and even international level, to the interactions between former antagonists, and ultimately alter even the character, personalities, and behavior of all individual citizens. This is the meaning of a true, great statesman! One who understands how he and all people are shaped by the structures and systems within which they exist and then turns that around to reshape those very same structures and systems for the greater good."
"abitahooey","7","1","2","14 December 2009"," Amazing performances, meh film
","This was a classic case of a film trying to do way too much. Things were skimmed, characters were left undeveloped, and the rugby (or so I'm told by people who know what they're talking about) was not very good.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is this film tried to skim over two incredibly interesting stories that are connected but not completely interrelated, and tried to make them one. On one hand, there is the South African rugby team, who rises to success to become world cup champions against incredible odds. Yet their victory is not explained or really explored at all besides having Nelson Mandela ask them to do win. On the other hand, there is Nelson Mandela, an interesting leader who decides to do everything in his government completely differently which includes attempting to unite people on severely opposing sides of an issue, sacrificing his family and his health in the process, but Mandela's problems are also barely touched on.<br/><br/>I give this film a seven, because despite some obvious weaknesses, it also has some great strengths. Morgan Freeman is absolutely fantastic. Every scene centered around him, and the political aspects of the story seems perfectly set, but that makes moments with the rugby team seem tacked on, especially considering that this is supposedly a story about a team that tries to bring its country together. The team seems to just come together and win, without any explanation and any opportunity for them to show their ""togetherness"" on-screen. Particularly disappointing was the fact that Matt Damon's character was really given nothing to do. Damon does his best, which considering what a wonderful actor he is, is a lot, but that just never takes off. I'd recommend seeing it, but I'd recommend waiting for the DVD."

And not to mention more white directors. And they are searching hi and low 2 find the white Tarzan in every African victory.<br/><br/>Film is an art but I get concerned when every film out of SA sings the same theme.

When did we see a film where whites didn't exist? <br/><br/>Name a ""Black film"" and look behind the lens; who wrote it, who produced it, who directed it? Amistad , the music by John Williams, the director Mr. Spielberg. A Jamaican film called One Love , again the same pattern. Tsosti a story of violence in the African communities, violence is a natural reality of South African people in European perception; it sells and it feeds their image of us of being gang bangers, and semi-noble savages . It is almost impossible to consider a film that does not include a European central figure. War Dance, singing dancing through the horrors of a genocide. The recent Last King of Scotland reflects this it is in the legacy of CRY FREEDOM, the title shows the mindset behind it . I t would not be sufficient to tell the story of Idi Amin; so infamous enough and surely notorious enough character in his own right. No, they say, this would reduce the value of the project, in comes the European into the storyline. It is actually amazing to see Mel Gibson attempt to make a film of a non-White people without a central European character. Returning to the likes of Richard Attenborough we cannot blame him for his bias in Cry Freedom , he is by nature a European and is simply acting out his European weighted world view, avoiding Eurocentric as a term, as every healthy race is sensitive to his or her cultural perceptions"
"jacobolson-621-351752","3","1","3","7 November 2019"," Unworthy of it's merits
","Frankly, this movie gets far too much credit. It's a movie about Nelson Mandela though, and Morgan Freeman plays him. So yeah, people are going to say they like it. Myself on the other hand, well, I turned it off halfway through. The story telling is muddled and confused, for the first hour all I could think was, what is this movie even about? What exactly is the plot here, and where is the character development? Is it about Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest peace makers of our time, or the rugby team he worked with?<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes are exposition, where nothing happens to any of the characters on screen. There's no moment of emotional impact on any characters in the cast for the first 40 minutes. The only information we receive for the first half is in the form of expositional dialog, characters saying, ""The Spring Bucks are a sign of racial inequality. You can't break bread with them. I don't like you because your people are mean. Yada yada."" But we as the audience only ever see the genuine inequality of the sport once, in the opening shot. And it's not the Spring Bucks being shown. We never see any direct discrimination from Caucasians at all, honestly. It's weird.<br/><br/>Aside from the rugby arc, we glimpse more deeply into Nelson Mandela himself. But these moments are short, and never focus on the subject at hand. The scenes don't link together properly, each one reiterating what we have already heard, or referring to something irrelevant. We spend more time on Mandela's body guards than could ever be necessary, when almost no time is spent on his work outside of his rugby centric social outreach.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the sound track, my god it is appalling. There's this constant attempt to cause conflict where there doesn't need to be any. Body guards getting anxious about assassination, crowds booing Mandela out of arenas. But the music doesn't follow. The song at 1:07 is what forced my hand, I had to end it. It was then and there, that I slayed my own vessel to the abhorrent sounds of Colorblind, by Overtone.

It's not a terrible song, I don't like it, but it's cool if you do. However, to play this after a speech from NeLsON MAnDeLA, OOOOoo boy that really shirks my gherken.
Ok that's it, I'm out.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, one thing though. It is cool that this is a movie set in South Africa, for that, I am glad it was made. Solely for that reason though, am I ok with its existence. For that, I give it 3 stars. But that's it, for all the talent that went into this movie, it honestly deserves a 1...

"zkonedog","6","1","3","12 March 2017"," Don't Expect Past Eastwood Greatness...But Still Okay
","Whenever I see the name ""Clint Eastwood"" associated with a new moving coming to theaters, I automatically think of such incredible films as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, and Gran Torino. Perhaps I am just spoiled by Eastwood's spotless track record, but that is the reality of the situation. With that in mind, Invictus does not live up to the billing...but it still is a very honorable effort.<br/><br/>Basically, the film takes place primarily in the country of South Africa, where Nelson Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freeman) has come to power and is striving to bridge the gap between blacks and whites after decades of apartheid rule. Mandela seizes upon the country's terrible rugby team, stocked primarily by high-brow, burly white men, as a symbol of unity for the country. He tabs Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to captain the team and make them respectable (if not a whole lot more) heading into the World Cup. The rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>Now, I can't say that this film was outright bad in any way. The race-relations message is one that resonates, the rugby team is certainly inspirational, and the acting is pretty good as well, led by the remarkable Freeman as one of the world's most storied leaders. Yet, unlike ""Torino"" or ""Baby"", the word I would use to describe this film is ""understated"". Instead of walloping viewers over the head with such heavy topics as euthanasia, religion, or death, in this effort Eastwood takes a much more low-key approach. There is drama, yes, and plenty of inspiration, but it just doesn't feel as epic as it could have been. Whether this was Eastwood trying to ""follow the facts"" as much as possible, or the real-life story just not providing the high drama of a fully scripted film, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Thus, if you are heading to the theater expecting utter greatness like I was, you will likely leave disappointed. However, if the topics/events/times in the film are of significant personal or cultural importance to you, then Invictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired."
"fastd03","5","1","3","2 January 2017"," A shell of what this movie had the potential to become
","The movie takes on the challenge of the complex story of the role of rugby in unifying the new, post-apartheid South Africa, and is interesting overall. It fails, however, to approach the potential of the actual story. The production comes across as a collection of snippets thrown together more than a cohesive story. Furthermore, the progression of popular black South African emotions towards the team, from hatred to approval and adoration, is poorly developed - and as a result seems somewhat false. This movie comes across as more of a feel good movie about post-apartheid unification in South Africa than the more thoughtful analysis of how this sport was used as a symbol/tool for unification in a nation on the brink of civil war due to a very recent and complex history of racial separation/terror."

"Deanjones1970","9","1","3","12 December 2012"," Clint Eastwoork and Morgan Freeman at their best.
","Another great movie by Clint Eastwood and acted inspirationally by Morgan Freeman as Mandela. Morgan has always seemed to play supporting roles still at a great level and seeing him finally play a Starting role and runs with it. Its hard to imagine that this role the fits like a glove to Morgan Freeman did not get him the Oscar that he has deserved for so long. Its amazing to see a movie about this man be made that seemed to preach about forgiveness and someone who reached across the aisle to unite a divided country. While his election caused a lot of unrest among the ruling whites and the years worth of oppression. With his wisdom he knew that the Rugby team could cause more unrest if it were to be ended, so he instead choose to challenge the captain to win the world cup and unite the whole country. The whole message for forgiveness, unity and persistence make this a movie to see. The relationships created weather with the black and white security detail, the team reaching out to the communities to teach them how to play was a testament to Mandela and his leadership. The way Mandela used the sport of rugby to unite a nation and the way Eastwood also showed this was a very emotional and delightful message that people should be cheering for. In one of his more straight forward works of his career Clint has accomplished one of his most inspirational films in Invictus. Everything in the movie worked on so many degrees of art without being too exaggerated and egotistical it only asks of you to have a open mind and heart. The way Eastwood uses his skills to direct the film so perfectly and to lay back directing when he needs to with out pushing the subject matter too much in our faces. In a time when neighboring countries replaced that white power base that ended up with more self serving regimes whose power was maintained by seizing assets of the former white citizens, that were also replaced with friends being placed into positions of power. These countries then resulted into a land of squalor and destitution. He was then treated with a lack of confidence raising question on how he will be any different. The film was Mandela but the rugby team was his symbol of what he faced that the Africans rooted for the other teams because of apartheid and division between all the races. With his focus and determination the symbol of division would be revived to be the catalyst to unite all South Africans. We may all like a feel food under dog story which this was but this was a much more touching film that is more about people coming together to rebuild their country. With so many great moments and a little romanticized bit of history, this will be something you enjoy and stays with you after the movie is over. He did not solve all the problems of the country but he helped create the foundation for a unification and to improve and grow."
"phd_travel","3","1","3","28 July 2010"," well intentioned but miscast
","From a historical point of view it is interesting to see the transition of power from the white to black. But in the end it doesn't quite show how a mostly white rugby team winning a game helped to unify the country as a whole. The game just looks trivial compared to the problems of the country as a whole. Also the screenplay is simplistic in that Mandela's wisdom and saintliness is exaggerated here. He is unrealistically good here. <br/><br/>Clint's direction is as usual a little indulgent. The game at the end is too long. <br/><br/>Miscasting is the worst fault of this movie. Morgan Freeman's accent isn't that good - in fact it distracts from the movie. Maybe they could have found an African actor for the part. Matt Damon's accent is better but he is too small sized for a rugby player - it looks like they are trying to make him look bigger by using camera angles etc but it doesn't work."
"agsconnolly","6","1","3","27 July 2010"," A fumble from Eastwood, but this scrapes over the line.
","Before I watched Invictus, I'd never seen a bad Clint Eastwood film. And having seen it, I still haven't. But although Invictus is not actually a bad film, I couldn't help but feel that Eastwood dropped the ball slightly here (if you'll pardon the pun). The temptation to make a film about someone as iconic as Nelson Mandela must have been huge, and to tie it in with a rousing story of sporting courage against the odds was likely to be a successful formula. And for the most part, it is.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was born to play Nelson Mandela, and he does it here superbly. Freeman has presence of almost mythical stature, like Mandela himself, which is clear on-screen. In fact, you could almost be watching a film about Morgan Freeman – and I mean that in a positive way. Due to the premise of the film, the role of the South African captain, Francois Pienaar, is key and needed to be played by a top actor, which is why Matt Damon was cast. However, Damon's presence inadvertently causes one of the main downsides to the film, which is the actual rugby action. Due to his size, pretty much all the other protagonists are pretty short themselves, making the games look pretty odd. Anyone who has watched international rugby will note that every team has players, barring perhaps two or three, over six feet tall and in a few cases closer to seven feet. This size issue, and the fact that most of the players simply don't look like international sportsmen, takes away from the realism of the rugby scenes.<br/><br/>It is pretty clear that Clint Eastwood was not a rugby fan when he began making this film. The climactic scenes of the World Cup final are actually a bit of a mess and could be confusing to someone not familiar with the game. I guess we have to remember that the majority of people watching this film (i.e. largely Americans) will not know a great deal about the game of rugby and will not notice most of the inaccuracies. But for someone who does know the game, the genuine footage shown of Jonah Lomu tearing through the England defence in the semi-final somewhat shows up the choreographed play elsewhere in the film. Oh, and let's not get started on the frankly ridiculous CGI crowd, which looks no more real than it would in a video game.<br/><br/>Generally, the film has some really good performances. Damon is solid as Pienaar, even if his physical presence (or lack thereof) is distracting. Freeman is excellent, and some of the incidental characters are good also, even if they are somewhat formulaically scripted. The film hits all the notes you would expect it to, which is pleasing to the viewer, but never really challenges or surprises. Ultimately, this film probably unfolds exactly the way you would expect it to. The country is divided, Mandela steps in, the rugby team are victorious and everyone is united. It's nothing particularly unsatisfactory; it's just not very exciting.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I think Freeman may have been better off sticking with his plan for a full Mandela biopic. But either way, we have the performance we hoped for from Freeman in this role, and that's as good a reason as any to give this film a chance. Rugby fans may just have to exercise some suspension of disbelief."
"bodemiller","4","1","3","27 February 2010"," Disappointing
","Going in I thought this was going to be terrific - great actors, great story, great director - what's not to like? As it turns out, plenty. Aside from a fine performance by Morgan Freeman, this movie is a stinker. Simplistic script, no real story, and of course we know in advance how it all turns out. Acting is very flat (except Freeman) and the rugby match scenes go on forever. I love rugby and played in college, but this stuff was awful. The on-pitch rugby action doesn't begin to capture what world cup rugby looks like or even a college game for that matter. I'm doubly disappointed because I love Clint Eastwood's direction generally. I still can't believe he made this film. Seemed very amateurish to me. If you must see this movie because you like Morgan Freeman, get it on DVD when it comes out."
"w_ooza","6","1","3","25 January 2010"," A film that aims for an ambitious goal but skews the kick wide of the mark
","Whilst being a decent film, the main problem with Invictus is that, unlike many sports films that have come before it, it doesn't focus just on the sport or the sporting-related drama. It tries to bring together Mandela's election victory, the man himself and the inspiration he found in prison through the poem the film is named after, the state of apartheid and class in South Africa at the time, as well as the events of the rugby tournament without really concentrating enough on any of the individual elements. It is, in other words, the film equivalent of gathering too many eggs into the one basket or, if you will, a film which tries to tackle much more than it can really handle.<br/><br/>Invictus does have its moments. Morgan Freeman is excellent and the character of Mandela is portrayed affectionately and sensibly with hints of his humanity, humour, and his own family problems amidst the enormity of the task he faced. There is a nice scene where the Springboks spend a day with soccer-loving children in a poor community and the only black player on the team is mobbed. But sadly the story suffers mainly through the lack of any strong leading characters apart from Mandela: Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar who, as the team captain and the main focus on the sporting aspect of the film, is at the end of the day just a rugby player after all, and whilst there are supporting characters in the form of Mandela's bodyguards and personal assistants while New Zealand's Jonah Lomu is represented as the closest ""bad guy"" character to be found in the movie, none of them are explored enough to make the event feel as significant as it ought to have been. The rest of the cast act only as a means of connecting the few major characters together – the Springboks team in particular have very little to offer apart from uttering filler- speak and nodding their heads in agreement or shaking them in disapproval - and Pienaar's and Mandela's families contribute only in speaking minor lines of exposition and shouting in excitement at the final whistle.<br/><br/>The fairytale simply works better as a moment in history documented through word and memory than as a film, which is surprising given that, even without any liberties taken with the actual facts of the tournament as demonstrated in many of the other movies in the genre where last minute goals or touchdowns or home runs or three pointers are scored, the Springbok's did really win the World Cup as underdogs and they did actually score a last minute drop goal in extra time in the Final and yet none of this hits home as anything remotely exciting. Unfortunately Eastwood has a deliberately slow style which is simply not suited to a story of Mandela as well as a story about a sporting miracle at the same time, when clearly he does not know how to capture the excitement of sport never mind a code of football alien and peculiar to many Americans and the mainstream audience granted how scrum shots are over-elaborated on and drop goals are excruciatingly slow-mo'd. As to the bigger question of whether South Africa's problems improved as a result of the team's victory, the film teases you by alluding to it through a close-up of black and white hands on the trophy and spliced-together footage of a celebrating nation but does not expand on what happened next, and what we are left with is an attempt at capturing the state of a country during a single sporting moment when the moment is better felt and experienced and almost impossible to truly capture on screen.<br/><br/>It is by no means a terrible film. Certainly nowhere near as awful or as ridiculous as my favourite bad sports movie Victory/Escape to Victory – starring Michael Caine, Sylvester Stallone, members of the England 1966 World Cup (soccer) winning squad, where English and American prisoners of war in WWII (plus Pele) play the Nazis and win not only the final match but also their freedom. There is however a perplexing and inappropriate scene in Invictus near the end where a South African Airlines plane flies over the stadium to insinuate an act of terror which has no place whatsoever in this movie. Ultimately though we are merely left with a Mandela film which would have been better had it just focused on Nelson Mandela and where the rugby didn't get in the way, or otherwise a rugby story better left as perhaps a feature article or a story told in a pub or in a school PE class. Fans of the sport and those interested in the former South African president will likely be left disappointed with a final product akin to that of Ang Lee directing Hulk; a talented director better suited to emotional pieces taking on a project that aims for an ambitious goal but skews the kick wide of the mark."
"3xHCCH","6","1","3","9 January 2010"," That Rousing Second Half is Well Worth the Long Wait
","Running for over two hours, this film really felt long especially at the beginning. You really need patience to watch this movie. The first 45 minutes about various political meetings was so boring I almost gave up! Not even Morgan Freeman's uncanny portrayal of Pres. Nelson Mandela was enough. Then came that scene where Mandela met up with Springboks Captain Francois Pienaar (played by Matt Damon) to encourage them to win the Rugby World Cup in order to promote unity for the newly united South Africa. Thankfully, after that scene, the movie finally woke up and picked up the pace, and became an entertaining film.<br/><br/>As with any inspirational sports film like ""Mighty Ducks"" or ""Rocky"", you know how this would end. Yet I found the rugby scenes engrossing, even if I did not really understand all the mechanics of the game. I wish they had included more information about the game or had play-by-play of the matches for better appreciation of the action. That last match of the Springboks vs the New Zealand All Blacks was very exciting. I liked the details, like the plane that mysteriously flew above the stadium, and the Maori Haka dance of the All Blacks before the match began.<br/><br/>As director, again Clint Eastwood had his excesses, as he did in his other flawed films like ""Flag of our Fathers"" or ""Changeling"". He should have decided which film he wanted to make. The second half of the film could have stood on its own as a very good focused sports film. Too bad, Eastwood also delve lengthily on political issues in the beginning. Honestly, this movie succeeds more as an inspirational sports movie, than an inspirational political film. I must emphasize though, that rousing second half is well worth the wait."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","1","3","14 December 2009"," Standard feel-good story infused with Oscar-caliber talents
","I think there's actually a proverb somewhere that says ""On one of three things a film contends for Oscars: Clint Eastwood directing, Morgan Freeman acting and a compelling historical figure as the lead role."" The person who first uttered this saying would take one look at ""Invictus"" and say: ""well that's not fair."" But despite being predestined for Oscar glory, ""Invictus"" amounts to a simple feel-good sports and human interest story in the hands of exceptional talent.<br/><br/>The main source of antagonism in ""Invictus"" is the fear and embittered attitudes of its characters: the people (both black and white) of post-Apartheid South Africa during the beginning of Nelson Mandela's presidency in the early '90s. That might be poetic, but it's not exactly the stuff that great drama and conflict is made of. The only suspense created is by the posing of two questions: Can South Africa can win the rugby world cup and can it begin mend and rebuild itself under Mandela's wise guidance? Interesting, but not exactly riveting stuff for a two-hour and 14-minute film.<br/><br/>Still, Clint Eastwood directs the heck out of this only slightly compelling script by Anthony Peckham based on the John Carlin book. Eastwood turns the mild events of the film into microcosms of racial discord. He creates similar black and white imagery to echo these intentions too. Mandela's security staff are the best example. At first Mandela's black guards are furious they have to work with white men, but we watch them grow closer and Eastwood slides images of the guards traveling in cars by race at one point then showing them mixed toward the end. Subtle and effective, this milks the story for all it's worth.<br/><br/>You also won't find an inspirational sports story that manages to avoid cliché better than ""Invictus."" Eastwood keeps the focus on the people and the symbolic meaning of rugby while still bringing us into the action. There aren't any banal last chances, miracle plays or excessive celebrations. Some of those techniques are used, but you won't roll your eyes at ""Invictus"" and you'll truly understand what the cup meant to South Africa.<br/><br/>Freeman and Matt Damon as South Africa rugby captain Francois Pienaar are two other towering forces working to add depth and emotion to the film. After this fall's ""The Informant!"" Damon continues to impress with his versatility. The combination of tough-guy and emotional leader makes Pienaar a role that suits him very well. He continues to become one of the finest actors of his generation, even if this role is understated.<br/><br/>Freeman gives us as much as he can muster in a script that drastically undercuts his complexity. Needless to say, however, the role is indeed perfect for him. He gives us hints of inner tensions and personal problems along with the colorful personality and pristinely delivered inspirational quotes. It's important to note this is not a biopic of Mandela, but a brief history of what times were like when he came into office and how he saw rugby as a way to erase the cycle of hate and unify his country.<br/><br/>Although it starts to burden its audience with a lot of rugby footage toward the end, ""Invictus"" is an excellent feel-good movie. Where it falls short is in being constantly engaging and complex. Having a triumvirate of Oscar-caliber talents in this case is more an instance of putting forth the maximum effort to lift a pleasant story as high as possible. As producer, Eastwood saw a lot of likable stuff in this story and he made it better than anyone else would have. Palate-wise, ""Invictus"" is like glorified homemade cooking as opposed to the layers and intricacies of gourmet.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

I coach and play rugby in America and I think the rugby scenes were horrific. Clint should have used real athletes for the rugby scenes, not actors. None of the Samoen team even looked Polynesian. They all looked like wimps. The movie made it seem like dropkicks are a big part of the game. They in fact are very rare. I am glad that rugby is shown in the USA because it is so unknown here. Beyond the rugby footage, the movie was very well done. I am currently reading Mandela's autobiography and it gives great insights to his character and motivations. He is truly a great man and I was glad he was portrayed by such a great actor as Morgan Freeman."

","I'll be honest, I didn't really know who Nelson Mandella was before this film came out, but when I saw Invictus, I saw the story of a man that is unlike any other in modern history.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, refuses to be your typical biopic, and that is where it is most charming. Rather than giving you the typical play-by-play analysis of Mandella's life, like pretty much every single biopic ever made, Eastwood simply took a small slice of Mandella's long and illustrious career, and put it to the big screen.<br/><br/>The film picks up right when Mandella is elected President of South Africa. The film essentially follows his first year or two in office as he rallies together with the Captain of the South African Rugby team to try and unite the country, which is split between black and white, by winning the Rugby World Cup. But how can the Rugby team win, when they're utterly horrendous? That is all one needs to know to see Invictus, and if you have any knowledge of modern history (which unfortunately mine is very limited), then you probably know what is going to happen, but it's the journey there that makes Invictus worth watching.<br/><br/>Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham should be applauded for giving the audience a full summation of who Mandella is and what he's like, all without doing this long and boring backstory, they just jump straight into the meat of the story and capture the audience from the very beginning. Though, this film isn't just a biopic, it's a sports film as well.<br/><br/>Eastwood and Peckham have managed to craft a sports film unlike any other I think I've ever seen, tossing aside all of the typical sports movie conventions. They do not overplay any of the rugby matches, they simply show them as if you were a player running on the field along with the two opposing teams, which in the end is more naturalistic, but I can't help but feel it keeps the film from reaching the emotional heights of some other sports films. Plus, it's the first film I've ever seen to feature rugby, and I just wonder, does anyone in America truly understand this sport?<br/><br/>With all that said, the film features terrific performances from all the stars. Matt Damon shines as the Captain of the South African Rugby team. Damon disappears into this role, and while I don't know if it has enough meat to garner him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod, he should not be forgotten. Speaking of Oscars, Morgan Freeman is the heart-and-soul of this film as Nelson Mandella. Freeman is, in my opinion, a shoe- in for Best Actor, he simply disappears into this role and he comes across as confident, wise, and charming all at the same time.<br/><br/>At the end of Invictus, you leave feeling satisfied and uplifted, but the only thing this movie lacked was that big emotional moment of catharsis. Perhaps I'm too sentimental to enjoy a movie that denies the audience that big, weeper moment? Even without it, Invictus shines as a beautiful piece of filmmaking, being an entertaining film that defies convention and manages to uplift the soul while at it.<br/><br/>I give Invictus an 8 out of 10!"
"deltajvliet","9","1","3","11 December 2009"," An Important Film
","It's interesting how well Eastwood balances political prisoner turned president Nelson Mandela with, of all things, rugby in his latest masterpiece. The biopic chronicles Mandela's rise to power and his efforts to unite South Africans, black and white alike, behind the national rugby team. It wasn't a political calculation, it was a human one. <br/><br/>Freeman absolutely disappears into his role as the iconic leader of post-Apartheid South Africa. This is an especially impressive feat for such a well known actor; it's not Morgan Freeman we're watching, it's Mandela. Damon does a good job as well. And while I'm no expert on accents, both sounded convincing to me. <br/><br/>The story is inspiring, absolutely inspiring. It's 1994, and blacks are granted the right to vote; Mandela is swept into office. Blacks are ecstatic, whites are fearful. How does Mandela overcome the hateful rift within the population? Rugby, of course. Mandela figures that if the South African rugby team can win the World Cup, the country will have something to rally behind as one. <br/><br/>What makes Invictus truly great is the universal truth found within its story. Sure, the end of Apartheid and South Africa's bright looking future make for a compelling story, but why stop there when you can make a powerful statement on what can be accomplished when hate, oppression, and violence end and peace begins. It works wonderfully in the context of the story between black and white, but it could be applied to Bosnian and Serb, Muslim and Jew, Catholic and Protestant, Hutu and Tutsi... <br/><br/>Eastwood is on a roll. He's 79, but by God he's just getting started. The man has given us Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Changeling, Gran Torino, and now Invictus all within six years; five of these movies are on the Top 250, and I have absolute confidence Invictus will make it six. <br/><br/>9/10"

","Because of his recent death, we decided it would be fit for us to try and honour the memory of Nelson Mandela by reviewing one of the many movies about his life. Even though there is much controversy surrounding his life and actions (great people are rarely not controversial), the majority of people still consider him an icon, a great politician and an extremely important figure in South African history. Invictus depicts Mandela's life after being released from prison, but since showing all the things he had done while president of South Africa would be impossible and make the movie a mess, it was decided to concentrate the story on the South African rugby team.<br/><br/>After spending 27 years in prison for sabotage and conspiracy, and finally being released, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is chosen as the president of South Africa. His mission is extremely difficult: to end apartheid and unite the people. He sees his opportunity in the South African rugby team, the Springboks, which is losing all of its games. As the team is a symbol of oppression (only white people cheer for it), the Sports Commission wants to change its colors and name. Mandela, unexpectedly, decides to back up the Springboks and opposes this decision: he doesn't want Afrikaners to believe Mandela wants to rid South Africa of their presence. He wants the nation to feel as one again by cheering for the same team.<br/><br/>A lot of research and hard work was put into this movie: Clint Eastwood, the director, started watching so much rugby for the movie he ended up being a fan, Matt Damon interviewed Francois Pienaar and trained rugby, and Freeman, who had been Mandela's friend for many years, went to South Africa to get his blessing for the movie - which he gained. Unfortunately, the movie didn't turn out to be as good as one would expect. One thing that bothered me is that, no matter what a great job Freeman did and the effort and hard work he put in preparing his role, I could rarely 'feel' Mandela - it was just Freeman acting, though masterfully. Moreover, I felt the movie was too long and got tedious from time to time, especially when showing teams playing rugby: I know that's what the movie is about, but it could have been made more interesting, especially for people who don't understand the game.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I thought it was an excellent decision to show how the relationships between black and white members of Mandela's security staff develop: Mandela forces them to work together and overcome their animosities, showing that people can change and, maybe most importantly, even a small change is (and was, for Mandela) crucial. It would have been nice to see more of Matt Damon's character, but he mostly plays rugby during the movie. Still, it is somewhat understandable: this movie is, after all, about Nelson Mandela, and what a huge inspiration and powerful politician he was.

","You have to be into rugby to get this film.<br/><br/>The ubiquitous revolutionary statesman Nelson Mandela is played by the equally ubiquitous Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman: Freeman does a surprisingly talented impersonation.<br/><br/>Damon is adept at a South African English accent and as I don't know the face or voice of the former rugby star, Damon's scenes (presumably impersonating Pienaar) required less suspension of disbelief from me than those scenes involving Freeman's Mandela.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the production values are good and the match scenes would appeal to anyone who is into rugby. <br/><br/>The more serious down-side of the film is the obvious side-lining of deeper social problems that play out even today. Even the ostensibly science-fiction film 'District 9' cuts deeper.<br/><br/>Sadly, not everything in the world is solved by sport. <br/><br/>Simplistic and sometimes awkward... but great production values."
"blanbrn","8","1","4","12 December 2009"," A film that shows how becoming inspired can change a nation when you connect up with forgiveness despite racial and political tension.
","As always Clint Eastwood does such wonderful work probably better as a director than an actor. And it's no different here as Eastwood directs ""Invictus"" a good film not just of historical meaning and terms, but it's interesting how it connects with people of a once fractured country to inspire the will to be happy all thru forgiveness. This film is not just about the release of one Nelson Mandela but more of how he transforms the country thru of all things it's white rugby team.<br/><br/>Starting in 1990 when Mandela(Morgan Freeman as always is his classy and spot on best from expressions to even the cadences) is released from South African prison to a country that's still split by racial tensions and transitional violence. As for years the blacks have always had problems with the whites as the popular rugby team the Springboks are detested by the blacks. Yet Mandela thru his love and learning about forgiveness surprises his people and supports the team as this is his way to springboard the country to be more loving and compassionate.<br/><br/>The rugby team lead by captain Francois Pienaar(Matt Damon who's chemistry with Freeman is good)meets with Mandela and he becomes inspired to work harder so they can win the World Cup and prove to all South Africans that peace and love is possible for all as all of them no matter what color are the same and the team represents everyone. True this film is an inspirational one that's connected to athletics yet deep underneath it's more about the changing times of a nation lead by forgiveness and inner working of politics. The film moves along well as Eastwood paces the action field shots well as the rugby scenes are entertaining as you cheer for victory even though you know the Springboks are gonna be winners.<br/><br/>Still I really don't call this a sports movie even though it's connected to it. The film has a much more deep meaning proving that a leader can inspire a nation and change their thoughts thru a winning team as he learned forgiveness and that a nation should be one. Really good to show when inspired attitudes change hard times even like racial tensions as it's always important that cultures and things change in society. Plus with this strong performance by the class act Freeman and it's themes of nation changing, forgiveness, inspiration ""Invictus"" is one film that makes a person happy after they see it."
"jgregg42","8","1","5","11 December 2009"," Invictus' action is caught in a scrum
","Invictus (it means unconquered, I had to look it up too) is a story about Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman) and his quest to unify an apartheid-riddled South Africa through the game of rugby in the early 1990s.<br/><br/>The story begins with Mandela's release from prison. He immediately becomes elected president and immediately begins work on bringing his country together. And when I type immediately, I actually mean slowly. The movie drags along at a snail's pace for about an hour. For being a movie dealing with a vicious sport such as rugby, I was expecting it move along quickly and with a lot of brute force such as I would find in a rugby match. I forgot about scrums, which can take a while to produce any kind of action. And, this movie did exactly that.<br/><br/>The movie has some very strong moments though. One in particular was where Director Clint Eastwood took a small fraction of the people of South Africa and used them to show what was happening on a larger scale. He did this by focusing on Mandela's security detail. Mandela had rehired the old security detail (a bunch of white guys) to work with his personal bodyguards (a bunch of black guys) to protect him. Mandela used these two groups as an example of how he wanted his fellow countrymen to act. Eastwood couldn't show all 42 million South Africans having disagreements so he took eight people to tell the story of cooperation through their actions. Great job, I get it.<br/><br/>So, what about the rugby? Wasn't this supposed to be a movie about rugby? Yes, I think it was supposed to be. It was also a movie about Mandela's quest to bring people together. The rugby was used well, and not knowing enough about the sport, I wasn't totally engulfed by the action scenes. There was one scene where the South African rugby team taught impoverished youths the rules of rugby. Here I wish they had capitalized on the scene more by telling the audience what goes on in a rugby match. It wasn't until the last 20 minutes where we were finally wowed with some gritty rugby action during the 1995 World Cup.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Tough question. If I say no, I go against the Eastwood/ Freeman establishment, which I don't want to do because I think Freeman should get an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Mandela. If I say yes, I wouldn't say it enthusiastically. So I'll say this, if you want a biopic on Nelson Mandela's life, don't see this movie; and if you want a rough, in- your-face rugby movie, don't see this movie. But, if you want a little bit of both, then by all means take two hours and go see it."

","Clint Eastwood has made a string of great movies this decade, but for me Invictus isn't one of them. I don't know anything rugby about nor do I care for it. I didn't know much about Nelson Mandela either, and after watching the movie I didn't learn much about him, as the movie isn't so much about Mandela than it is about rugby. Morgan Freeman is a good choice to play Mandela, but you can still feel he's acting as his accent isn't that genuine. Matt Damon is also in the movie, but his part is nothing significant. This time Eastwood isn't starring in his own film.<br/><br/>You can skip this one unless you like rugby or you're South African."

","Invictus is based on the famous rugby finale held in South Africa in 1995. The post match presentation where Nelson Mandela presented the white springboks caotain with the trophy has become iconic and this is based on that moment. The setting and music paints an image of a bitterly divided country being gently brought together. Echos of apartheid linger and Nelson Mandela artfully turns the Springboks from a symbol of white South Africa to the team of the nation. Music and stadium scenes are quite overwhelming, while scenes of the mostly white team touring the black townships and building bonds with the children of black South Africa are heartwarming to say the least. A strong cast, including Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon. Portrayed is the the conversion of a lackluster South Africa national rugby union team to 1995 Rugby World Cup winners and focus for a reborn South Africa."

","FIFA World Cup just started providing its share of thrills, joys, and deceptions. While I was watching the Moroccan team yesterday, my right foot was uncontrollably trembling, my heart pounding at the national anthem and everyone was glued to the screen with the kind of frozen expression that that only Sports can draw on faces. <br/><br/>And tough memories resurfaced, twenty years ago, we had scored three goals against Scotland in one of ""these games""; I was tying my shoes, everyone was getting ready to celebrate our qualification to the quarter finals in the street... but Brazil that had previously beat us with three goals against none, the World Champion and team of Ronaldo (bald Ronaldo, not Cristiano) lost against Norway in what should have been an open-and-shut case. A penalty kick at the last minute destroyed all hopes. My brother cried and I took off my shoes.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, history, cruelly again, decided to repeat itself, at the last minute, in the worst possible way, one of our players scored against the team, earning Iran the precious victory and filling our hearts with bitterness. See, one can also understand the power of Sport from defeat, sport unites and brings back positive energy for a brief but exhilarating period. It also creates extraordinary bonds between people who had nothing in common except quivering for the same colors. Sports mark a truce, awakening feelings whose negative counterparts are nourished by war and political conflicts the rest of the time.<br/><br/>Sport is essential to one country; it is essential to the world. <br/><br/>And as I watched Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"" one day before the kick off, I felt like I could read in the mind of Nelson Mandela, played in all nuance and depth by Morgan Freeman. What an ironically fitting name for an African leader who was quite the opposite of a ""free man"" for ten thousand days of his life. <br/><br/>Indeed, some iconic artists achieved greatness and died in 27 years, for Mandela, it was the time spent in jail that allowed him to free his mind from hatred and resentment, to achieve his personal greatness through humility, forgiveness and humanity. The film starts at his release as he's cheerfully welcomed by black people while the whites expect the worst. ""End Apartheid"" was the slogan that the majority of today's population wouldn't remember, not even South Africans... but the miracle happened and Mandela, Madiba as he's respectfully and affectionately called, almost rhymed with Messiah. <br/><br/>""Can he run a country?"" asks a militant newspaper, Mandela's bodyguard sees a hate campaign but Madiba lucidly says ""it's a legitimate question"", he's already approaching his role as a unifier not a divider. Coming to office, he invites the skeptical whites to stay unless they think there are irreconcilable differences, what he does is giving them a choice, a freedom, a gift only a man of his experience could value. He also hires white bodyguards and their interactions with the previous team plays like a great microcosm of the reconciliation built up throughout the film, with the power of Sports. Because ""Invictus"" isn't a biography film as much as it's a Sports film.<br/><br/> Mandela has great scopes of achievements... and failures as well, his prestige was a double-edged sword that can earn him hostility from the Afrikaners and when facing unemployment, poverty, and criminality, sports could be perceived as the least of the priorities. The genius of Mandela is to take sport damn seriously, he watches a rugby game and discovers that the Blacks support any team against the Springboks, he's booed by supporters who proudly brandish the old flag and concedes it's a constitutional right. But when he learns that the ANC is going to replace the team with a new name, new colors and hymn, he asks everyone to reconsider the vote, taking time to explain why they're wrong.<br/><br/>Mandela wasn't just that all-smiling icon; like Gandhi, he was a natural-born leader. Warned by his secretary about the risk of losing his power, he reminds her that a true leader should be guided by his principles, not fears, he knows reconciliation is impossible without the Springboks. As much as the Whites must forget, the Blacks must forgive. It's not political but human calculation (one of the film's great quotes).
Mandela then meets the team captain François Pinaar (Matt Damon) and the two men realize they speak the same language, François always wanted victory but after his pivotal encounter, he understands that the country, hosting the 1995 World Cup, needs the victory, sports don't just make people happy; it unites them in happiness. It was twice a miracle because because South Africa had to play against the iconic All-Blacks whose haka could scare enough to guarantee a victory. <br/><br/>""Invictus"" isn't just an underdog movie, it chronicles every single effort that made a miracle possible, because the miracle-maker was a miracle by himself. Visiting his cell, François realizes that he could touches two facing walls by simply spreading his arms. Anyone can survive 27 years of jailing, but can any soul? Mandela was the Captain of his soul as he was master of his fate and overcame his demons. 
François spreads the good word to the team, and like an apostle to a saint (but the film doesn't over-sanctify them) meetings are arranged with young Black kids from the poorer areas. And for once, they forget about soccer and learn about rugby not just from Chester, the only Black player.<br/><br/>The team also they learn the hymn ""Schosholoza"", that haunting melody that reminded me of that magical World Cup in Africa in 2014. The team had to win, and they won, the rest was history. Mandela understood the magic of Sports and used it as a political tool but a human miracle.<br/><br/>Maybe Morocco should watch this film before their next game against Portgual... after all, it ain't over until the referee blows his whistle."

","Sports are not my thing I've never been into them and find them boring, yet when I first heard about this movie I was extremely curious to seem if I could get over that an s for the most part I did I found this to be a very good film despite some major pacing issues. But by far the best thing about this movie are the performances from Damon and Freeman who both deservedly earned Oscar nominations for this movie, Morgan Freeman was so good in this movie not only was his accent extremely convincing but he also nailed the emotional turmoil that Mandela was going through your able to get completely behind him and Freemans performance was just overall inspiring. Matt Damon gives one of the greatest performances of his entire career in this film, he has a great parallel to Freeman and you get a sense of the similarities between them, Damon was great in the rugby scenes and also great and conveying how desperately he wanted to lead his team to victory and said like Freeman you were very easily able to get behind him. I never thought I could feel such intensity from a rugby match by my god I was on edge during every second of them because they take their time to build up the importance of winning this match and makes it all the more satisfying to watch. The relationships between the South Africans in this movie was a pleasure to watch it was done perfectly you understood all that these two peoples had been through and watching them gradually come to trust each other was fascinating and satisfying. However there are some flaws with this film and it's mainly the excruciatingly slow pace it works for the rugby scenes but outside that it's just makes scenes drag in majorly and it did bore me at time and make me just want them to get back to the rugby. This film also does lack some subtlety characters just seem to immediately say what their thinking instead of conveying it through a performance despite the fact that they could have used some of the dragged out scenes to build up some more investment. <br/><br/>Invictus is far from a perfect movie but it has very good intentions, this film has two excellent performances from Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, well directed rugby scenes, a great political and racial story and some truly inspiring scenes. <br/><br/>78%/B+"
"l_rawjalaurence","8","0","1","7 July 2016"," So-so Sporting Sequences, Uplifting Screenplay
","The sporting sequences in Clint Eastwood's film are so-so; despite the guttural grunts on the soundtrack, it's clear the actors will never be successful rugby players. The commentary on the game(s) is replete with expressions that would not be used in rugby-playing countries; this is inevitable, perhaps, when the film is aimed at mass audiences, the majority of whom are not au fait with the game's rules.<br/><br/>Yet such shortcomings should not detract from a highly uplifting film that shows how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) not only managed to unify the country during that magical year of 1995, but preached a message of hope and forgiveness that everyone could understand. Director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham are very good at depicting South Africa in the immediate aftermath of Mandela's release, when the whites and blacks had to try to get used to living as equals. This is well illustrated in the subplot involving the security guards, led by Jason (Tony Kgoroge), with white subordinates who up until a few years previously had been arresting their black counterparts. With their sharp suits and stony expressions, the white guards, led by Hendrick (Matt Stern) look especially fearsome.<br/><br/>Mandela's way of reconciling the two races was simple; not just to supplant one regime with another, but to try and reconcile everyone. Hence his insistence on preserving the Springbok name and colors for the rugby team. The sequence where he enters a meeting and overturns a majority black vote to ban the name is especially affecting; Mandela speaks slowly and in measured tones, without trying to antagonize anyone.<br/><br/>The central relationship between Mandela and South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) has been cleverly handled. While Pienaar wants to adapt to the new South Africa, it's clear he is not sure how to do so, until Mandela invites him to afternoon tea. In this oh-so-tranquil of surroundings Mandela outlines his vision and the means to accomplish it, not by imposing his will on anyone but encouraging consensus. It is a lesson well learned; in the World Cup Final when South Africa are trailing the All Blacks, Pienaar calls his team together into a huddle and reminds them of why they are playing the game, not just for themselves but the entire nation.<br/><br/>The title INVICTUS comes from a poem by the nineteenth century British writer W. H. Henley, emphasizing the importance of listening to the gods but remaining ""the captain of one's soul."" This is a lesson both Mandela and Pienaar are well aware of, as together they lead their country into a new era of national unity."

","Even though he's coming on in age, Clint Eastwood can still dazzle his audience, even when he's behind the camera. For a grizzled veteran, he still manages to come up with good quality pictures, even if not all of them are entirely great. The last really good cinematic masterpiece he truly made before ""Invictus"" was ""Million Dollar Baby"". He does have a tendency of over-casting non-performers in his movies like he did in ""Gran Torino"", even though his intentions were good. But nobody can deny that Eastwood is master in his craft and the productions of his film are taken through heart even if they're not always electrifying. <br/><br/>""Invictus"" is a very well-made movie based on a true story with touchy subjects and issues that will have you pondering for hours to come. In 1994 three years after South African political activist Nelson Mandela gets released from prison after spending three decades there, he is now the new president of South Africa and his quest to bring unity between the races with the country. When an all Caucasian rugby team who's been struggling for a championship, Mandela decides to step up and fix the team to becoming the best they can be and to erase the divinity within the races in the country. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was the perfect casting choice as Mandela. He decides that the South African team the Springboks have potential to be championship material and there he meets up with the captain of the rugby team Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)and felt his first quest was to inject unification among the Springboks as a symbolical way so that the country can have a team to be proud of and the pivotal step to expunge apartheid forever. <br/><br/>So we see kind of a two-plot story behind the movie, Invictus"". One we have Mandela adjusting his new role as the leader of his country as he's faced with plenty of turmoil that includes outrage, uproarious fear and racism. One pivotal scene was when his all-black security staff was being questioned by the Secret Service guys and later accepted. The other plot is Pienaar's initiative to encourage his rugby team to a winning season while taking part in the activities emanating in the country and trying to come to terms of a nation that's under a political unrest at the time. In one memorable scene Pienaar and his team visit the jail that where Mandela was incarcerated and enter his cell. It was a very subtle moment where the drama in this movie is the most important. <br/><br/>The two plots climatically join together as Mandela is seated to see this emotional and very important World Cup of the 1995 Rugby Championships. This final game will not just keep the sports fans enthralled, but the setup is structured beautifully. Eastwood went out of his way to create a country that at the time was struggling with politics and race issues and makes you feel for the people involved in the movie and the World Cup final match is an added bonus to the intriguing scenes depicted in the movie. <br/><br/>Though it's a great movie, there are still flaws as well. Unless you know the rules of rugby which a lot of people may not be familiar with (nothing personal) you might be lost in the rules and the way the game is operated. But it wasn't a huge drawback for me, I just wanted to see some good sports. Also there's this rather weird scene in the movie that's supposedly happened in real life, but Eastwood directs it like he's manipulating us into making it feel like a political thriller when it really isn't. But those burps won't spoil my liking for this movie. <br/><br/>Even though it's not a perfect film, ""Invictus"" is still provocative and entertaining and raises a lot of questions and if a movie can generate food for thought, it ranks high in my grading system. It truly has something for those who are enthused by political dramas plus it has something to offer for those who love sports enthusiasts."

","It had been mentioned in 2003 that the star of The Shawshank Redemption would be playing the famous South African politician and revolutionary, it took a number of years for it to actually happen, I was interested to see which event in his life they would focus on, from Oscar nominated director Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby). Based on the true story, Nelson Mandela (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman) is released from Victor Verster Prison on 11 February 1990 after 27 years of imprisonment, four years later he is elected the first black President of South Africa. Mandela faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including uncontrolled poverty and crime, he is particularly concerned about racial divisions which could lead to violence between black and white South Africans. While attending a rugby between the South African national team Springboks and England, Mandela notices the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, in their minds the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and racism, Mandela says he did the same whilst on Robben Island. South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup, knowing this Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black- dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks, he meets with the team captain François Pienaar (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Matt Damon), Mandela implies that victory for the Springboks in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation, he also shares a British poem called ""Invictus"" with François, that inspired him during his imprisonment. Training begins for François and his teammates, many black and white South Africans doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy, but Mandela and François stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country. Things start to change as the players interact and make friends with the fans, support grows for the Springboks among the black population during the opening games, by the second game the Springboks and Mandela's efforts brings together the whole country. The Springboks surpass all expectations and qualify for the final against South Africa's arch-rivals, the New Zealand team the All Blacks, New Zealand and South Africa are regarded universally as the two greatest rugby nations, up to this point the Springboks are the only side to have a winning record against the All Blacks, the intense rivalry between the two countries began in 1921. Before the game, the Springboks team visits Robben Island, where Madela spent 18 of his 27 years years in jail, there Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and the words of the poem ""Invictus"", François mentions finding it amazing Mandela could spend so many years in prison, come out, and be ready to forgive the people who put him there. A large home crowd of all races support Pienaar and the motivated team, security receive a warning of a South African Airways Boeing 747 jetliner flying low over the stadium, this is not an assassination attempt, it is a demonstration of patriotism, with a message painted on the undersides of the plane's wings for the Springboks. In the end the Springboks win the World Cup match with added time, scoring 15-12, Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, as Madela leaves and watches the South Africans celebrate, his voice is heard reciting the poem ""Invictus"". Also starring Tony Kgoroge as Jason Tshabalala, Julian Lewis Jones as Etienne Feyder, Adjoa Andoh as Brenda Mazibuko, Patrick Mofokeng as Linga Moonsamy, Matt Stern as Hendrick Booyens and Leleti Khumalo as Mary. Freeman certainly portrays the right amount of prowess as the great influential man, and he just about pulls of the difficult accent, Damon is perhaps less convincing but is still a suited to his part as the rugby team leader. The film is essentially made up of two parts, the first sees the important moments after the release of Mandela and some chat and training for the upcoming rugby games, then the second is mostly taken up by the important World Cup final which is exciting enough, even if you already know the result, I wonder if Eastwood could have chosen to do the entire life of Mandela up to the present day at the time, but I can see why this event in his life was so significant, all in all the film is an interesting enough biographical drama. Good!"

Actually it was kind of average with some very long winded sections of dialogue (speeches) and a mediocre outcome to the World Cup.<br/><br/>Usually I get all wrapped up in inspirational sports dramas but this final game was kinda meh, with continual cuts back and forth to the crowd, the game, people watching or listening at assorted venues. I guess I was also expecting the movie to be more about the rugby and less about the politics, although I did enjoy the glimpses we get into Mandela's personal life.<br/><br/>Truthfully about an hour into the movie the most interesting thing going was the ""rainbow"" team of the presidential guard and how they were interacting with each other and handling their new boss. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Nelson Mandela is very good though and Matt Damon puts on a decent South African accent (and certainly got in shape for this role) but the story itself was kinda tedious.<br/><br/>It follows newly elected president Mandela as he inspires the (losing) 1995 South African rugby team to strive for the world cup in hopes of soothing the country's racial tensions."

Unfortunately in this movie.........I must say there is a heavily political shaping of the truth which in fact far from it.<br/><br/>1. What they fail to mention is that Mandela who incidentally prior to his incarceration wrote the pamphlet, ""How To Be A Good Communist,"" has simply been put there to ensure there is no disruption to the running of South Africa by the Rothschild-Oppenheimer family and in particular their gold and diamond mining interests.<br/><br/>2. Indeed the current head of the Oppenheimer family, Harry Oppenheimer, owns 95% of the world's diamond mines. Isn't it surprising that the Jewish media fail to inform their readers why, if the blacks in South Africa are getting Africa for the Africans, all the gold and diamond mines, ie. the wealth of South Africa, is still controlled by Jews.<br/><br/>3. Communism was of course invented for the Rothschilds' by Moses Mordechai Levy, more commonly known by his Crypto-Jew name of Karl Marx, which makes it no surprise that the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa was guided by two Communist Jews, Albie Sachs, and Yossel Mashel Slovo (Joe Slovo). Indeed, when Nelson Mandela's ANC took over South Africa, Slovo was named Minister of Housing.<br/><br/>4. Communism is designed to concentrate the wealth in the hands of the few Jews at the top (plus in this case, the odd token black man), whilst the population of the country they have usurped is left in poverty. It therefore should come as no surprise that none of the mineral wealth controlled by Rothschild front men, the Oppenheimer family, is returned to the black people and instead, South Africa, far from becoming free, experiences a dramatic decrease in living standards for the black population, and rapidly declines to the status of the world's most violent and crime-ridden country. AIDS infection soars to at least 25% of the black population and Mandela's successor, Thabo Mbeki, son of one of the terrorists jailed alongside Mandela, Govan Mbeki, after he succeeds Mandela as President, states that poverty, not HIV is the cause of AIDS."

","Usually I am not much into sports and related movies, but certain directors and actors make an exception. Clint Eastwood is definitely one of them; I happened to see his Trouble With the Curve first and I was sure that focusing on genuine sports battle would not be the main theme here either. And it was so: the main topic is how rugby had its part in creating inter-racial confidence in South Africa right after abolishment of apartheid, and what was the role of South African President Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South Africa rugby union team (Springboks) François Pienaar -- played by Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, respectively (and giftedly). The scenes - based on real events and a strong book - run smoothly, the choice of background music is just to the point, and viewers get a versatile picture of one of the 20th century greatest statesman whose desire and aim was to create a ""all-inclusive"" society, without punishing those who just were ordinary employees and workers during the previous segregated system (different from the case with socialist leaders who mostly deprived, deported or killed most ""carriers"" of previous social order). Of course, Mandela was highly educated and lettered, not like e.g. Stalin or Mao Zedong...<br/><br/>Invictus is a nice movie, providing additional and realistic knowledge of life in South Africa in the 1990ies, and encourages to use popular activities/games/sports etc. in leveling confrontations."

","Against all the odds, Nelson Mandela tries to inspire the South African rugby team to win the world cup in hopes of uniting a nation torn apart by racism.Luckily for Invictus' predictable story, it is handled by a real master of cinema. Eastwood certainly knows how to make movies. Like Any Given Sunday and Escape to Victory before it, Invictus had me engaged and entertained despite having no interest in the sport. Eastwood manages to inject some extra motivation by also concentrating on the political aspects of the story. The event itself starts to overshadow the characters, and Eastwood grasps for something a bit more thrilling with a number of red-herring assassin moments. It's solid movie making, with a couple of flat moments."

","Clint Eastwood delivers us an inspirational true story of South Africa's triumph during the 1995 World Cup. Led by the spirits of Nelson Mandela (Freeman), he inspires the young and unmotivated South African rugby team to try for the gold and make their country proud. <br/><br/>As you know, movies are bound to have flaws. My main thought of a flaw was Matt Damon's accent, it was not music to my eardrums. He performed well, but I just wasn't one for the voice. Also, some of their accents (like Damon's) were a complete nightmare and truly hard to understand at times. I liked how they focused on both a part of Mandela's political career and the rugby aspects of the film. It was a good movie, some scenes were great, and others I just couldn't help but get bored by. <br/><br/>Besides all of that, Morgan Freeman does not disappoint in his role and gives us his usual great cinema Godly performance. <br/><br/>With sports movies, you can rarely ever go wrong. Regardless of how much I don't like rugby, I did enjoy most aspects of the film; so it was pretty good as far as sports films go. <br/><br/>VERDICT: 75/100"
"intern-88","9","0","1","22 June 2012"," You need more than rugby to bury Apartheid
","'One Team, One Country.' The team was the Springboks; the country was South Africa. The slogan was the brainwave of Edward Griffiths, who was CEO of the South African rugby union and communications director of the South Africa rugby team during the 1995 World Cup.<br/><br/>On 24 June 1995, 43million South Africans came together to watch the Springboks beat the New Zealand All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup final at the Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg. Invictus, a new film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on John Carlin's book Playing The Enemy, celebrates this feat as the crowning moment in Nelson Mandela's campaign to forge a new, democratic South Africa. Non-South Africans may wonder: why rugby?<br/><br/>For South Africans, rugby is a big deal. It was the sport of the hated ruling Afrikaners and as much an icon of Apartheid as the orange-white- blue flag of the old regime or its national anthem 'Die Stem'. No black person would be associated with the sport on principle. Football was the game of black South Africa, while Indians, like my family, played cricket. Everyone (including all the prisoners incarcerated with Mandela on Robben Island) always supported the away-team against South Africa. My mother still supports England against South Africa – old habits die hard.<br/><br/>As much as rugby was hated by the black majority, it inspired a religious fervour in the Afrikaners. They had suffered under the sports boycott that prevented South Africa from competing internationally in the one sport it excelled at. Mandela's eureka moment was to recognise that if he could win the hearts and minds of the Afrikaners through their one great passion, rugby, then governing the new South Africa would be a great deal easier. With the 1995 Rugby World Cup being held in South Africa, Mandela saw an ideal opportunity to unite the country. But winning over the black masses to his PR campaign was not going to be easy.<br/><br/>The campaign around the Rugby World Cup reflected the realpolitik of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). During the struggle to overthrow Apartheid, the ANC had allied itself with the Communist Party (SACP) – and the SACP's rhetoric was far more effective at mobilising the black masses than the elitist middle-class nationalism of the ANC leadership. But in power, after the first democratic elections of 1994 following Mandela's release from prison in 1990, the ANC was eager to shake off its communist and working-class allies and build new alliances with the middle classes and capitalist elites in South Africa. What better means than rugby to achieve this new coalition?<br/><br/>Invictus, Latin for 'unconquered', is the title of a short poem by the British poet William Ernest Henley. Mandela used to recite it to himself while in prison. Eastwood's film focuses on the build-up to the World Cup final and the developing bond between Springbok captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) and Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman). Damon is a convincing Afrikaner, while Freeman, who has been Oscar-nominated for his performance, is an uncanny look-a-like for Mandela. He's so impressive that I can forgive the odd lapse in pronunciation. It doesn't matter that he says 'perry' instead of 'petty' and 'Springbucks' instead of 'Springboks', because in every other way he is very credible.<br/><br/>Alongside this pivotal relationship, there are some lighter comedic moments, too, like the understandably indignant reactions of the newly appointed black bodyguards who find themselves having to work alongside those who once protected FW de Klerk's Apartheid government. The white guards talk rugby; the blacks don't. They are puzzled by Mandela's newfound interest in the sport, especially when he overrides a decision by the militant government sports department to change the name of the team from the hated Springboks to the more neutral Proteas.<br/><br/>Why take such a stubborn stand over such a petty issue, Mandela's secretary asks him? Mandela responds that if he can't face up to hard decisions now, then he never will. This recognition of the difficulty of forging a new alliance underpins the worldwide respect and admiration for Mandela.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, a Boeing 747 flies low over Johannesburg; its thunderous roar terrifying the 62,000 in the stadium waiting for the big rugby final to start. Then, when the plane's underside with the words 'Good Luck Bokke' painted on it in giant black letters, become visible, terror turns to delight. Just before kick-off, Mandela walks on to the field to meet the Springboks team. 'Nelson, Nelson, Nelson' call the crowds ecstatically, and the chants are shown reverberating in living rooms and pubs around South Africa.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling a little teary – but optimistic, too. It may be because as a South African living abroad at the time, I wasn't there when the masses celebrated Mandela's release; I wasn't there when the nation queued to vote in the first democratic election; and I missed this last euphoric moment when rugby briefly united a country.<br/><br/>Today, it all feels like a long time ago. The assertion of ethnic rights, the desperate protests in the squatter camps and the squabble over resources in a period of global recession have seen to that. Will this year's football World Cup achieve something similar? Or is the belief that sport can bring unity and purpose to a divided country nothing but a chimera, like the rainbow that disappears when the sun is no longer shining?"

","Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul.<br/><br/>In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br/><br/>Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br/><br/>It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/>That is one powerful poem I tell you. I know it inspires me, and it is one of things that kept Nelson Mandela going during his 25 years in prison. The film Invictus from 2009 directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Matt Damon is a good movie. Is it a great movie hmmmm.....well some of my biggest problems with the movie are things that actually are true, so I don't know what to think. I mean Nelson Mandela chooses a rugby team to be the symbol of cooperation and reconciliation after apartheid, and then shortly thereafter they host the world cup and he in part Drives the team to victory and gets the country to rally together black and white behind this one cause. Well I would normally say come on I can write better fiction in my sleep. However, it pretty much went down that way, so what can you do but heap another log on the grand fire that is the legend of Nelson Mandela. Morgan Freeman does a spot on Mandela and it helps they do kind of look alike. I liked this movie, I didn't love this movie, nor do I think it is a classic in the making, but with time maybe my mind will change. In any event I learned a really kick ass poem. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

","Rugby is in the soul, the heart and the mind. If you are lucky, it is held within your Family as The Greatest of Sports. If you expect Invictus to deliver some great Rugby you are watching the wrong film. Go watch Ireland's Grand Slam 2009 DVD's or the British & Irish Lions Tour from 2009. If you want a truly compelling, well directed movie with it's basis in Rugby then watch Invictus. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Madiba (let's face it Morgan Freeman does not do bad performances) and in fairness to Matt Damon he pulls off the role of François Pienaar rather well. François Pienaar himself was happy with the representation, so should everyone else. Damon is maturing into a very fine actor and Eastwood is (I believe) an exceptional director (watch Gran Torino and call me a liar). Invictus tugs at the heart strings and delivers a message about being colour blind, not only that it gives us all a brief view of what Nelson Mandela suffered though. If you ever wanted a feel good movie, then in a roundabout way, this is it."
"ajs-10","8","0","1","25 April 2011"," Inspirational stuff from Clint Eastwood...
","I guess I should state at the start that I am a huge fan of Rugby Union, the game featured in this film. A little sceptical when I first put the disc in the DVD player because I'm not a fan of South Africa, I'm English, but my worst fears were soon put aside. The film focuses on Nelson Mandela's efforts to unite his country, and how he used rugby as part of this process. Based on true events, much of the story is about a country divided along lines if race that is now emerging into a new era. To help ease this process, and to get many of the whites on his side, Nelson Mandela inspires the captain of the Springboks, the South African rugby team, François Pienaar, and encourages him in his quest to win the World Cup, which is being hosted there.<br/><br/>Technically, this is a very well made film, although, as is usual with sports in films, the close-up action shots do appear to be staged (which, of course, they are). This failing aside, it's a very well written script and there are some very nice performances. There is a nice little sub-plot involving Mandela's security people, who are all black at the beginning, but when they ask for more men, Mandela sends some white security people round. After a little uncertainty at first, we see them gradually earn each other's trust as the film progresses. A neat little device that illustrates the points being made in the main part of the movie.<br/><br/>Unusually for a film of this type, the two main characters, who are both very inspirational men, seldom meet. When they do, you can feel the strength of Mandela giving encouragement to Pienaar. This comes across very well and even I was rooting for the Springboks by the end of the film (and I already knew who won!). I remember well watching the final, where Mandela pulled off a great stroke by wearing a Springboks shirt. This had been a symbol of power to the whites and a symbol of oppression to the blacks in South Africa. This one simple act did much to unite the nation and greatly inspire the team.<br/><br/>Two great performances; Morgan Freeman really nailed the voice and the mannerisms of Nelson Mandela, of course, he doesn't really look much like him, but I guess you can't have everything. Matt Damon did a great job as François Pienaar, inspirational speeches and a lot of physical work also, but, again, he doesn't really look like the man he's portraying. I can forgive that as they both did a really good job.<br/><br/>Over all I found this a very inspirational film with some great moments. It features two very good performances, but I did find it a little too long and the close-up action looked a little too staged. Having said that, I would watch it again sometime and I'm sure I would find more things to like about it. I do like the very measured style Clint Eastwood uses in the films he directs, nothing is too overstated and I have to admire him for that. Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.5/10"

","The truth of why I didn't watch this film until now is that politics and sport are literally the two things attract me least, nevertheless after a second thought, I would like to give Clint Eastwood another chance, anyway, how worse it could be? <br/><br/>So, the after effect is that it does make me apathetic in spite of the fact that technically speaking, Clint Eastwood may not deserve a standing ovation, but actually he did a decent job to strive for a lesser poignant affectation in viewing of the vast backdrop story of a world- famous ex-president of South Africa.<br/><br/>One thing I do enjoy in this film is the cinematography, reminds me of MYSTIC RIVER (2003) and MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), my favorite films of Mr. Eastwood (thanks to the same DP Tom Stern). The scene where the plane flied over the stadium is the eureka moment for me, otherwise I must admit that I have seen better. <br/><br/>The two Oscar-nominated leads Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are surely watchable but way overrated in my own opinion, especially the latter, Matt is physically not a rugby player no matter how hard he tries, also his character is in lack of a deeper excavation. As for old Morgan, his imitation of Mandela is worthy of some compliments but does not make my top 5 list of 2009. <br/><br/>The biography genre usually is Clint's masterpiece, the upcoming biopic of J. Edger has raised my expectation to an utmost peak (finger crossed for Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Watts, Armie Hammer and Judi Dench). Hope it will get Mr. Eastwood another culmination as personally I show more respect towards those late bloomers."
"MartinHafer","8","0","3","1 March 2011"," Very inspiring but no surprises
","While I am a history teacher and know much more about South African history than the average American, but as an American I am still woefully ignorant of this far away country's history. Most everyone here knows almost nothing about Mandela and South Africa---so we are usually unable to critically examine ""Invictus""--only to enjoy it. So I have no idea if Nelson Mandela is as wonderfully kind and wise as he is in the film or more just an ordinary man. In other words, is this an accurate biography or is it hero worship...I just don't know. And this movie gets me to thinking that perhaps it is time I do get to know more about the man and the nation--especially as I am planning on visiting there in 2013. I mention all this because usually when I review films I am VERY critical of the historical accuracy of a movie but in this case I am just not the best person to be doing this. It also makes me feel bad that I just don't know more about the country--especially since our news stories pretty much stopped on South Africa following the collapse of Apartheid.<br/><br/>""Invictus"" is an interesting film because it's like a biography and history lesson combined. At times, it focuses on Mandela as President of the new South Africa and others it focuses on the divided nation--and bounces back and forth between this. This is NOT a bad thing, as using the metaphor of rugby to represent the nation is a clever way to tell the story. The only problem is that although it's quite inspiring and well made, the viewer is never surprised--not even once. What you think will happen, happens. And, oddly, there isn't even a plot device to bring in any tension or make the viewer doubt the outcome in the least. As a result, it's easy to see why ""Hurt Locker"" beat out ""Invictus"" for the Best Picture Oscar and I think other nominees I've seen (such as ""Precious"" and ""Avatar"") were better films. However, I COULD see how ""Invictus"" won acting Oscars, as this was top-notch. Oddly, however, Morgan Freeman played a much smaller man (Mandela) and the opposite is true of Matt Damon playing a much bigger man than he really is.<br/><br/>While it's almost completely unlikely to ever happen, I'd sure love to be able to watch this film with a mixed group of South Africans--to listen to their insights and comments on what is occurring. I did not see this on DVD, so perhaps the DVD has some similar sort of commentary--it would be most enlightening if there is such an option."
"tieman64","Null","0","3","31 January 2011"," Cool Runnings 2: Mandela Strikes Back
","Clint Eastwood rapes history with ""Invictus"", a film which tells the story of newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela's attempts to use the 1995 Rugby World Cup to bring whites and blacks together in the wake of almost half a century of apartheid. <br/><br/>Using a conventional fairy tale ""sporting movie"" narrative, the film watches as the underdog SA rugby team beats opponent after opponent before finding themselves in the World Cup final against New Zealand. As the final game is played, blacks and whites join hands and watch with shared anticipation. By the time the final game is won, racial and economic divisions have dissolved before our eyes, SA brought to racial harmony via the decimation of foreigners on a playing field by Gladiator-like thugs. The film's message: colonialism deserves forgiveness and dismissal, never justice, 50 years of racial segregation, persecution and murder have be healed through ""sports"" and ""democracy"", and Mandela was a kindly old man who brought unity to a country. <br/><br/>This, of course, is nonsense. Firstly, the film omits the embarrassing fact that the New Zealand team was poisoned, a fact which Mandela's former head of security, Rory Steyn, has recently publicly admitted. How much is victory worth when one hires an Eastern gambling syndicate to knock out one's opponent? <br/><br/>Secondly, their is little to no racial harmony in SA. Mandela, upon release from prison, was unwittingly used as a puppet. He became the ""noble"" face of new capitalism, yet another anti-authoritarian critic of old dictatorships who transformed into a 1980s-90s neoliberal ruler (Alfonsin (Argentina), Aquino (Philippines), Aristide (Haiti), Bhutto (Pakistan), Chiluba (Zambia), Dae Jung (South Korea), Havel (Czech Republic), Manley (Jamaica), Megawati (Indonesia), Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Museveni (Uganda), Nujoma (Namibia), Obasanjo (Nigeria), Ortega (Nicaragua), Rawlings (Ghana), Walesa (Poland), Yeltsin (Russia) etc). Under him, racial apartheid became class apartheid, SA sold off to foreign or local white multinationals, who kept the best land, mines, plants, financial institutions, who were pardoned for various crimes and were allowed to export vast quantities of capital. Such intra-elite economic deals, including the agreement to pay ridiculous debts accrued by the apartheid regime, worsened poverty, unemployment, inequality and exacerbated many racial, gender and geographical differences. <br/><br/>SA is now the most violent country outside a war zone, with the highest recorded per capita murder rate in the world. So violent is the ""free"" and ""democratic"" South Africa, that the ANC – the African National Congress – imposed an official blackout on national crime statistics. Even when statistics are released, they are heavily doctored.<br/><br/>With this instability, comes a flight of ""white locals"". Since 1994, more than a million whites and foreigners have left SA, mostly due to an increase in crime and social instability. The author of the book upon which ""Invictus"" was based himself emigrated after being the victim of several crimes. Meanwhile, a subgroup of fat-cats - both white and black - blossoms, slowly pillaging the country, through both design and ineptitude. In other words, the film completely ignores apartheid's continued, and deep-rooted, effects on the self-determination of modern SA. There is no ""unity"" or ""harmony"". There is no ""rainbow nation"". Apartheid level racial income inequalities still persist, whites are persecuted and blacks triply so, many dying at the hands of thugs paid to oversee black workers. Mandela would himself do a complete about turn on his 1990 pre-Presidence promise to nationalise resources, banks and monopoly industries. He went from a man whom Britain (MI5) and America (CIA) routinely tried to assassinate and eventually jailed, to a Western mascot. His wife would denounce him for betraying SA's blacks, allowing himself to be used by those in power to legitimise their post-apartheid manoeuvres.<br/><br/>Bizarrely, ""Invictus"" completely airbrushes white violence, but never black violence, which is always presented as a possibility and a threat. Likewise, racism and colonialism, for the whites, is never treated as being anything more than a lapse of judgement or unfortunate error. Elsewhere the film completely ignores one of the primary problems preventing ""unity"" in SA today. How does one apply the principle of Government of the People, by the People, for the People, if ""The People"" are divided (most of these divisions were specifically manufactured in the past for reasons of control), culturally, ethnically, linguistically, historically, economically and materially? The ANC's answer, like this film and the apartheid government before it, is to divide the country into a nation of blacks and whites, Us against Thems, Haves and Have Nots etc in order to further polarise the country's population along racial line for the purposes of engendering further political support.<br/><br/>Eastwood portrays Mandela giving SA's rugby captain a poem by William Henley called ""Invictus"". In reality, the literature Mandela gave was ""The Man In The Arena"", the title of a speech given by Teddy Roosevelt in Paris on April 23rd, 1910. Both pieces of writing are about self mastery, but with a very subtle difference, ""Invictus"" being a work of unabashed optimism (""I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.""), Roosevelt's being more downbeat: ""there is only error and shortcoming"" and yet ""the credit belongs to the man who struggles in the arena for a worthy cause"". The film's switch from Roosevelt to Henley epitomises its preference for fantasy and blind-eye turning.<br/><br/>The film stars actor Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela. It's a hagiographical portrait, Freeman portraying Mandela as a kindly old man who spews Yoda-like wisdom. The film also contains no references to the more militant backgrounds of Mandella, largely because white, middle class audiences are left confused and horrified by revolutionary violence. The point is not that Mandela was not a great man, but that ""Invictus"" ignores why he was great, distorts why he wasn't into something ""great"", and has very little bearing on reality. It is the Walt Disney version of history, shallow and dishonest. <br/><br/>4/10 – Worth one viewing."
"jacobs-36","5","0","2","25 January 2011"," Morgan Freeman
","Alright, SO is it just me, or was Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie, Invictus, far from Oscar Nomination worthy? I was genuinely excited to see this movie before its release, due to the political and revolutionary depth of the plot, mixed with an inspiration story about South Africa's Rugby Team. In addition to that, I have almost always loved Morgan Freeman as an actor in previous movies. However, after watching Invictus for the first time, I was a little bit discouraged by the quality of his acting. I have since watched it several more times, enough to come to the conclusion that Morgan Freeman, in some ways, ruined this movie. I feel this way for several reasons, but perhaps the most significant flaw of his performance was that his accent was not very good at all. I mean, granted it is somewhat of a hard accent to conquer I am sure, Freeman did not make for a believable Nelson Mandela. I could not help but notice that each and every line of his, seemed forced and a bit ""off"". He is a great actor, but I just do not know if accents are his thing. Morgan Freeman has one of the greatest voices in the world of acting, and is known for having such a pleasant demeanor about him. He should stick to roles that lack international accents. Nelson Mandela is such a significant and beloved hero in South Africa, I believe that someone who is attempting to act as Mandela should deliver a firm dialect, but Morgan Freeman's accent was inadequate for the role."
"tim_sims","8","0","1","20 January 2011"," Good but slightly overdone
","Anyone of a certain age who follows rugby knows the story. South Africa, rightly (imo) banned from international sport during the apartheid era, return shortly after the first democratic elections there and upset all the odds by winning the 1995 world cup. Plus they beat the overwhelming favourites, New Zealand, in the final. And most importantly, Nelson Mandela and Francois Pienaar turn the victory on the field into an inter-racial healing of some very deep wounds. It was (if you're of a certain age) one of those rare moments when sport stops being a glorious irrelevance and actually has some lasting and real meaning. It moved me and I dare say many others deeply, and even as a die-hard Welsh rugby fan (and they don't come much more die-hard than that) I've had a soft spot for the Boks ever since.<br/><br/>With a true story like that it would be hard for a director of Eastwood's quality to go wrong. And for the most part Invictus gets it right. The lingering racial tension, for instance between the white and black bodyguards, is well captured, as is the slow process of the Boks realising they're more than just a rugby team. I'd join many others in praising Morgan Freeman's Mandela, not simply as a statesmanlike saint but with just enough of a hint of the neglect of more conventional affairs of state which is starting to appear in more critical commentaries on his presidency. And I'd be more positive than some about Matt Damon's portrayal of Francois Pienaar. I had the honour of meeting Pienaar during the following world cup here in Wales, and his own description then of how he felt in 1995 - that he became a national symbol of reunion without asking for it, knowing how to cope with it or even realising it was happening until near the end - pretty much sums up what we see on screen.<br/><br/>Yet for all that there are moments when the film applies the pathos too thickly. Too many scenes are spoilt by schmaltzy backing music that would be better suited to a TV miniseries. The scene on Robben Island is perhaps overlong, and the point - that Pienaar is starting to understand what Mandela went through and why - doesn't need rammed home with the clumsy appearance of a ghostly Mandela breaking rocks. And the scene near the end with the white cops and the black child outside the final strains credulity: apartheid-era bigotry instantly changed into inter-racial unity by radio commentary on a Joel Stransky drop goal. Maybe Eastwood felt the need to do this for the benefit of those who weren't so familiar with what actually happened. But if you do know what happened, it's all a bit unnecessary: the story should speak for itself.<br/><br/>On balance, though, these are minor criticisms. Invictus successfully weaves together sporting, racial and political themes in an unusual and powerful way. If it sometimes lacks subtlety then you might say the reality it depicts was anything but subtle. Those of us who remember can relive a moment we won't quickly forget. Those who don't can watch this and perhaps understand why."

","After watching this, I'm surprised Morgan Freeman didn't win the Oscar. I guess because he's won before is why they didn't give it to him. He was great, but I would only say the movie was average. Mainly because the movie was too long and the final half hour was just the rugby match. It went on too long. Plus, as someone whom knows nothing about rugby, it just made it boring watching all those scenes. That should have been cut down to make the film come in at 2 hours. And I'm not sure why Matt Damon got nominated for awards. His accent was awful and seemed to come and go. And his character had few dramatic scenes. What did he do besides tell his team to listen to the crowd singing and a whole country supporting them.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's long. I recommend it if you want to see a great acting performance or if you are watching it on DVD so you can stop it a few times. I couldn't sit through it in one viewing."

","It's almost a shame, that we only get to see such a short part of Mandelas life. Matt Damon never really convinced me either in his role (his accent seemed to fade away at times or get thicker). But it's of course Morgan Freeman and his role of a lifetime (leaving his ""Bruce Almighty"" appearance aside that is).<br/><br/>And Morgan plays it as good as it can get. There are really strong themes here and some very interesting points get touched. Well more scratched that is. Because we never dig deeper. And while it is impossible to really capture a human and all his facades into one film, it still leaves a bitter taste, when you don't know what exactly drove him to do some of the things he did. While I'm for not over-explaining things, it seems that the movie oversimplifies some things.<br/><br/>It just feels that something is missing. Or maybe it is, that Clint spoiled us and we expect every movie to be a masterpiece. Whatever it is, this is definitely worth watching, though if you really are looking for some insight into Mandela, I guess there will be some books out who will be more helpful"

","Invictus is a movie I avoided for a while due to the uninteresting subject matter that was at hand for me. I am well aware of Nelson Mandella's accomplishments, and what he did, but in reality he didn't interest me all that much. Rugby is also a sport I detest because I get bored easily from it. Invictus surprised me by keeping me involved with its story, and despite the long running time, I was never bored during any of it. Invictus deserves praise for giving us a very good story, but it is Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman who deserve real kudos. Morgan Freeman's mannerisms and impersonation of Nelson was simply uncanny, and I really felt he pulled it off beautifully. Clint Eastwood's direction is also on the ball as usual. He directs with a certain flair and tenacity during the Rugby scenes. Nothing overly intense, but very effective and impressive for my liking. The only thing that bothered me was that despite the feel-good ending, the rugby team did NOT win that way.<br/><br/>Performances. Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Mandella. He has mannerisms down to a T, and I truly felt he WAS Nelson Mandella. Is he Oscar worthy? Not quite, but he is still very, very good. Matt Damon is equally as impressive as Francois. His accent is a bit inconsistent, but I admired his intensity and all business attitude. He was engrossing to watch.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Invictus isn't the Oscar epic it so desperately wanted to be. However it is still an interesting movie that I recommend quite highly.<br/><br/>8/10"

","My wife rented this yesterday and we watched together last night. Our 10 year-old son came into the living room to watch a time or two but the movie didn't hold his attention.<br/><br/>In principle it's a very compelling story (Mandela and the Springboks, writ small as it were). However I felt that the movie wore its morality too strongly and without pause or nuance. The moral dimensions of this story would have been better conveyed if done with more subtlety.<br/><br/>I normally really like Morgan Freeman however as I thought about how he was doing this role I realized that playing Nelson Mandela is very, very hard. Perhaps impossible. The real Nelson Mandela projects a quality that's almost beatific and actually not unlike, say, the Dali Lama. Few human beings possess that quality. A less well-known name that comes to mind is the American monk Thomas Merton.<br/><br/>The 'scare tactic' at the end where we're showed a possibly evil, white face followed by an ensuing 'tension' was abrupt; not organic; and felt like it had been tacked on.

","The story of how Nelson Mandela, after becoming the leader of South Africa following the demise of the apartheid regime, tried to heal the racially divided country by, among other things, supporting the Springboks, the South African rugby team, who were supported by the white minority and hated by blacks, during the 1995 World Cup (the Springboks managed to win). Matt Damon does a nice turn as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbooks, who coming like the rest of his teammates from an Afrikaner home hostile to the new regime slowly warms up to Mandela. Morgan Freeman is almost insufferable as the new president, showing him almost as a holy fool, a naive, always smiling, quasi imbecile. The real Mandela, who was (for a good cause) the leader of Africa's main armed faction for more than thirty years, is probably made of sterner stuff. You don't have to be a cynic to find this movie trite and corny, full of cringing dialogue that is almost painful to listen. Even the rugby scenes shown here are uninspiring. A disappointment."
"rainbird131162","Null","0","1","4 August 2010"," Quietly superb, emotionally stirring Eastwood movie
","A quietly superb film from Clint Eastwood, Invictus is another genre defying entry from a director with a long track record of them, that is not quite a sports movie but neither is it a biography of its world famous central character Nelson Mandela. <br/><br/>Anthony Peckham's clever script is nominally about Mandela's support - over fierce objections from his own party - for the hated national Springbok rugby team & how their improbable victory at the 1995 world cup finally overcame the bitter divisions of the apartheid era to unite the country. But what we have here is equally a subtle study in Mandela's brilliant grasp of strategy & leadership (he has his aides test him on the names of the Springboks so that when he meets them for the first time he can greet them like old friends) & his shrewd recognition that unless the black majority can demonstrate forgiveness to a sceptical & suspicious white minority - one that controls the banks, the police & the army - the country is doomed. Key to this is attracting much needed foreign investment (the eyes of the world are watching anxiously) & when Mandela learns that a billion people will be watching the rugby cup final he instantly grasps the PR significance of this for his country & for the world if the Springboks can win the cup. <br/><br/>Freeman is impressively understated here not only capturing Mandela's physical mannerisms (the hunched shoulders from spending decades in a tiny cell) but also leaving it up to the audience to decide whether his public concern for those he must work with - expressed through a succession of carefully calibrated speeches - is genuine or simply the work of a brilliant tactician shrewdly exploiting his media image as a saint. There are hints, here & there, of Mandela's estrangement from his own family & these touchingly remind us that behind the public image is a man who paid a very high personal price for his actions. A convincingly beefed up Matt Damon is also excellent as the Springbok Captain Francois Piennar. Francois doesn't pretend to understand the politics of the situation but he can intuit immediately that the situation he's in concerns something far greater than just a sports victory as he tries to convince his sceptical team mates. As per Freeman it's delightfully understated acting & it's a very good demonstration of Damon's versatility. <br/><br/>There's also a satisfying parallel storyline to Mandela's efforts which centres on his bodyguards. These guys are perpetually fearful of an assassination attempt & it's a task not made any easier by Mandela's habit of wanting to leave his entourage to go on impromptu walkabouts in the crowds. His security detail are a mixed team of black & whites who on first meeting view each other with barely disguised hostility. Indeed, on their initial encounter the first question out of the mouth of the black guard is 'Have you come to arrest me?'! In the hands of a lesser director & writer this would have descended into cringe-making backslapping & we're-all-brothers-under-the-skin proclamations, but Eastwood is too good a director to fall for this & the slow recognition that both teams are on the same side simply develops organically, without ever seeming forced.<br/><br/>The climactic rugby scenes are satisfyingly crunchy, clearly filmed (there's a refreshing absence of Paul Greengrass-style shaky-cam shots) & the gist of the game is communicated clearly even if the specifics remain obscure. There's also a jaw-dropping scene involving a 747 Jumbo that is one of those outrageous moments so WTF? that it could only have come from real life (& indeed did actually happen). The stadium sequences depicting thousands of cheering supporters are pretty staggering & demonstrate just how far crowd software has come since Gladiator's famous arena shot. As impressive as that was I always felt there was something not quite right about it but the CG crowds packing Ellis stadium here are completely convincing, indeed overwhelming at times. Invictus is also, I think, superbly edited & it seemed to go by remarkably quickly for a two hour plus movie. <br/><br/>As for Eastwood, he's a directorial marvel avoiding so many of the pitfalls inherent in this kind of material. There's no sense of self- importance about Invictus. The film is epic & yet intimate, if that makes any sense. It wears its themes very lightly, as if aware that the material is so strong it doesn't need amping up. Eastwood's understated, unemphatic approach amusingly drives the lazy, the impatient & the immature viewer up the wall but I found his approach so stirring it had me welling up with tears on more than one occasion. Whether it's Francois telling his stunned family he's been invited to tea with Mandela, an absolutely exquisitely judged sequence on the infamous penal colony of Robben Island, where Francois imagines Mandela reciting Invictus in his tiny cell, a blink & you'll miss it moment as a tough white bodyguard hurriedly puts his sunglasses on to hide the fact that he's tearing up at the Springboks having reached the final, or gently underscoring the reconciliation theme by crosscutting the climactic match with a black kid slowly edging closer to a group of cops listening to the match on their car radio, Eastwood makes this kind of ambitious filmmaking, so littered with obvious booby traps just look so bloody easy. Granted Invictus is unabashedly feel good but there's nothing wrong with that provided it's as well done as it is here. It's a film that leaves you buzzing & although corny to say it - yep - uplifted as well. Recommended, but do try & catch it on the biggest screen you can."
"Hitchcoc","7","0","1","31 July 2010"," Bland Retelling
","Having read extensively about the situation in South Africa and being a great admirer of Mandela, I was disappointed in this film. Yes, Morgan Freeman looks like and acts like the great president. Yes the events are portrayed in a relatively accurate way. It's just that there doesn't seem to be a great dramatic question. Nothing is portrayed on the edge like they need to be. The racial issue is there but it is pretty sanitized and almost cute at times. There are also some silly tricks that I won't mention because they would be spoilers. There are two ways to go with this biographical stuff. You can go all the way and get down and dirty (like the issues in Coetzee's ""Disgrace""), or you can make it a moral tale with little taking place. The Rugby team needed some life and some real tension. There had to be more internal strife than that portrayed in this film. When it was over, my response was, ""OK! Apartheid ended. What is the aftermath?"" It isn't even quite there when it comes to sport. I also would like to have seen a little more explanation about the tension between Mandela and his daughter."

","Here is the plot: Nelson Mandela (played by Morgan Freeman), upon becoming president, decides to use his country's return to international interaction as a catalyst for smoothing the segue from apartheid to a mixed society. He decides that the beloved (by whites) rugby team should be the focal point and asks the captain, played by Matt Damon, to inspire his men.<br/><br/>Why it fails: 1)Like Glory or Remember the Titans, this movies simply tells a story by having one episode after another without any depth of character or emotional charge, as though the source material of evil white people was enough to move you to cry(as opposed to Rudi, when he practices or gets rejected or finally makes the field you feel it, not so with Invictus). There is nothing inspiring nor moving, the direction is flat, and the three chapters to the movie are impossible to distinguish. Matt Damon takes his fellow prisoners on a trip to the prison where Mandela was for almost thirty years, but what should have been motivating was not. Morgan Freeman voice overs a poem, Invictus, during this visit, but his normally beautiful voice is wasted in over-sentimentality which not only beat the point to death but was difficult to understand. The movie seems to set up that Matt Damon will motivate his players to counter the New Zealanders' Maori psychologically devastating pregame war dance. Does he get the men to learn the ANC anthem to get them prepared before the match? It is impossible to tell what or whether they sing. A truly failed moment.<br/><br/>2) The dialog is dull, you remember almost none of it after the movie. Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor but almost all he does here is issue Ghandi-like one-liners which does not have nearly the same effect as they did in Ghandi.<br/><br/>3) In summary, the whole thing is emotionally flat, Mandela is a great man, but his legacy is white-washed from the ANC violence, not one Rugby player's personality was developed, including Matt Damon's, the directing was uninspiring,a good movie for people who want to feel politically correct and but have no depth."

","I just watched Invictus for the second time tonight. From the review I had submitted previously there seemed to be something wildly wrong with my eyes. My review was discarded by all four readers. Should I reconsider my opinion? I thought so. There must have been something I missed. Mr. Nelson Mandela is a human being of great magnitude. So is Mr. Morgan Freeman and Mr. Clint Eastwood. So I decided to give the film another try. I have Video On Demand so it isn't much trouble to find it outside the cinema. I don't even have to buy the disc. Which I will eventually. But all this is beside the point. What the movie left behind was the astonishing Mr. Damon's new physique, showing it all, practically. I could hardly believe my eyes. He has grown from a physically unbelievably attractive Mr. Ripley to The Incredible Hulk. His face is bloated and not at all of any resemblance to the one I used to love . In my humble opinion muscles like that can only be achieved through years of workout, unless steroids are part and parcel of it. I went online to check various facts, because I thought I was somehow terribly wrong. I'm afraid I wasn't. Rugby is not a muscle-bound middle-aged men's game. Believe you me. See The Four Feathers UK (2002). What Invictus amounts to though, in all it's unmistakable excellence, is partly a prelude to a gay skin flick, whatever other qualities it does have. With all due respect. A question: What purpose does Matt Damon's naked torso serve in a picture of a nations' emancipation? I simply cannot get over the gay instructor's showing his class how to build an Invictus body. I wasn't wrong. Something else is. Great as it may be in other areas. My god what a disappointment, and I won't budge. Muscle up some strength and put your computer to good use. There is nothing wrong with an excellent musculature, Greek style. But this is really quite over the top.... Greek style.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with being gay. I am comfortably so. But what we have here is a hot potato. God bless Mr. Damon. May he find a new comfort zone and restart from there. I'll buy the disc, and that's a promise my friend. How generous and condescending of me. <br/><br/>Well, with all things considered I still love Mr. Matt Damon. As a demonstration of that I bought a Blu-ray Disc of his new Green Zone as promised. I'll give it an open minded once over some rainy day with a widely open mind. I am also going to watch all three Bourne pictures for the fourth or fifth time. I seem to have wound up owning those on DVD as well as a few others with Matt. Whatever possessed me. Love I'd say, respect and admiration. My 10/10 stands."

","Since the World Cup just ended - and it was held in South Africa this year - and since this year marks the twentieth anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison, it seems like a good time to watch Clint Eastwood's ""Invictus"". The movie focuses on Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) goal of using the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unite South Africans of all colors. Freeman plays Mandela perfectly, showing how the leader aimed to balance the wishes of both blacks and whites.<br/><br/>Even if, like me, you know practically nothing about rugby, this movie is still very enjoyable. The point is that Mandiba (Mandela's tribal name) did what he thought was the right thing to do, even at the risk of alienating one side or the other. Another focus within the movie is Springboks captain François Pienaar (Matt Damon). Having been raised under apartheid, Pienaar is not used to having a black leader, but he understands that it is his duty to help unite South Africa.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie is a little simplistic in the sense that it makes it look as nothing bad ever happened again after the 1995 World Cup, while crime, poverty and unemployment persist in South Africa to this day. But it is important to realize the role that the tournament played in showing how Nelson Mandela was serious about bringing together his entire country in a common cause, so I definitely recommend it."

I cannot comment on how close to the facts it was, as I'm not familiar with what happened (as I was only 5). <br/><br/>I will keep this review short, as I only have two things to say.<br/><br/>First, I thought while Morgan Freeman performed very well and is a phenomenal actor, I believe that the inspiration in his role was due to the great things Mandela had done and not how he portrayed Mandela. Regardless, it would not have been the same if an unknown had been casted instead.<br/><br/>Second, the rugby match was a very epic / inspirational battle and was very close as you would see in several classic sports films. But, I think that how the director portrayed the Bokke as being so horrible and even loyal fans having no hopes of making the quarter finals, and then they come from behind and win the world cup seemed unrealistic. It made the film that much more inspiring, but they made the team look too bad."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","1","20 June 2010"," Eastwood Continues to Impress
","Invictus (2009) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Another marvelous achievement for director Eastood tells the true story of the 1995 South African rugby team who went into that years World Cup, in Africa no less, and tried to pull off one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Recently elected President Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) asks captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to try and win the event not only for the upset but to bring the racial tensions of the country to an end. Eastwood has had a rather amazing run over the past couple decades and he certainly has made a name for himself among some of the greatest directors of all time. INVICTUS is what you'd call a political thriller, social drama and sports movie and we've seen each of those types of films countless times throughout the years. Even though we've seen them countless times, under Eastwood's direction we still get some fresh and original and in the end it's yet another winner for the director. What really caught me off guard was how Eastwood decided to tell the story. Yes, we get a few cliché moments but for the most part this comes off very original. You could look at all of the sports footage and say there isn't much heart or energy in the scenes. Eastwood even makes the brave decision of not explaining how rugby works as I'm sure many people watching this film have no ideas of the rules. I think this was done on purpose so that we can enjoy the sports stuff but the real heart and energy are with the people of South Africa. It's the non-sports stuff where we really feel the passion in the material and this includes a wonderfully handled sequence where the rugby team goes to the prison where Mandela spent most of his life. The scene with Damon inside his jail cell was very haunting. Even the stuff dealing with the racial tension is handled in a rather fresh and original way as the film kicks off with four black bodyguards being upset that Mandela has hired four white bodyguards. The way this sequence plays out is a fresh way of showing the racial tension and this short sequence pretty much tells us all we need to know. Another great sequence is when the rugby team is going to teach some children about the game but all the black children immediately run to the sole black player on the team. What really drives this movie home is the Oscar-nominated performance by Freeman who really does turn in one of his greatest performances here. I've heard a few people complain that he doesn't look like Mandela and that he does sound 100% like him but to me this is a mute point. What matters if the power, message and emotional power of Mandela and that's what Freeman nails. Each time he opened his mouth I couldn't help but be drawn into the power he's displaying in sheer energy. There's no screaming or shouting yet the power of the character still comes across with Freeman constantly giving off this invisible energy that will strike viewers as raw emotion and power. Damon is also very good in his role, another quiet one, that the actor really digs into and makes for a memorable character. The supporting players are all pretty much in the background but all done nice jobs. As is usual with an Eastwood film, we get a great music score full of South African music but that typical and beautiful cinematography. In the recent documentary THE EASTWOOD FACTOR, the director explains what keeps him moving and why he continues to make movies. The way he pretty much put it is that he looks for power in non-typical ways and that's pretty much what he has delivered here. We've seen countless race movies and countless sports movies but none have been quite like this. That's probably why this didn't do overly well at the box office while junk like THE BLIND SIDE wins awards and brings in cash. A shame really but this is a class act film that doesn't go for one bad cliché after another or some sort of fake drama to bring a tear."

","Clint Eastwood seems absent from this little movie until the credits at the end. What could have been a powerful little drama ends up being a volley between a hero president of South Africa and a Rugby Field. Granted we know a lot about the extraordinary Nelson Mandela and his surviving imprisonment to be released and form a government that through his inspiration brought an end to Apartheid. This little story about how he focused on encouraging a Rugby team's determination and success in winning the 1995 World Cup for Rugby and for bringing together a splintered country into a unified whole is well worth knowing, but little else happens here - we discover no insights into Nelson Mandela's character or that of his chosen inspirer François Pienaar. Clint Eastwood is usually far more sensitive and dramatic. <br/><br/>The name of the movie is taken from the 1875 poem that inspired Mandela during his years of imprisonment. And it seems appropriate to quote that full poem here: Invictus Out of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. <br/><br/>In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br/><br/>Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. <br/><br/>It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll.

The superb actor Morgan Freeman endures denture and facial make up and a shaky new accent as Nelson Mandela, but this is a flat performance - OK, but not memorable. Matt Damon obviously buffed up for his role and learned a new accent as François Pienaar and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive. The entire cast is adequate for the little they contribute. Yes, we want to love this movie and the ending does make us swell with admiration, but it is the getting there that seems an overwrought and excessive 93 minutes!

Morgan Freeman as Mandella was terrific. He played the part perfectly with the touch of charm, heart, intellect and thoughtfulness. Matt Damon was okay as Francois but I have to say it could have been played better with another actor in his place. Clint Eastwood directs once again with flair capturing the essence of the story and focusing it firmly on one event as the apartheid was more than that, which is where I feel he went slightly wrong. It would have been nice to see more of an exploration about the rise of Mandella and the wider impact of the apartheid instead of just about the world cup.<br/><br/>It was interesting and inspiring to watch though I didn't feel the inspiration until the very end. It wasn't amazing as there were parts where I was getting a bit bored but it does pick up. What did let this down slightly was Matt Damon's satisfactory but nothing more performance and lack of the powerful tone of the situation and more exploration of the wider implications of the apartheid and Mandella's biography and more inspiration surrounding it. Eastwood has failed in this sense and instead of turning into the masterpiece it could have been like Changeling, it's just very good film, which for me is not normal in his vocabulary and it is easily forgettable unlike Changeling. But it would be a shame to put this down too much as this is still well worth seeing even if it's a bit on the long side."

I trust in a filmmaker like Eastwood and indeed I think the problem of Invictus is not related with the thing that it is a period piece: the research was made (in this case, the film was based on John Carlin's Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Changed a Nation), I mean, the historical inaccuracies reported are, at least for my money, not quite important (""Johan de Villiers the TV commentator who first bad-mouths the Boks and then praises the Springboks, after the final whistle, asks the question of Pienaar: ""What did it feel like to have 62,000 fans supporting you in the stadium?"" and receives the answer: ""We didn't have 62,000 fans behind us, we had 43 million South Africans."" It was in fact a SABC reporter called David van der Sandt""). <br/><br/>So in Invictus we see facts and certainly for people who didn't much about Mandela and the game that changed a nation, people like me, it is a pretty useful film. But anyway, you don't need to be a hundred percent faithful with the facts to create a masterpiece. That said, Invictus was nothing less than a true disappointment, with many weak elements."

","I would prefer it had they chosen another angle to look at Mandela's life.<br/><br/>It was made extremely obvious in the movie that the game was a metaphor for pulling together and no longer acting in self-interest, so the 'bonding' before the games was interesting, but at the end of the day I just don't give a fig about rugby, so I didn't need to see so much onfield action. If you're going to put Mandela in a movie, then make it about him, and not how he encouraged another organisation to do his work of uniting a nation.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you appreciate movies about how sport can bring people together and hasten social change away from the playing field, then this still does stand as a decent entry into that canon."

","If ever an actor was the only choice for a role, then this is it. Morgan Freeman has one of the most commanding presences of any actor in Hollywood, and here he slips so effortlessly into the role of South African President Nelson Mandela that you have to blink twice to make sure you're not watching archival footage of the man himself. It's not an imitation so much as a habitation of the role. Matt Damon, too, does an excellent job, but he does it in a very different manner. Whereas Freeman tinkers with his preexisting screen persona in just the right way, Damon completely casts his own aside, and I frequently forgot that I was watching one of the screen's highest-paid actors. Clint Eastwood, an actor himself, has always excelled at coaxing quality performances from quality performers.<br/><br/>In the early 1990s, Nelson Mandela was released following 27 years of incarceration. His first order of business as President, if this film is to be believed, was to ensure the World Cup success of the South African rugby team. All other politics are bluntly dismissed as gratuitous international travel or distractions during a rugby game. By evoking a significant period in South African history – the end of apartheid – Eastwood tries very hard to elevate 'Invictus' above the ranks of every other predictable underdog sporting story ever made, but a simple-minded approach to politics means that he never quite escapes the pack. In its final act, all matters of racism are swept aside for a World Cup final that unfolds almost entirely in slow-motion, and, since the game's outcome is never in any doubt, the sequence drags with corresponding sluggishness."

","Enlightening, heartwarming and puts rugby where it belongs on the world stage. I thought this film had merit just on historic value but it was extremely well made and gave an insight to the events of our recent past.. I thought all the actors carried their parts well. Damon even fooled us with his accent. Freeman was superbly cast and played his role flawlessly. To my mind an Oscar winning performance. As a rugby fan I have to say some of the acting ""on the field"" was a little unrealistic. Not only did it lack the intensity and skill of the players but the ""restarts"" were completely unrealistic and obviously played by actors and not rugby players. Having said that it was a clear and accurate account of the events that actually took place. Many of the ""quotes"" and events could be taken straight from Pinaars own autobiography written after the 1995 World Cup."
"Troy_Campbell","6","0","2","21 January 2010"," Clint Eastwood's Invictus is a film of two halves.
","Excuse the sporting cliché, but Clint Eastwood's Invictus is a film of two halves. Both are entertaining – in different ways – but as a whole they don't really gel. What takes place over the first 70 minutes is a biographical drama filled with details and anecdotes suitably interesting for the subject matter at hand – one of the most famous political figures and world leaders in history – with the focus primarily on Mandela and his acquaintance with Pienaar. However we also see how his black security team reluctantly interact with the newly appointed - by Mandela himself – white security team, how his closest political advisors are not quite sure of his 'ready-to-forgive' approach and how Pienaar struggled to gain the high moral standards of his predominantly white side. All very intriguing, all very absorbing. Alas all ending just after the midway point.<br/><br/>When kickoff for the second half takes place the picture shifts into casual 'sports-film' mode akin to For Love of the Game, The Longest Yard, etc. All the dramatic and personal touches we have become engrossed in disappear and are replaced by the Springbok's road to redemption at Rugby Union's pinnacle of tournaments; complete with group runs early in the morning, a rain-soaked semis match and a seemingly unbeatable opponent in the grand final. It's mostly tense, despite knowing the results already, and the action on the field is shot nicely (though not packing the same punch theatrically as American Football), however Mandela becomes a mere sidenote and is relegated to reaction shots sitting in the stands. You may enjoy the second part – I did for the majority – but you'll find it hard to shake the feeling it isn't the direction you wanted the film to take.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that Morgan Freeman makes a formidably realistic Mandela. His physical resemblance aside, Freeman adopts the mental and emotional level with ease and provides the gravitas a man like Mandela deserves on screen. Surprisingly, Matt Damon's performance matches that of Freeman's; he is quietly powerful and moving as the lesser known Pienaar. Thankfully his accent isn't overdone, a common misstep for American actors when portraying a native from the south of the African continent.<br/><br/>Separately the cinematically-varied halves are great, together they sail wide of the upright.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","It will be interesting to see if this movie has universal appeal, particularly in USA where Rugby is confined to colleges mostly on the west coast. The thread of the story of course was more about Mandela's wish to find a way for uniting the country through sport and this came across quite well along with the scepticism on both sides of the political divide and the mistrust of the new administration. Personally I thought the sequences of the Rugby went on a little long although they were reasonably well done. The question remains though, would the film have been made had the result of the game been different? Character development was not strong apart from the Mandela character.Matt Damon was fairly convincing but the film, for me at least, failed to reach the heights of other recent Eastwood films. I am sure the film will have a large audience in South Africa and to a lesser degree other Rugby playing nations."
"Aguas","7","0","2","14 December 2009"," Wonderfully acted and shot, if not exceedingly long and under edited
","Solid performances from both Damon and Eastwood (director) and an excellent portrayal by Freeman. ""Invictus"" looks at the issues faced by the new government in post apartheid South Africa and one of the ways, support of the ""White"" Rugby team, that Nelson Mandela tries to heal the country. Freeman is very convincing in his role, maybe because he finally plays a role closer to his age, as Nelson Mandela. He exudes leadership and understanding. Damon plays the Rugby team Captain that presses his team to continue their quest for a rugby championship despite the distractions of the time. His performance is good but not great as he doesn't really show any range on emotions. The final piece of the triangle is Clint Eastwood. He continues his exploration of important contemporary topics and gives us the expected excellent cinematography. Where he lets down the audience is in the editing. Many scenes are much longer than required and summation makes the movie a half hour longer than it needed to be to achieve the desired end. Good movie, but I would wait for it on DVD."
