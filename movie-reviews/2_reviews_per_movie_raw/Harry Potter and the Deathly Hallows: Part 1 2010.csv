","Up until now, I was convinced that from the 4th book onwards, Harry Potter-books had become too complex to make into film: Goblet of Fire was a sore disappointment. Order of the Phoenix left many Potterheads wanting more, even if it wasn't a bad film per se (personally I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I felt they left out too much). Half-blood Prince -while visually stunning- did not capture the brilliance of the book. With ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", I think the makers have finally succeeded in crafting a movie that was both fun to watch for casual viewers while also catering to the needs of the hard-core fans who know the books by heart. The decision to split the movie into two parts may be judged as a financial one by some, but I'm convinced it was the only possible way to make this work. The movie was cut off at the perfect time as well, having the viewers yearn for more without being too abrupt.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away anything, so I'll just say this: Hats of to you, David Yates. One can only hope the second installment will continue in the same vein..."
"moviexclusive","9","204","287","16 November 2010"," Dark and thrilling, this prelude packs genuine suspense, heart and the occasional exhilarating action to deliver an engrossing magical spectacle
","A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate instalment of Harry Potter. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. <br/><br/>Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. <br/><br/>There are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a dizzyingly exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie. <br/><br/>Indeed, naysayers who think David Yates doesn't know how to stage thrilling action sequences should think again, as he demonstrates amply that he is just as capable when it comes to staging them. He also displays an uncanny knack for milking suspense out of scenes- in particular, Harry, Hermoine and Ron's daring raid on the Ministry of Magic and their subsequent visit to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and home to Bathilda Bagshot, a magician and dear friend to Dumbledore. These brim with nail-biting tension, and Yates plays them out nicely to set your pulse racing at the end. <br/><br/>The crux of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry, Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak English countryside on their quest to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes. On the run from Voldemort, the trio find the immensity of their journey taking a toll on them. Harry and Ron's friendship begins to fray as Ron grows suspect of Hermoine's affections for Harry. Meanwhile, Harry can barely conceal his frustration with getting no headway and starts losing his temper at Ron. <br/><br/>Infused with a profound sense of isolation and loss, this middle stretch in the film may be tedious for some impatient viewers, but fans will be rewarded with probably the richest depiction of the relationships between the characters since the first two movies. One scene where Harry and Hermoine suddenly decide to dance together to the tune of Nick Cave's The Children playing on the radio is lyrical in its depiction of their desperate attempt to find levity in a world that affords none. Yes, their friendship strong and deep since the beginning will be tested, and Yates delivers an emotional payoff towards the end of the film that is truly poignant. <br/><br/>Thanks to the decision to split the final book into two films, Yates doesn't hurry through these scenes. Instead, he allows the audience to experience the frustration, jealousy and uncertainty of his characters, and allows for Radcliffe, Watson and Grint to display some fine acting with the minimalest distraction from any visual effects. The additional time also turns out to be a blessing for fans and audiences, allowing them the opportunity to see their favourite supporting characters back on screen- most prominently of course Dobby the elf who returns to give the movie a touching finale. <br/><br/>Amidst the gloom, screenwriter Steve Kloves again provides for rare welcome moments of levity. Harry's escort mission is aided by magical decoys of Harry, one of them wearing a bra. To get to the Ministry of Magic, one needs to flush oneself down a toilet bowl. These occasional sparks of humour enliven a film that is otherwise ominous and menacing. Kloves however fumbles slightly with the lengthy expository, and those who have not read the book will find themselves struggling to catch up with the significance of certain characters (e.g. Sirius' brother, Regulus Arcturus Black) and certain events (e.g. Bathilda turning into a slithering serpent). <br/><br/>Still Kloves never had an enviable task to begin with, and Yates- at his most confident here- guides the proceedings along admirably, unfolding them briskly at the start, then settling in for a deliberately measured pace and finally picking up speed for as much as a climax as this first- parter can have. His assuredness also shows in his artistic choices, especially a wayang-kulit-like animated sequence telling the story of the Deathly Hallows. <br/><br/>Though we know better than to expect the grand showdown between Harry and Voldemort by the end of the film, there is still a distinct sense that what we have seen so far is only a build-up for something bigger and far more astounding. But even as a prelude, this seventh film is notable in its own right, a tense and thrilling experience darker, scarier and more mature than any of its predecessors"
"Naurya","9","180","258","17 November 2010"," A grown-up movie that fits a grown-up Potter
","After having seen HP6, I honestly didn't have great expectations in this one. I guessed it would be darker and scarier, as every HP movie has been darker and scarier than its predecessor. But HP6 was such a patchwork of scenes that didn't give you the feeling of a coherent work - I was afraid the even more complex story line of HP7 would make an even less coherent movie. However, I must say it was definitely a wise decision to split the 7th book into 2 movies. HP7 can take time to explain and introduce all the characters that are necessary to the plot.<br/><br/>I love the way Voldemort and the Death Eaters are portrayed in this movie. They are no longer just anonymous caped figures. You can see them interacting with each other, discussing and well... being human. Well, I'm always a big fan of the blurring of these clearcut good/evil categories in Fantasy.<br/><br/>As the book is split into 2 parts, all of a sudden, there's also time for little embellishments I hadn't realized I had missed in the earlier movies! For example, I loved the scene so much where the feather floated through the air when the fairy tale of the Three Brothers was being told. Also the drawing style that was used during the story was really amazing. This HP movie was the first of all that finally gave me the same feeling as Lord of the Rings did: Boy, this is not just some guys slavishly adapting a book into a movie, but they're actually autonomous artists and they have ideas of their own! And I don't mean they changed the whole plot (I wouldn't like that)! But (mostly visually) they did more than just bring across what's in the book.<br/><br/>This also expresses itself in the decision not to include the childish Harry Potter musical theme (at least I didn't hear it, correct me if I'm wrong) from the first movie that sounds like ""Wow, everything's so magical here!"" That tune was fine for the first movie, but as Harry got older and the movies got darker, it kind of felt like they had to force this theme into every movie several times even though it didn't really fit any more. Now the soundtrack, too, has finally grown up. And I loved it! Last but not least, the acting was brilliant! The tense atmosphere between Harry, Ron and Hermione really came across. Also with all the doppelg√§nger scenes, you always still saw from their movements and behaviour which character was which though they were in disguise in a different body.<br/><br/>All in all, as the title says, this is a excellent grown-up movie and I can recommend it to everyone - except kids! If you have little kids, please don't take them. This movie has far too many scary scenes and little comic relief! Plus, the plot is quit complex including lots and lots of minor characters. It's really no longer a movie targeted at kids, even though it's still labelled ""Harry Potter""."
"dvc5159","7","242","359","16 November 2010"," A strong beginning to a grand finale. The best film of the franchise so far.
","It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one, if they haven't read the books already.<br/><br/>With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years (and films) progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody.<br/><br/>I won't waste time trying to talk about the performances, because they are all great and powerful in their own way. Never mind that many of the cast members are very talented veteran British actors (try getting John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, Jason Isaacs and Bill Nighy in the same film again) - the three young actors who we have come to love and care for following the first film a decade ago, basically carry the franchise on their shoulders, and this film is no exception. Radcliffe looks handsome, Grint looks gruff, and Watson looks gorgeous. They've grown into fine young people.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Steve Kloves doesn't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds, but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it. Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle, but also a character-driven ensemble; there's some complex characterization here. Also there's some action which aren't seen on screen, but mentioned by the characters. It's OK, because it's necessary for the brisk pacing, and it's not really that important anyways. Besides, the human mind can imagine these images far more powerfully.<br/><br/>There are many themes in this film. Sacrifice, determination, (obviously) friendship, and above all - acceptance. As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum - signaling that all hope may be lost. But in the end, will good triumph over evil? Like the film, real life isn't so sure. Also, the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films - it's also another way of acceptance - the films have ended, they're moving on for the better of their lives/careers. It's real life, and I wish all these promising young actors brilliant lives and careers ahead of them.<br/><br/>""Hallows: Part I"" is many parts thrilling, as there are quite a number of intense action sequences. Many of them, of course, are done with well-rendered visual effects, and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring. However, the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping, dramatic moments. They don't feel heavy handed and it's beautiful to look at. The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jaw-droppingly beautiful to both watch and listen. If separated by itself it can win an Oscar for best animated short. <br/><br/>The crew also get their due here. David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago. The cinematography is stunning and exquisite, and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film. The editing is also crisp, it's not choppy when it doesn't need to be. Alexandre Desplat's score really makes a difference, it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful, harmonious, and emotional tones.<br/><br/>In short, I would have to say that this film is the best ""Harry Potter: film yet in all honesty. I grew up with the series, and as per the actors, it will be an emotional goodbye. But rest assured, the finale will be grand.<br/><br/>One more thing. This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet. The novel is done justice, something not seen since the first three films. It's something for both the fans and novel-readers alike, as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film. It's definitely a huge improvement over ""Half-Blood Prince""'s adaptation, which for me is the worst Potter film.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a phenomenon. But, like all things, it most come to an end eventually. This is the beginning of the end, and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 75/100<br/><br/>P.S.:Eat your hearts out, Twi-hards."
"JeronimusW","10","98","142","13 November 2010"," How glad I am, that this film is so different
","""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" follows the book closely, but misses out on a few interesting scenes, and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome. <br/><br/>In the beginning, it seems like the film's skipping through the book's content very quickly, but it makes sense, when you realise how much is going on. At the end, the beginning is far away, although the journey there doesn't make it seem like a long while. <br/><br/>General opinion seems to be that it drags in the middle, but, let's face it, so did the book. There's no real reason to complain about Endless Camping Trips at all, because the film moves from plot point to set piece to plot point all the time. There's some clever ways the film handles its exposition, although it is not without its faults. <br/><br/>The trio's acting is the second best thing in this film. Emma has improved loads over the past few years, and she seems to be at the top of her game in this film. Her acting is stellar. As usual, Grint gets saddled with the role of comic relief, but he also gets his chance to shine in an array of emotional scenes. Daniel manages to carry the story as the main character. The three manage to stand their own very well without the presence of the adult actors.<br/><br/>Speaking of adult actors, Nick Morran's Scabior is a delightful character - he's slightly perverted and he has a bit of a Jack Sparrow vibe going on. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was impressive and managed to be quite threatening. It is a shame that we see so little of Bill Nighy's character, the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. The character was regrettably cut from the previous film, and I wish they hadn't, if only to see more of Nighy's impressive performance. Old-time familiar faces are great, as usual. Fiona Shaw gets but one shot of screen time, but the look in her eyes says so much about her character. Jasoon Isaacs is terrific as a broken and devastated Lucius Malfoy. The lack of Rickman is a shame, but the presence of Bonham Carter makes up for it. Big baddie Ralph Fiennes manages to finally be a menacing, scary Voldemort in the film's first scenes, but as the story progresses and he gets appearances in a few messy, rushed and disappointing visions, Voldemort's actions just don't continue being an ominous cloud of danger, as they should be. <br/><br/>The film's greatest achievement, however, is the animated sequence detailing the ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", an interesting wizard fairytale. It is a daring move from the filmmakers, one that will pleasantly surprise the audience.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown is how the film doesn't just keep going. After two-and-a-half hours, it doesn't feel like the story's finished. A few scenes were added to make the climax more exciting, but it's just a downright shame that the movie doesn't just continue for another hour or two."
"Pegapus","7","41","56","19 November 2010"," Overly melodramatic at times, a roller coaster ride with highs, and lows, but very little middle ground.
","I confess. I read the book about a dozen times in the past few years. It's not like I don't do anything else, but I do. In a year, I probably get through about 25-30 books. So reading HP and the DH was just something I was enjoying. There are clues in various places in the books, and you just have to marvel at how Jo Rowling tied up all the ends so nicely in the last one.<br/><br/>The one thing, though, that I felt was off in 7 was how she portrayed Hagrid. In a few cases, it seemed like she was treating him like a buffoon, but that's a personal opinion, not something that critically could be considered wrong with the book.<br/><br/>But the last book kept elements close together. It brought in all the old characters, added a few new ones, but basically held together things with bonds of steel. The relationships were both old and new, with a true feeling of family and friendships. And we all celebrated the good times in the book and lamented the bad times.<br/><br/>So when Mad-Eye Moody gets killed so early in the book, a feeling of loss goes with him. When Fleur is so happy to be marrying Bill, we're all happy for them both. When we see Kreacher turn from a foul house-elf to a fine house-servant, we're happy for him. When Tonks tells us she is pregnant, we celebrate! But almost none of that is in the movie. We know instinctively that those things happened in the book, but if you haven't read them, you're going to go WTF? an awful lot.<br/><br/>Mad-Eye is killed in the chase, but there isn't a toast to this memory. When Fleur is so intense about the wedding, we see no real emotion, but for one brief moment. When the trio leaves Kreacher for their exploits at the ministry, we have no idea how much he has changed. And when Tonks and Lupin go off, there is nothing to suggest the very sad and aching love they have for each other, and about Remus's hesitation about his upcoming fatherhood.<br/><br/>There is no investment in these characters in the film. It's like ""strip the souls from everyone but Ron, Harry and Hermione, make the others more melodramatic with no attachment to the real story, and voil√†! you have Deathly Hallows Part One."" I confess: I don't like David Yates' direction. There has been something off about it since OOTP, though I might be one of the few who think that. I think his often amateurish direction is quite obvious in this film. The film is often like a roller coaster, with giddy high points, either in the action or the tone, but there are also many very low points, and there is nothing in the middle. We don't LEARN anything from the characters--we follow them on their journey, yes, but we have to inject too much of the overall plot from the book to see what has been left out, and what is still present. There are times when a collage filming of the many places the trio (and in the middle, the duo) went could get that section speeded up without weighing it down (a friend with me found the middle WAY too slow), and at times, a more polished director could have found ways to make the scenes pack a lot more information into them. It certainly didn't look like the kids weren't eating a whole lot, or how much Hermione actually fit into her small pocketbook. The scene that could have managed that would have been the scene in the book where Hermione packs the full sized painting of Sirius Black's relative, Phinea Black, former headmaster of Hogwarts, into her bag. But it was not to be.<br/><br/>I think if there had been a consistent tone during the film, it would have helped bring a more cohesive tone to the film, interlocking all the elements into one. But there wasn't that kind of a feeling in it, and I am disappointed that it didn't happen.<br/><br/>I might be one of the very few fans who feels the film wasn't a very good one. Yes, it's only half of a whole, and the second half might be a totally different one, emotionally, and dramatically. But I just need to say to fans, go with the warning that there are a lot of faults with this installment, and accept it just as a nice visual film, with very, very little to do with the entire HP legacy. It probably won't help, and you will be filling in the blanks from the books, but it's certainly better than nothing."
"MovieGeekBlog","8","66","95","16 November 2010"," This gets better and better. Let's get ready for the final one!!
","Right from the very start, when the Warner Bros logo appears, this film feels different. The colours are gray and muted, the sound is a low rumble and even the famous theme from John Williams seems to have given way to a much darker drone. It doesn't even feel like a Harry Potter movie anymore. It makes the first Chris Columbus movies feel like they are from a whole different universe. And this feeling stayed with me right until the end¬Ö For the last few instalments of the series (possibly from number 3 onwards) we've been hearing a lot of ""this one is darker"" type of lines being bantered about, whether from the critics, the fans or even the film-makers themselves. But it's never been more true than in this final chapter.<br/><br/>And yet, this is not just a darker and scarier film, it is also a much more mature one too. It's as if the film-makers have grown together with their viewers (who are now 10 years older than they were when the first movie got released) A few years ago, when we first heard about the fact that the seventh and final book was going to be divided into two films, we all cynically thought straight away: ""They really want to squeeze every single penny out of this last one, those greedy people"". And I am sure that must have been one of the reasons, however director David Yates has been able to take advantage of this extra time to give the story a certain amount of depth, sophistication and gravitas that was missing from all the previous instalments.<br/><br/>The pace is a lot slower, for a start. Of course, you get some cracking action scenes too (a particular good one through the Dartfor Tunnel), some great visuals, whether just the perfect vistas and landscapes, the inventive special effects (the scene, in the trailer too, where there are about 8 different Potters, is all done in one perfect 360 degree shot) and there's even a beautiful short animation sequence (where ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"", is shown as a shadow-play and that by itself should almost be nominated for an Oscar for BEST animated short), but the real core of the movie this time are actually the 3 main characters. Their dialogue scenes take centre stage and are played in the most realistic possible way, with long silences, pauses and meaningful looks.<br/><br/>Even the music is a lot more subtle and understated, aside from being of course a lot darker. There's a particular chase scene in a forest towards the second half of the movie, where unexpectedly, they decided not to play any music at all, just letting the sound effects play through: that is very very unusual for a blockbuster of this calibre.<br/><br/>The film bravely takes a lot of risks, on one hand, by veering away from what kids are probably expecting, but at the same time it'll give fans a real treat (and it might even change the minds of some of those Harry Potter haters)! It is a film about emotions, about characters, about friendship first and foremost and it all happens to take place in a magical world. It's what every single avid Harry Potter reader has been waiting for years.<br/><br/>In a way, the mood of the film is much closer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, not just in the muted colours of the landscape, or in the grittier looks of the characters (even Harry Potter looks dirtier this time and has even got a bit of a beard!), but in the way it's paced and constructed.<br/><br/>It's essentially a road movie (it's also the first film to be Hogward-free. We only get one quick glimpse of the train going to the school, but that's about it). There are much fewer laughs throughout and most of them come from Ron (Rupert Grint), but somehow when they do come, they seem to work a lot better than they ever did. Maybe because the whole film is so tense that you are just craving for a moment to relax let the tension fade. And this is by no means a criticism, in fact, quite the opposite.<br/><br/>By all means, this isn't a masterpiece. For all the tension, the great atmosphere and all the brave intentions, there are some slightly clunky moments here and there too. For example the scene where Ron comes back and rejoins the group, feels a bit ""out of the blue"" and could have been handled in a better way. Also some of the dialogue doesn't quite ring true and too many characters come in and out like bell-boys in a hotel. But it's interesting to notice how most of the stuff that doesn't quite work in the film, has actually been lifted straight from the books. I think once again the film exposes the weaknesses of the book (which c'mon let's face it, however gripping, it wasn't really a great piece of writing. I loved it, in fact I loved the whole series, but I recognise its limits).<br/><br/>It's good to see them trying something different. It's good to see them slowing down a bit and taking good care of their characters. It's good to see them trying to be more mature and stir away from cheesy clich√©s. I can see why this is JK Rowling's favourite movie.<br/><br/>I was happy with it too¬Ö but then again, I love Harry Potter, so I am probably biased.<br/><br/>Summer 2011 cannot be here soon enough. And after that? Oh dear, I am already so sad that it's all going to be over¬Ö <br/><br/>See the full review here http://wp.me/p19wJ2-3v"

","I missed out on seeing this at the cinemas, and although the experience would have been undeniably better if I had seen it there first as opposed to from my living room sofa, I'm kind of glad that I didn't bother. I have read the books and seen the other films countless times, and even the later, darker ones are still enchanting and heart-warming. This one, however left me completely cold. Most of the film is flat and dull, with none of the charm and detail of the book and as much as I usually love the actors, I didn't feel any connection to the characters. After all the hype and success of the other films, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I was a big disappointment. I can only hope that Part II makes up for it."
"tomgillespie2002","5","5","5","27 July 2014"," It's like everyone forgot this series was supposed to be fun
","And so here it is finally. After nine years watching the prepubescent speccy wizard grow into a chiselled speccy wizard, the long, long climax is here. Kicking off what has become a fad in novel adaptations aimed mainly at screaming teenage girls (Twilight, The Hunger Games), Deathly Hallows splits the final novel into two 120-plus films. Whether this is to avoid condensing a mammoth, multi-character into one rushed, incoherent stand-alone movie, or to take full advantage of a multi- billion franchise that is soon to finally end, is up for debate (although a sneaky feeling tells me it's the latter). What is for certain is that a huge, dragging chunk of Part 1 could have easily been wavered. It's like director David Yates forgot that this series is supposed to be fun.<br/><br/>This time around, there's no Hogwarts, and there's almost nothing recognisable about the franchise whatsoever. Beginning with an exciting broomstick battle over London which sees surviving members of the Order don Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) face in an attempt to elude the lurking Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), things soon turn gloomy as Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are forced to go solo in the countryside in search of the Dark Lord's remaining Horcruxes. If that word perplexes you at this point of the series, you may as well leave early, as quite rightly, the film has no time for catch-up.<br/><br/>With the novel going into much-needed detail in terms of character, background and plot (such is the benefit of literature), the decision to split the film into two parts means Part 1 can breathe easy and take it's time before the final smackdown at Hogwarts in Part 2. This means we spend more time with the three leads as the weight of possible doom lingers heavy on their backs. The absence of the usual stellar adult ensemble is damaging, as Radcliffe, Grint and Watson struggle to hold the film on their own, given their limited acting ability and their character's lack of any real dimension. Grint is easily the best of the three, but Ron is shackled with a jealousy sub-plot (again) which means he gets to mope a lot and storm off.<br/><br/>Yates is the safe choice at this point to end the series. He lacks the cuddly obviousness of Chris Columbus and the more visionary efforts of Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell, and apart from a nice little animated sequence near the middle, the film just goes through the motions. There's a nice little dance number, but it's the only recognisable touch from the director. ""These are dark times, there's no denying it,"" warns Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), the new minister of magic, in the film's opening scene. Dark and grainy times they are, and oddly joyless, Part 1 feels like an extended advertisement for the real end, Part 2, squeezing it's dedicated fans for all they're worth.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"louisekraz","4","131","208","20 November 2010"," Surprise: This is NOT a Harry Potter movie
","This is not a Harry Potter movie. It is a movie that has characters with the same names and faces but they are in an alternative universe, one created by David Yates starting in movie 5. In that universe, all the themes and ideas developed in the book-based Harry Potter mythology are gone. In its place is a story about an individual boy wizard and his teen friends. What happened to the great choices Harry has to make, like does he go after the Horcruxes as Dumbledore instructed or does he get sidetracked looking for the Deathly Hallows? Horcruxes are thrown in as a McGuffin, an excuse to take a group camping trip rather than as the key to the whole mystery: how do you destroy evil without destroying yourself. The Hallows are the great temptation that the animation in this movie beautifully suggests but then they are completely ignored for the rest of the movies. Remember that Dumbledore and Gregorovich once had a notion of ""The Greater Good"" and that idea did not die with the end of their friendship. Dumbledore tried to teach Harry that what he was doing was not for himself, it was for the greater good of all beings, not just pure-bloods, and certainly not just for teenagers. Okay, did you get any of this from this movie? NO, because it has all been washed out of the story and replaced with silly teen anxieties and individual relationships. How very sad."
"harishkumar_0707","10","55","83","16 November 2010"," Best movie in the series.. Cant wait for the Grand Finale!!!
","Growing up with a series, especially a fantasy can be quite an intimate experience. Gratifying because of the spectacular adventures it unfolds, changing its course through the years, as well as heartbreaking for it's not permanent. After all, what can be more emotional than seeing the improbable turn true even if it's just a timeless tale of good vs evil told with a bright new perspective in a fictional universe around ingenious characters and creatures.. <br/><br/>What's great about this film is that we feel the emotions the characters go through, probably because this movie follows the book very closely. The actors have all grown up and have given memorable performances and i have to add Emma Watson looks truly ravishing.Now Some of the coolest sequences involve a jaw-dropping chase between the death eaters and multiple Harry Potters, the troika's disguised entry and escape from the Ministry of Magic in a bid to steal Salazar Slytherin's locket ,a brilliantly animated interlude narrating 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' and Nagini's petrifying assault on a shell-shocked Harry. Thankfully, all this, especially the last mentioned bit, does not occur in 3D as previously planned. Be warned, not everyone has the stomach to endure the furious thrills that follow every time Voldemort's enormous snake makes an appearance.<br/><br/>And while Voldemort himself only shows up during the first and final scene, his towering baritone and intimidating personality more than make up for the break. Fiennes conducts the foul-faced antagonist with such exquisite terror and theatrical charisma; he's assured to earn a seat in the realm of cinema's greatest villains. <br/><br/>Now I eagerly await the last part of the series,I'm sure it'll be sad for millions of fans when they bid farewell to this epic and memorable series. Harry, Ron and Hermoine will be forever etched in our minds."
"ihazhart","1","146","239","13 January 2011"," Harry Potter & the Movie of Beautiful Scenery and Not Much Else (also knows as Harry Potter goes Camping!)
","*complete spoilers*<br/><br/>The first scenes went something like this: Everyone drinks a nasty potion that makes them look like Harry and they get undressed on camera spouting anti-climatic, fast-paced jokes. Then in what *should* have been an exciting chase-scene, Hedwig plummets to her death. Harry is traumatized. Later he learns Mad-Eyes also died and, not giving him much thought, 'zips Ginny up' in and abrupt oh-so-passionate-scene with as much charisma and heart as a toaster.<br/><br/>Harry then meets a witch who tells him bad things about Dumbledore which he instantly believes even though he's known her for all of, what, ten seconds, and Harry falls into a depression. Kinsgley warns the wedding party (oops, I forget to mention. Ron's brother Bill is getting married. y'know, Bill? That one Weasley child no one ever mentioned or casted? Him.) So, anyways, Voldemort took over the ministry (how exactly we'll never know) and is coming to kill everyone harry cares about (like Ginny. he does care about her y'know. they had their first love scene which lasted five seconds and was witness by George, who had a toothbrush in his ear.) <br/><br/>So Harry, Hermione, and Ron run away because Hermione is a flipping genius who always saves their butts with advanced magic and bottomless purses.<br/><br/>Okay. The action stops here.<br/><br/>Now we are privileged to enjoy stunning landscapes and breathtaking landscapes of famous places all around the UK where the dynamic trio (make that duo: Ron leaves) set up camp. The audience is delighted to be separated from the rest of the plot and action-packed, intense moments happening in the outside world, and instead can focus their attention on the beauty of a certain tree that harry and Hermione are sitting under and discussing the evils of Dumbledore, the man who ruined everything.<br/><br/>Hermione finds a doodle in a book and Harry and Hermione determine it MUST be a hint in a Blue's-Clues like moment of epiphany. Ignoring their new sense of purpose (besides finding lovely lakes to vacation by) Harry risks it all to return to Godric's Hollw and is there (unwittingly) attacked by a snake...lady...thing. They escape (Hermione, cough, cough) and return to their picturesque campsite.<br/><br/>In the middle of the night Harry sees a patronus and, since of course NO ONE wants to kill him, deceive him, maul him, etc. He follows it like a complete nitwit. Luckily his hunch is correct and he arrives at a frozen lake, undresses, and takes a dip. A dark locket proceeds to choke him (why it couldn't choke him above-water, I haven't the faintest idea) but Harry is saved by Ron, who also manages to get his shirt off. With the sword of Godric, the two (still wet) decide to destroy the locket that so fiendishly attempted to strangle Harry (naughty object of darkness and evil).<br/><br/>And then...Ron bears witness to a porn scene between Harry and Hermione who are inexplicably making out naked. (It is a very emotional scene.) Ron, fighting past the ridiculous apparition, smashes the locket to a million pieces and Harry and Ron return to Hermione and Ron spews some nonsense about a bubble of light in his heart.<br/><br/>The three reunited, they reluctantly leave their gorgeous campgrounds to track down a madman in hopes of finding out the mysterious meaning of Dumbledore's Doodle. The madman is only too happy to oblige and tells them it is a very important symbol of a fairy tale, so now that they have this info their problems are over. Next the audience is treated to a Tim-Burton-like animated retelling of said fairy tale that TOTALLY goes with the movie (not). The madman then attempts to capture them but they escape (Hermione COUGH COUGH) but are captured by icky ""men"" who seem more interested in Hermione than in getting a reward for Harry Potter. The Icky ""Men"" take the trio to where Voldemort lives but Voldemort is away for the time being and will return momentarily, in the mean time won't you have a seat in this lovely damp prison cell while Bellatrix attempts to torture Hermione by biting her neck or whatever it is that she's doing?<br/><br/>Voldemort doesn't show up (it's a *very* long holiday he's taking and he can't be disturbed) but Dobby does. Dobby's voice has undergone reverse-puberty, but that doesn't matter because Dobby has come to save Harry Potter because Dobby can materialize in and out of places, even the dark Lord's secret hideout.<br/><br/>So Dobby rescues them (Luna and a Goblin in addition to the trio. Her dad was the madman I'm afraid. Yes, sad really how family units are organized.) Anyhow, Bellatrix stands there watching them escape and at the last moment throws a good-old-fashioned dagger into the air where they're disappearing and when they come out the other end Dobby says some lame last words in a girly voice and perishes, with Harry crying unconvincingly. Fade to black and Voldemort pops up (who's taken the failed capture of his worst enemy rather well, given the circumstances) and desecrates Dumbledore's tomb (and Dumbledore is amazingly fresh and un-decomposed) and takes Dumbledore's wand. He shoots a random red flare into the sky that serves no purpose whatsoever and the credits roll. Finally.<br/><br/>Part 2. How exciting!"
"colinrgeorge","5","34","50","22 November 2010"," Deathly Hollow
","Even having read every ""Harry Potter"" book and seen every ""Harry Potter"" film, I still hesitate to call myself a fan. It isn't that I don't enjoy the world J.K. Rowling invented or the characters she created, but rather that my enjoyment of the series has always been transient. With sometimes years between each subsequent release, my memory of the litany of events preceding them is often shaky at best, and I've never felt particularly inclined to re-visit.<br/><br/>Inasmuch, every ""Harry Potter"" has been almost an insular experience for me. I enjoyed the film series as pure Hollywood spectacle, but have always felt their independent merits were questionable at best. In that regard (taking into account I haven't seen ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" since I was in high school) ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" may be the weakest in the series. Curiously, in others ways, it's the best.<br/><br/>I love that director David Yates pumps the breaks for this adaptation‚Äîthat he actually gives the material breathing room, allowing it to be more than a feature-length amusement park ride. On a technical and artistic level, there is a lot I admire about his team's work on this penultimate adventure. But at two and a half hours, covering only half a book, there's no getting around the fact that ""Deathly Hallows"" is perhaps the least exciting and inherently least complete-feeling film in the franchise.<br/><br/>I get it, Warner Brothers. Splitting the final ""Harry Potter"" into two parts was a brilliant marketing decision. It's hard to lie down and watch a cash cow die, and I'm sure many consumers will even relish the grandeur of a two-part finale. From a creative perspective, however, Rowling's ""Deathly Hallows"" might be the worst book in the series to divide.<br/><br/>The bloated first half of her novel features a few action sequences peppered in out of necessity, but Rowling's authorial stalling is what translates most clearly in this film. Painfully little transpires, rendering probably the most faithful adaptation of her work as the weakest cinematically. Of course, Potter portrayer Daniel Radcliff and co. do as admiral a job as always in breathing life into the characters and humanizing the often absurd plot developments and plethora of plot-holes a magic world entails, but nothing can save ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" from feeling like half of a story‚Äîor more precisely, one eighth of a story.<br/><br/>Unlike prior ""Potter"" outings, ""Deathly Hallows"" also over-relies on the hunting of mystical artifacts. Major story arcs and characters are ignored in favor of horcruxes‚Äîtrinkets imbued with pieces of Voldemort's soul that Harry must seek and destroy before their climactic confrontation. The titular deathly hallows are then yet another collection of requisite magic items; between the hallows and the horcruxes, ""Harry Potter 7"" feels like one tedious fetch- quest.<br/><br/>That may be enough to satiate some Pottermaniacs, but even having read every book and seen every film, I'm not devoted enough to the franchise to overlook that ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a shameless cash-grab. It's a film almost inappreciable when considered on its own, and unexciting when compared to its prequels. There is no reason Rowling's last ""Harry Potter"" book (which is not the longest in the series) couldn't have been concisely and effectively wrapped up in two and a half hours, and asking audiences to pay twice for one film strikes me as more than a little unfair. ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a colossal tease‚Äîcrippled on its own and treading water in context, its never more than half a film. It's only fair it get half a score."
"neji107","7","130","214","15 November 2010"," A big improvement in the series!
","In my mind, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along: gritty, emotional, and cinematic. I haven't been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date, but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the ""children's fantasy"" genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book: hopelessness and desperation. <br/><br/>After the death of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the magical world falls into disarray as Voldemort gains power over the Ministry of Magic and hunts tirelessly after his mortal enemy and our continuing protagonist, Harry Potter. While keeping a low cover, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine decide to track down and destroy Voldemort's soul contained in hidden ""horcruxes"" but have difficulties deciding what to do and where to start.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows very successfully portrays the despair-filled journey of the wizarding trio. With dark undertones running through the cinematography, Part 1 of the Harry Potter finale is the film that deals more with the emotional stagnation of the characters and spends less time with action scenes and major plot points. Since Rowling's seventh book is separated into two movies, Part 1 boasts a much slower pace than earlier HP films and is not so focused on cramming as many subplots and side-stories from the book as possible into the movie's runtime, which tends to clutter up the storyline and make the whole thing feel rushed. <br/><br/>But where the slow pacing makes this film stand out in the series, it also may be its downfall. The Deathly Hallows continually feeds us a feeling of desolation as Harry, Ron and Hermoine fail to discover a way to destroy the horcruxes; they seem to be making no progress towards defeating the Dark Lord, but as an effect the movie seems to be making no progress towards an ending. Storyline lags intensely towards the middle of the film and is dragged out until the conclusion (which ends abruptly). You'll be left in your seats feeling like this is going nowhere- but that's the point: Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are getting nowhere. So I liked this movie because the pace was slow, but I also didn't like this movie because the pace was slow. See what I'm getting at? Aside from that, I can't complain much. Performances were fine, effects were impressive, and best of all, nothing dastardly was done to J.K. Rowling's story.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a nice improvement and a fine addition to the Harry Potter series and should serve as a solid emotional base for Part 2 to take off with next year. If you've enjoyed the HP movies so far, this should be a satisfying experience at least. If not, let the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 redeem your faith in the series. 7/10<br/><br/>P.S. Keep on the lookout for the scene about the deathly hallows story. It has some of the most beautiful and artistic animation I have ever seen in a movie."
"monogatari82","10","135","223","16 November 2010"," Fairly loyal to the book
","I just got home from watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I will try not to give any spoilers, but I thought it was one of the best movies yet. I thought moreover that it was fairly loyal to the book for once, as far as it was possible. I thought the tension build up was very good throughout the movie, I liked seeing the characters being slightly more matured. There are some new kind of 'special effects' in the movie, which was kind of weird to me at first, but I guess it fitted the story. I can't wait to see part two , even though I know what will happen.<br/><br/>I will not tell you anymore, but it is definitely worthy to see it in the cinema:)"
"DICK STEEL","10","155","263","17 November 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
","This is not a run of the mill series, but something which has been intricately planned for from almost the very beginning. With the last few films crafting the level of suspense into a crescendo, where each film augments the impending doom and gloom culminating in the finale seen in The Half Blood Prince, things get a lot worst here from the start, where The Deathly Hallows begins with a grim reminder from the Minister of Magic, before we see Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his ghastly lieutenants plot to take over both realms Muggle or not in quite Fascist terms.<br/><br/>Yes you read that right, and what I thought was quite the brilliant stroke of genius to transmit that level of fear and dread into the Potter world through something quite familiar in our world, where there's a takeover of ministries and the installation of past villains who are puppets of the regime, the continued discrimination and probable extermination of the ordinary, non magical Muggles and even the half-breeds against those who are of pure magical blood, and a curious scene where a disguised Potter head inside the undergrounds of the Ministry only to see propaganda being created by the masses in creepy, clockwork like fashion.<br/><br/>Everything is doom and gloom with copious amounts of shades, shadows, black and grey (save for Hermione's red dress in one scene), where our heroic trio are quite clueless without their guardian headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) always ready to pull some strings from behind the scenes. His absence is largely felt, and they are left mostly to their own devices and smarts to try and figure out a way to get to the remaining Horcruxes and to destroy them. They become the hunted with little allies to rely on, where betrayal seem the norm, almost from within their own circle of trust as well where a major subplot continues to dwell on the suggested romantic/platonic dynamics between Hermione with Harry and Ron, the former sharing a curious dance sequence while on the run, and the latter, well having his worst fear confront his lack of courage to tell Hermione just how he feels for her, well, from how many films ago.<br/><br/>So the verdict is whether The Deathly Hallows warranted two films. My answer is a resounding, definite yes, because there's so much going on in the story, of the relationships and friendships forged over the years, of the closure both good and bad that has to come to the myriad of characters introduced (J.K. Rowling doesn't show a lot of mercy by the way), and not to mention the inherent quest that Harry, Ron and Hermione chose to embark on that has gone beyond just the survival of Harry Potter, and what's more, introduces to us what those Deathly Hallows actually are, which goes just beyond the destruction of the Horcuxes. Danger lurks at every corner and the narrative spins at breakneck speed, harrowing most times with the frequent close shaves the rookies encounter against their enemies who are growing more powerful by the minute.<br/><br/>While the previous films have boasted special effects extravaganzas be it little things to pepper the scene or large battles between wizards and witches, this is kept surprisingly muted in the film since it's swaying on one end of the spectrum with Evil gaining an upper hand, and most of the effects not already something seen before in the earlier Potter films. But what ultimately leads this film into being the more powerful one, is the strength of the story and how it leads you along the way, building anticipation as we root for positive outcomes as much as possible, with slight comedy punctuating appropriate moments to lift the spirits.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all share that perfect camaraderie that's been built over the years, it's no wonder that they add that convincing depth and natural realism to their friendship, with an audience that has largely grew up with them as well. There's no ensemble cast like the one assembled for the Potter franchise, though most of them - Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Bill Nighy, Tom Felton and a long list more - come and go too frequent and too soon, but one hopes the evil Death Eaters do get their spotlight by the time the second installment rolls over.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus may have begun the film franchise and made it a large welcome for the young (especially) and old to embrace J.K Rowling's magical world, but I am of the opinion that David Yates inherited the franchise at the right point from The Order of the Phoenix where things required a consistent hand rather than a rotating director's chair, and developed the franchise into what it is today in quite unassuming terms. Credit also has to go to Steve Kloves who has adapted from Rowling's books (save for the point where Yates came onboard), knowing what best to adapt into the film, and what to leave behind, steering clear of the more cutesy tales and plunging us headlong into Voldemort's return and ascension to power.<br/><br/>You know that this will end in a cliffhanger, and what a cliffhanger it is, whetting your appetite to devour Part 2 as soon as it's released, just so to witness how the film franchise of our generation will fittingly conclude. I can't wait, and I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of fans around the world cannot wait for the next too."
"Trangor","3","13","17","24 November 2010"," The Harry Potter Camping Movie
","Gosh, I thought, trying to stay awake through the middle of the film, who puts a half-hour camping trip in the middle of a movie? Just maybe the answer is JK Rowling in her first try at movie production. Is that a spoiler to say so? I don't know.<br/><br/>This is a pretty flawed movie. Not to say that the 1st six were great cinema, but this is obviously the worst of the lot. The situations (the wedding is only one) where the script and actors conflicted with the purported circumstances and mood were just too many. The pacing of the film is clumsy or just wrong. The story does not flow and therefore the movie does not work.<br/><br/>I was fairly dissatisfied with the film after watching but was left wondering why it was so distinctly patchy and sluggish. I checked my neck but I wasn't wearing a Horcrux.<br/><br/>The movie does pick up a bit at the end after they (Rowling & co) are done stretching it out but, again, it is disjointed.<br/><br/>Was it wrong to cheer (inwardly) when the Potter franchise equivalent of Jar Jar Binks, Dobby, got his? I don't know. But the hokey death scene and the burial (on the beach of all places) did nothing for the story.<br/><br/>In summary: too gloomy and not enough action for the kids. In addition, it's difficult to think a hard-core fan would be pleased by this movie, especially the long, boring parts. Some may be disappointed by the general production/direction of the film, as was I."
"Dandy_Desmond","5","9","11","12 April 2011"," Period Drama Slow
","I won't go into the story as there is too damn much to go through and anyone watching this film that has not watched the first 6 is wasting their time anyway. <br/><br/>So the first part of the final part is basically the first half of the book. Director David Yates I believe has done a fine job so far, however he must have taken the job of directing the final part of the story on the basis he does as he is told by splitting it in 2 and basically filming the book. <br/><br/>What I have liked about the films so far is that they have branched out and cut all the excess fat from the novels and were entertaining. I believe the first two Harry Potters are the weakest of the movies as they simply filmed the whole book. I'm afraid this has what has happened with Deathly Hallows - its a long, long slow boring movie. Almost a period drama in its solemn and serious face. <br/><br/>I saw it in the cinema and instantly disliked it - my brother has now bought the blu ray so I gave it another chance and I'm afraid its still as slow and dull as I remember. Important moments like the death of hedwig are simply passed off and the story moves on without a moments tension, drama or emotion. It just feels like it doesn't get out of first gear, the movie is in a trance - you wait for something, anything interesting to happen and it just doesn't. <br/><br/>The big mistake was splitting it in two and filming everything that was in the book. If I want all that I'll read it again I don't have to sit through 2 and a half hours of people walking about in a forest and field to get to the end. <br/><br/>As I watch the series of Harry Potters now on blu ray this will be the film I get to and think urrghh i have to sit through this to get to the very end. I find that really annoying as so far all the movies are entertaining. Even the first two which I think are quite weak are at least entertaining, Deathly Hallows is not, its very serious, very stoic and very very dull. <br/><br/>Having said that the production values and acting are all very good as usual but its just a shame they had to drain every last drop out of the cash cow and almost ruin the series.<br/><br/>Well I'm boring myself now so I'll switch off."
"kelly-thomas-1","5","16","22","22 November 2010"," An unnecessary money making strategy
","Having not read the Harry Potter books (I intend to do this after the last film), I have been watching the movies on their own merits and thus far have been delighted by what has been an exciting and innovative magical adventure. Therefore even though I figured this final instalment was in two parts so the companies involved could essentially stretch things out and make a few extra bucks, I was still excited to see it.<br/><br/>I have to say I feel cheated. The film is slow moving, full of long (and I feel unnecessary) episodes of dialogue and very little of the action and effects that are Harry Potter's trademarks. It really does feel like a film that was plonked in the middle while the makers worked on the finale.<br/><br/>Again having not read the books, I saw little point in the wedding at the beginning - I didn't have a clue who was getting married and felt no emotion. The scene with Harry and Hermione dancing was equally as pointless, and they spent waaay too much time camping in woods with nothing happening for my liking. The death of ""Mad Eye"" at the beginning was extremely underplayed for such a previously large character (it was really just ""He's dead"", ""Awwww booooo - OK so who's making the tea""), and I didn't have a clue why the cockney thief guy (Mumagan or something) was even in it. I felt very sorry for any kids watching this who have not read the books, as they didn't stand a chance.<br/><br/>I did like the overall dark atmosphere of the film, and as always the scenes involving Valdemort, Bellatrix LaStrange and the Ministry were the highlights for me.<br/><br/>Overall, this could easily (and should) have been one final fantastic film, and not, as it was, a simple money making strategy which resulted in a mediocre movie. I sincerely hope the final instalment meets the new and extremely high expectations I have now placed on it!!"

All that happens is you see the main protagonists suffer and wander around for nearly 3 hours!!!! I know fans are expecting a dignifying adaptation to the best selling book, however translating the book to script phrase by phrase was too much. <br/><br/>The film falls for other several stuff, starting with the performances, they really don't improve at all and all we get is the same wooden, stiff expressions we've seen since 2001. Then we get the script treatment, it's just a translation from the book! The story is not meant to be two separate films but a 6-hour-long feature (even Peter Jackson handled himself to give each part of LOTR trilogy its own climax). However this joke of a film doesn't care for the development of the argument or anything else. Without part 2 it's nothing but a boring sequence of scenes with no goal at all.<br/><br/>I really expected a much more fun film, however this one kicks the bucket. By some hard, well planned edition job they could have saved ourselves more than an hour of boringness (and even one film maybe).<br/><br/>All in all, this film is proof that a darker sequel or a faithfully written book adaptation not necessarily give as a result a good movie."

Trailing along are Jason Isaacs, Brendan Gleeson, Rhys Ifans and Alan Rickman with perhaps 3 minutes each, David Thewlis with 2 minutes and Timothy Spall with about the same. Helena Bonham Carter probably has 10 minutes and only over-acts for 8 of them.<br/><br/>Instead of concentrating on this galaxy of stars we spend most of the time sitting in the mountains with Harry and Hermione suffering a lot of angst or sitting in the mountains with Harry, Hermione and Ron suffering a lot of angst. As a break from the mountains we get time sitting in the forest with Harry and Hermione suffering a lot of angst, or sitting in the forest with Harry, Hermione and Ron suffering . . . well you get the picture.

"michelle-lynn13","1","24","36","26 December 2010"," If you've read the book, the movie disappoints..
","Sadly, Kloves and Yates took Rowling's richly detailed character driven story and turned into an action film. I found myself surprised at the realization a couple weeks ago that I had just finished reading the last installment of the Harry Potter books for a third time. Admittedly, I have not yet read the first four books; coincidentally, the first four movies, I liked. The last three books, I've read and perhaps not so coincidentally, I was disappointed by the films for all three (so far - in as much as the last book has been split into two parts). Rowling's writings of the books are very rich in detail, detail which illustrates quite beautifully the nuances of the relationships that the characters have with one another and thus offer the understanding for the how and why of the characters' development. Key details in Rowling's novels set up plot points and history for the subsequent novels. In The Half Blood Prince, the movie, Ginny leads Harry into the Room of Requirement to hide the potions book. In the novel, Harry decides to hide the book to avoid having it confiscated after using a curse hand-written in the book against Draco Malfoy. The importance of this change is in the final book, when Harry is looking for the Horcruxes he recalls having seen the Diadem of Ravenclaw on the bust perched on the cabinet in which he hid the book. Now that the movie has altered this happening, they've removed the setup for Harry finding one of the final Horcruxes in the Room of Requirement. Details such as these go towards showing the definition of the characters themselves...how Harry is different from Voldemort is his remarkable capacity to love in spite of all that he has suffered. He cares for his friends, whereas Voldemort has no friends. The ""lessons"" that Dumbledore has with Harry in the sixth book are important for Harry to learn all that he can to understand Tom Riddle and how he became Voldermort so that he will know how to defeat him. In the movie, these ""lessons"" are completely glossed over and there is no great understanding offered into Riddle's background and history. Like the comment Dumbledore makes about Tom keeping souvenirs, this is a clue for Harry when trying to figure out what objects Voldemort selected as his Horcruxes. In the book, The Order of the Phoenix, the members of Dumbledore's Army communicate via the enchanted Galleons, no mention of this at all in the movie and yet this is key for how the students communicate whilst at school in the last book while waging war. I do understand that the films would be way too long if they all followed the books to the letter, however, let me offer Sir Peter Jackson and his translation of Tolkien's critically acclaimed classic literature into three fantastic epic films that do absolute justice the books with exceptional scripts and filmmaking. Yates and Kloves would have done well to pause for a moment and asked if they were making action movies or were they trying to tell the story of Harry Potter. To me, filmmaking is storytelling in its own right. Granted, a book depends upon the imagination of the readers' to create a picture with the words on the page, while film removes the necessity of imagination because the picture is painted for the viewer via the interpretation of the filmmaker. Yet, in my opinion, Yates took too much liberty with the stories and changed them without regard to how it limited the understanding of the characters, their development, and the choices that they made. I could go on and on because there are so many more instances where the details cut from the books for the movies diminish the robustness of the characters that Rowling created, but to what end really? There was no mention of the relationship of the House Elf Kreacher with Harry and how much it had changed after Harry showed Kreacher the smallest of kindnesses by giving him the fake locket. How Kreacher then starting cooking wholesome comforting meals for the three friends while they were doing reconnaissance at the Ministry of Magic. Had the filmmakers chosen to show the time that Harry, Ron and Hermione had spent going back and forth under the cloak one at a time; shown how they had to move every time they said Voldemort's name because it had been ""tabooed""; then Ron's defection and subsequent return would have been more logical, understandable, and forgivable. Had they shown in the last film that the students were fighting already when Harry and Dumbledore returned, introduced Fleur and Bill which sets up the wedding in the next film; shown the gravity of Bill's injuries, shown the strain for Tonks and Lupin. These moments were all in the books, and they are all integral parts of the story that the movies do not tell. The movies just barely skim the surface on these and many other points almost in arrogance with the assumption that a split second on screen is sufficient for the suspension of disbelief....in the case of a movie in the genre of fantasy, the suspension of disbelief is not so much the goal as is character development in the hopes that the audience is invested in the characters and wants to join them on the journey. This quality is missing from this film as well as the others that Yates and Kloves have done in the series. I want to say to them - it's not just all about the cool special effects gentlemen, the Harry Potter series is in fact an exploration of character, the depth of humanity in the face of death and the sacrifices one is willing to make for their friends and loved ones time and again despite tragedy; it's about the triumph of the human spirit and the capacity to love. See the film if you must, but just know, it's the missed the mark."

","zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.......<br/><br/>Seriously, this was so dull.<br/><br/>Harry and co teleport to new place. They get found. They wave wands at each other. Harry and co teleport to new place. They get found. They wave wands at each other...<br/><br/>... for nearly 3 hours! Pretty much nothing happens and anything that does happen either makes no sense or doesn't bloody get shown.<br/><br/>For example, Harry's BFF randomly gets upset, storms out, randomly comes back a few minutes later. Why? What was the point? <br/><br/>The Minister of Magic comes to see Harry. Next scene we learn he's dead and the Ministry has fallen to the bad guys... what happened? And why the did they leave us watching a stupid wedding while an epic war of good vs evil was taking place down the road? <br/><br/>How do they just randomly keep being in the right place? We need to find these ""Horcruxes""... oh look, there's one in the first house we go to. We need the Master Sword to destroy it... oh look, it's in this lake right next to us... Harry is drowning... oh look, BFF is back... ARGH!!!!!<br/><br/>How can you possibly build any kind of suspense when everything is just ridiculously easy? I mean, sure, in a lot of films you kinda know certain people are not going to die at certain times, but this goes far beyond this. Not only do you know they're not going to die, you know EXACTLY how they'll get away. *Spolier*: They wave wands at each other, then teleport.<br/><br/>In summary then, if you like wand waving and the occasional teleporting you do not wanna miss this."

","The last book in the Harry Potter saga has been split into two parts. At first, maybe people would think it is to squeeze some more financial mileage out of the series. On the other hand, having watched this installment, there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.<br/><br/>This Part 1 is already a very full two and half hours. The drama begins even before the opening credits roll. The special effects have reached a new high point with the trick of using polyjuice potion to create multiple Harry's. The frenetic escape of Harry in Hagrid's motor sidecar is an achievement in action editing. The trio's penetration of the Ministry of Magic to get the locket horcrux is very exciting and tension-filled.<br/><br/>Momentum dips a bit in the midsection as our trio scour the English wilderness for a way to destroy the horcrux. This prolonged section, which some may find boring, dealt more with the personal relationships loyalty of the three friends as challenges are thrown their way. The segment is marked by the hard-to-watch bloodlust of Bellatrix Lestrange and the nobility of Dobby. Watch out too for a most unexpected dance scene which will surely make you smile, if not actually chuckle!<br/><br/>In the third section, we learn what the ""deathly hallows"" are referred to in the title as our trio learns it from Xenophilius Lovegood. But the main highlight here is a most amazing animated short featurette called ""The Tale of Three Brothers"" as narrated by Hermione. This Part 1 ends very well with a sky-splitting final cliffhanger sequence.<br/><br/>Its been repeatedly mentioned how the main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all grown up in front of our eyes as this movie series unfolded. Rupert and Emma are both taller than Daniel already! Acting-wise, everyone had likewise improved very much. They all even show some skin here. Yes, even Hermione! The support from the esteemed gallery of British actors and actresses serve the film very well indeed. We saw everyone from all the previous films it seems, except for Maggie Smith.<br/><br/>The direction of David Yates is excellent as he did in the last two films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves got just the proper mix of action, drama and humor needed to make the saga work on screen. This may just be a set-up installment, however, it stands very strong on its own merits. As the last scene faded to black, the audience will definitely develop the resolve to watch out for the concluding part to be released next summer, and witness the epic Battle of Hogwarts."

","Since we first heard of WBs decision to break the last book of the HP series into two books, we've all been asking ""is this required to give full treatment to the Harry Potter universe wrap-up, or is it just a ploy to make the studios more money?"" After seeing HP/DH Pt I, I have to say ""it's the latter"".<br/><br/>I say this because it's a very weak movie.<br/><br/>It is slow. It is ponderous. It is blandly written, blandly acted, muddily filmed, badly directed. It has no heart, no soul, it's just a collected series of vignettes and action sequences strung together by lots of wandering around. This is a phoned-in movie, you can see that the filmmakers have simply stopped caring but do it anyway because they know people will buy it. Or perhaps it's like a parent who has read the same book to their 4-year-old 87 times and has had just about enough of it, but still reads it again.<br/><br/>Purists will probably like this film because it does contain more ""canon"" than prior films. But this film ALSO explains why you can't film a book beat-for-beat, it ends up bland and lifeless. The screenwriter did not do a good film-to-book translation this time, it seems like he just shoved the manuscript into screenplay software and called it a day. All the various episodes and incidents are simply chained together without much to tie them in. There's very little emotional reason to move this story along from point to point, things just sort of move. This is a lot like JKRs writing itself, she always found some little hunk of trivia to shove the plot along rather than developing a story that grows organically. It should have been the screenwriters job to find the emotional cores of the story, focus on those, and craft a screenplay accordingly. But he didn't. This is like recipe cooking instead of culinary artistry.<br/><br/>The primary actors (the three heroes) didn't help matters much. Either through choices of their own or through poor direction, they woodenly carry on, showing very little emotional range, even during the various argument scenes. And AGAIN they're playing broody, angsty teenagers. OK, OK, we've seen that in the last three movies. Can we move along now, please???? These actors are not pushing themselves and are not being pushed. Again, they're phoning it in, just like everyone else phoned it in. I hope they at least made barrels of cash for the effort.<br/><br/>And where are the rest of this stellar cast? There is some enjoyable stuff from Brendan Gleeson and Imelda Staunton, and Helena Bonham Carter has a far-too-short, intensely creepy scene with Emma Watson, but the rest are absent or nearly so. Alan Rickman only has a cameo, and basically everyone else acts as nothing but window dressing. Even Bonnie Wright, playing Harry's love interest, is given nothing more than a single scene, where in the book she's constantly in his head. Part of the appeal of the HP movies is the richness given by the myriad of characters, but here they're just set pieces. I'm not even a fan of Ralph Fiennes work in this film, he was better in earlier ones. They should have cut back-and-forth between actions elsewhere in the world rather than making us watch the Three Amigos lost in the woods for hours on end.<br/><br/>Then there's the cinematography. Somewhere down the line, someone said ""this is a dark film"". And that's how it's filmed: dark. Has a perpetual eclipse hit the Hogwarts world? Ugh, it's downright putrid to watch. Guys, ""dark"" is a DESCRIPTION OF THE FEELING OF THE MOVIE, not a literal description of the visuals. You can have moods and tension and ""darkness"" in broad, sunny daylight. filmmakers have done this all the time for decades. Watch the ending of ""Se7en"", filmed on a bright, sunny day in California scrubland, yet is one of the creepiest, nastiest scenes ever captured on film. Dark doesn't mean drab.<br/><br/>What I see in HP/DH Pt. 1 is a full retreat into complacency, pattern, style, and motif that these producers have used for the past two films. They have taken no risks, are making no statements, are doing nothing more than mass-producing HP movies for our consumption. They are phoning it in. The HP franchise has officially become stale and lifeless.<br/><br/>Sadly, they'll make millions making it."

","This movie, next to the order of the phoenix was, in my opinion, one of the worst potter movies ever as far as book loyalty. So many characters were left out, scenes were torn apart and replaced with ones that were only decipherable by a few key phrases, but I think the all around worst scenes of this movie would have to be in the scenes at Xeno Lovegood's house, the snatchers (greyback is completely cut out of the story line) the wedding (very quickly done with no time taken to really give it the beauty it deserved) and above all else, Malfoy manor when Dobby helps them escape. (Bellatrix bites into Hermione's arm the word mud blood and doesn't torture her, and she keeps her wand, and wormtail doesn't kill himself. Also fairly disappointing was any and all scenes in the black house. It was a very good movie, but not for those who were lovers of the book. I give it 5 stars simply owing to the fact that the actors were phenomenal, the effects were amazing, and it kept you on the edge of your seat."

But let's have Daniel Radcliff take off his shirt so they won't know they've been suckered."" Even if you're read the book and watched the other movies, the plot is incomprehensible. The movie consists of a bunch of action sequences strung together with no regard for the story.<br/><br/>At least I didn't pay to watch it in 3D."

Very little cheerfulness. I almost bought the DVD but after renting and watching, no need to watch again like the other series. I would never want my children to watch this movie due to multiple disturbing scenes. There is good action and special effects like the other movies, but I was left with a sense of dread after watching. The magic was gone from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part one.

","Almost a decade has passed since Harry first encountered Hogwarts. The long anticipated battle between Harry and Voldemort is drawing near. Hogwarts has become no more safe haven. The Ministry has set Harry as a fugitive. The beginning of the end has begun. <br/><br/>First, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is the seventh film in the Harry Potter series based on the first half of the book. It is as usual dark in a David-Yates- Style. In its whole 146-minute run, ""Deathly Hallows"" follows Harry, Hermione and Ron who are on the run from the MInistry of Magic now controlled by the bald-looking, dangerous, evil Voldemort as well as trying to locate and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes as explained in ""Half-Blood Prince"". <br/><br/>""Deathly Hallows"" will introduce several new characters and they include Xenophilius Lovegood and Rufus Scrmigeour. Xenophilius Lovegood is undoubtedly Luna Lovegood's father. While Rufus Scrmigeour is the Minister until the Death Eaters swarm in the Minister. ""Deathly Hallows"" also sees the return of our beloved characters such as Dobby and Kreacher, the house elves. <br/><br/>""Deathly Hallows"" will not only introduce new characters but also new locations and they include the Malfoy Manor, where the Malfoys live. We will also see Harry, Ron and Hermione in the mortal world rather than the magical world for around half of the book such as Tottenham Court Road.<br/><br/>A note for Harry Potter fans, you will not see Harry, Hermione and Ron in Hogwarts anymore. There will be no Quidditch games, Fred and George's shop, love potion problems or even their friends although Neville and Luna appear in small roles. So, ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is really dark than the previous films and there will be no happy moments. But, the movie will still have some jokes, funny ones to cheer up scenes which are too heart-breaking.<br/><br/>The movie will also see some emotional scenes that will show growth in the characters especially Ron. The relationship between Hermione and Ron would be a little bit threatened due to the quest and of course, a bit of Harry. <br/><br/>The performances by the actors and actresses actually match the Oscar standards I would say. Emma Watson shows growth in her acting and seemed confident than ever. Rupert Grint showed some growth in his acting too by the emotional scenes given. Daniel Radcliffe seemed even more confident but was a bit less in depth compared to the other two. Overall, the movie consists of remarkable acting performances. But, I would say the one who performed best was as always from the fifth film, Helena Bonham Carter or known as the wicked Bellatrix Lestrange. The acting was totally perfect not to mention the remarkable acting contribution from Imelda Staunton or better known as Dolores Umbridge.<br/><br/>Exciting and thrilling, I really enjoyed the film. It was dark, brilliant and perfect. Although a bit slow-paced, I still really enjoyed the film. I don't think it will disappoint any one even its book's fans. Even though the scenes were re-arranged while some excluded, it was still acceptable and as a reader of the book, I really appreciated the changes. So, book fans of the series, you wouldn't be too disappointed with the movie as the movie was loyal enough to the book. Also, the film ends with a horrifying scene related to Voldemort and it makes you have the creeps. But, that all ends in Part 2, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Thank you David Yates for creating a very dark and amazing film. Can't wait for Part 2! <br/><br/>Prince AJB's Score: 10/10<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review on ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". Hope it's useful to you."

","First thing you'll notice when you start to watch this film is the way how dark it looks, its actually so dark that you probably try to crank it lighter with your TV remote.<br/><br/>It is plain awful and you'll miss all of the detail in the whole film because of this. Its so dark, that you don't know what is happening. This really a problem or mistake that the studio made, because it will annoy people for 70% of the film.<br/><br/>And talking about the detail, there is almost none. Harry Potter supposed to be a fantasy film, and this film is lacking it greatly, all of the nice details that we love from the books are missing, or rushed.<br/><br/>The film has some really nice action scene's only they are really too short, it lacks the time to enjoy the action scenes. Which is the main problem of this film.<br/><br/>The reason that the first four films are probably people's favorite is because it doesn't lack effects and fantasy, and it takes its time to reveal those.<br/><br/>David Yates portraits the magic on a dull way, and it is a shame that it is the last harry potter film.<br/><br/>Story. Although its hard to tell this book in two chapters. Many characters aren't being showed off in this film, there is a minor scene with Alan Rickman, and the Weasly Family. But the whole film is being carried away by the three main characters. they probably wanted to show the emotion and growth in the young actors but, it is getting a little bit boring half way of the film.<br/><br/>""small spoiler""<br/><br/>Instead of having a emotional scene with Harry Potter grieving about the loss of some of his friends. They choose to have scenes about the struggle between friendship along the journey. <br/><br/>The only fresh scene at the end of the film is with Rhys Ifans who's playing Xenophilius Lovegood,<br/><br/>Hopefully the second part will make it better, but i doubt its going to show some difference.<br/><br/>Lets hope Harry Potter will cast something amazing from his wand in part two."

After watching it, it's clear the only reason they separated the last movie into two parts is because they're greedy and want as much money as possible because let me tell you, there was no need to have half of the scenes contained in the movie. It actually could have been cut in half without leaving any important scenes out. When you're not watching Harry and Hermione sit around doing nothing, then you're watching Ron, Harry and Hermione sit around doing nothing. The scenes were soooooo drawn out, hardly any action, barely any special effects...just awful. I can't believe how many people said it was great on here because the theater I was in was packed and not a single person in there looked happy after the movie. I found myself paying more attention to the popcorn crunching noises, kids talking, and other commotion in the audience than I was to the actual movie. Plus I actually dozed off twice!! And I read and enjoyed the books! I suspect the majority of reviews came from girls who rated it high because Ron and Harry are topless in several scenes.

","How glad am I that the decision was made to split the last book into two movies! Combining such massive content in one movie would inevitably have ended up looking rushed and in turn would not have done any justice to the much awaited final installment of the series.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Harry Potter ceased to be a book/movie just for children a long time ago. This is much more apparent with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The story has evolved along with the characters and it has gotten darker and more thrilling every step of the way. The lead actors have come such a long way since their adventures during the first year at Hogwarts. This movie sees a grown up and mature Harry who is the only hope to save the wizarding and muggle world from Lord Voldemort and his followers. Together with his best friends Ron and Hermione, he sets out on a dangerous quest to destroy the elusive Horcruxes, magical objects that protect a part of Voldemort's soul. In the process, he comes across the legend of the Deathly Hallows and realizes their significance in destroying Voldemort. The next movie will see Harry torn between a desire to acquire the Deathly Hallows and continue on with his mission of destroying the Horcruxes.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has improved in leaps and bounds since he first appeared on screen. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley gets an opportunity to show different sides of his personality and not just appear perpetually disgusted or perplexed. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is always a delight. She has tremendous screen presence. I do wish though that there was a bit more chemistry between her character and that of Ron. The scenes that were truly touching in the movie were Hermione leaving her parents home, the brief moment where she dances with Harry in the tent and the death of the house-elf Dobby. <br/><br/>As a whole, I thought the movie stayed faithful to the book as much as possible without any major changes. The supporting cast was good, the pace was reasonable and the cinematography was excellent."
"Leofwine_draca","1","13","19","22 April 2011"," The worst yet
","Without a doubt the worst Harry Potter film yet, and this is somebody who didn't like the last three entries in the series, either. The decision to split the seventh book into two parts mean that this one is long winded and preoccupied with needless trivia. The first, better half is similar to ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and HALF BLOOD PRINCE in that it tries to cram too much into too short a space of time. It's all about the detail, and any attempts at atmosphere or suspense are bypassed in favour of storytelling (and don't get me started on the lameness of the horcrux plotting). The second half of the film involves one long camping trip in the woods, spicing things up with a little sexuality and violence. It's as dull and pointless as it sounds.<br/><br/>The worst mistake is wasting one of the biggest ensemble casts in British film history. Why cast the likes of Alan Rickman, Brendan Gleeson, Robbie Coltrane, Rhys Ifans, Jason Isaacs, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter et al when none of them get more than a couple of minutes screen time apiece. Daniel Radcliffe appears bored, itching to take on more adult roles, while Rupert Grint barely registers. Hermione turned from an engagingly cute bookworm into whiny, frowning, petulant little character a long time ago and I ended up praying that the scriptwriters would change the story and kill her off. No such luck.<br/><br/>Add in some poor editing, seen-it-all-before type special effects and poor action sequences and you have an aimless, disappointing movie with a tired feel. Take, for instance, the wand battle: it's filmed like a gunfight. Gunfights have been filmed in thousands of movies, wand fights in only a few, so why go down the dull and clich√É¬©d route instead of thinking of something more spectacular? Just one example of the deficit of imagination found everywhere in this film."
"stuffedpenguins","Null","13","19","4 December 2010"," It could have been so much more!
","I usually dislike movies based upon books, but the first six Harry Potter movies were a very pleasant change and stuck as closely to the books as could be squeezed into a few hours of screen time. Unfortunately, HP7 is the exception to that. When I read the book, I mentioned to my husband I had no idea how they would cover everything in one movie and was pleased to hear they split it in two, but this movie was a huge disappointment. Everything that made the book a real conclusion to the story was skipped in favor of shaky-cam dramatics that jumped from scene to scene, leaving the important and symbolic portions on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job and have proved themselves as professionals, and the special effects are brilliant. From the heroes to the villains, every one of them played their parts to perfection. I can't say enough good things about the casting and acting throughout the series, and that continues in HP7. The special effects made me see the fantastic world in visual form. Each of those things have been top-notch in the former stories and continued in this one.<br/><br/>What's the problem, then? Everything important in the book was abandoned. The book started with a scene between Harry and the Dursleys much like all the previous ones. It really highlighted the end of innocence for the two cousins in a farewell with Dudley that was shamefully left out of the film. I think that one scene could have framed the transition in far less screen time than the released nonsense, and the movie went downhill from there. Fans of brainless action flicks will probably adore this film since that's the style adopted, but the symbolism and dark wonder characterized in the real story was entirely absent in the film.<br/><br/>The filming style was nauseating in many places, and in one particular scene towards the end, a girl in the row behind us muttered that she couldn't watch the shaky camera shots any longer or she would be sick. My husband commented it was like someone took a snippet from Blair Witch Project and flung it in the middle of this movie. Truly disappointing.<br/><br/>I don't know why so much creative license was taken in this version when the previous movies stuck pretty closely to the books. This could have been so much better, particularly since there are two films to cover what was admittedly a lot of important information in the books. Unfortunately, the editing and cinematography fell flat on its face."
"kylopod","8","13","19","22 November 2010"," Well, the fans asked for it, and they got it
","Ever since the release of the first Harry Potter movie in 2001, I've wondered how a TV miniseries of the books would have fared. The movies so far have had difficulties showing enough of the books' events within a reasonable time slot to keep the story flowing. They've all had to omit significant plot points, which has not only disappointed the more literal-minded fans but risked the integrity of the story. This was most painfully evident in the fifth movie, ""Order of the Phoenix,"" which awkwardly attempted to fit the longest Potter book into just 2 hours and 15 minutes of film. The result was a movie that felt choppy and barely coherent, almost dreamlike. The two best films up to now--the third and the sixth--worked in part because they took the most risks, often departing substantially from the narrative of the books, to the consternation of many fans. I was not one of the fans complaining, because I figured that as long as it wasn't a miniseries, the best approach was to interpret the story rather than present the events exactly as they appeared in the books.<br/><br/>Dividing the seventh book into two movies has given a taste of what a miniseries might have been like. ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is a more faithful adaptation than any of the previous films. This surprised me a little, because the portion of Book Seven it covers is actually longer than the entirety of some of the earlier books. (As I was rereading it a few months ago, I correctly guessed where they'd end Part 1--it's at an important turning point in the story that occurs close to the two-thirds mark.) Most of the film's sequences are exactly as I had envisioned them, and sometimes better than I had envisioned them. I especially liked its approach to the Riddle-Hermione scene, to the matter of protective enchantments around their camp (which is handled with a nice dose of spookiness), and to a spell that distorts a character's face. Apart from the oversimplification of a few plot details here and there, any flaws in the story come straight from the book. The two-and-half-hour movie drags at some points, but then so did the book, particularly in the forest scenes. The plot concerns Voldemort's takeover of the wizarding world and pursuit of Harry, who goes into hiding with Ron and Hermione but repeatedly endangers them and himself in his daunting efforts to find and destroy a set of objects that keep Voldemort immortal, aided only by a few enigmatic clues Dumbledore has left him.<br/><br/>It is not a very accessible film for non-fans. People who haven't read or seen any of the previous installments will probably be lost. It never once pauses to explain the Harry Potter universe or anything about the background to these tumultuous events, not even a prologue like the one that began the third of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films. The good news is that it doesn't condescend to the audience. The bad news is that if you don't know or can't remember things like what a horcrux is or what happens when you point a wand at someone and say ""Obliviate,"" you might have trouble following the story.<br/><br/>As a fan, however, I loved it. It's just well-filmed, and I had notably fewer complaints about acting and special effects than I had for the previous movies. The CGI is relatively unobtrusive, and there aren't too many fake-looking moments. (The house-elves look especially good this time.) Ralph Fiennes finally appears to have settled into the role of Voldemort, after having delivered somewhat phoned-in performances previously. The kids, who get to dominate more scenes than in any of the other films, when their presence was counterbalanced by a plethora of seasoned British performers who are mostly absent here, have really grown into their roles. They were well-cast from the start and always had a certain raw talent, but early in the series they possessed some of the amateur qualities common to young actors. They have become increasingly proficient as the series has progressed (which I suspect was what the studio intended when it eschewed the tradition of casting older actors in child roles). Here they display the kind of camaraderie that can only be developed gradually, after having acted together in several films, and it makes the scenes that deal with their relationship feel natural and unforced.<br/><br/>I actually look forward to seeing the movie again at some point, just so I can sit back and take in more of the details. I think I didn't appreciate it enough the first time, distracted as I was by my knowledge of what happens in the book and the lack of any significant divergence in the film's depiction. There is not a lot in this film that will surprise fans; the enjoyment comes from seeing how vividly it is all brought to life."
"Marter2","5","14","21","4 December 2010"," No emotion, disappointing film
","I've heard a lot of people say that reviewing the newest Harry Potter movie is a pointless exercise. By now, people have made up their minds regarding the film series. If they are on-board, then they'll see it regardless, and if they don't like it, they aren't going to make an exception for the newest one. That's fair enough, but it's not a sentiment I necessarily agree with.<br/><br/>I don't think that has to be correct, because Deathly Hallows Part 1 has convinced me it is not. I think it actually could turn people off the series. That's not to say that it is a terrible film, but all of the charm that the previous films had seem to have been lost with this one. There is also the worrying thought that since Part 1 and Part 2 were shot back-to-back, the second film will have the same flaws.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the first of two films based on JK. Rowling's seventh Harry Potter book. It, once again, stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. That's about all the actors who ""star"" in the film, as none of the secondary actors are given much chance to enhance or establish their characters.<br/><br/>This ends up being the first problem with the film. None of the secondary cast members get their fair share of screen time. Take, for example, Alan Rickman as Severous Snape. He's a character that was incredibly interesting in the first few films, and pivotal in the last one. Here, he gets maybe two scenes over the course of the film, none of which are that important. This is true for all of the other secondary characters as well. They show up, disappear for a while, and then reappear for another scene. That's all we get from them, and it doesn't allow any time to get any insight into their character that we hadn't already been shown.<br/><br/>While you are expected to have watched the previous six films in order to get a feel for the characters, it almost feels like you could have skipped them and still have gotten a good idea of what is happening. Not being in that situation myself, I cannot be sure, but the film did seem to be a bit too direct in an attempt to fill the audience in on what happened previously. Certain plot points continue to be hammered home, multiple times, and it makes you feel like the film doesn't think you are smart enough to remember them.<br/><br/>Without involving the secondary characters, the film turns out to consist mostly of Harry, Ron and Hermione, one of which ends up being absent for a large chunk of time, searching around various locations for the remaining Horcruxes. Since Hogwarts has now been taken over, they can't go back there, so they instead decide to ditch their final year of classes and go on an adventure. The Hogwarts setting is actually what made a lot of the previous movies interesting for me, meaning this change was not a good one in my mind. Yes, I am well aware that this also happens in the book, and can't be omitted, but making it happen for almost all of the entire two and a half hours the film plays for is not welcome.<br/><br/>This also means that the film does get kind of boring. The secondary characters made the previous films more interesting, but since most of them are absent from this one, we can only focus on our three leads. These are characters who, after this film, I have grown to dislike. I didn't before, because there would always be side-sessions with other characters dispersed between long sequences with the primary cast. Here, we don't get that, and I began to grow tired of Harry, Ron and Hermione.<br/><br/>The worst part about it is the fact that the film does attempt to have some emotional moments. Sadly, they almost all fall flat on their face. There is one scene, right near the end that was sad, but the rest of the time, I was sitting there questioning why they even bothered to try to stir emotions. There were also attempts at humour throughout, none of which worked in lightening the mood, and only served to remind me that when the film tries to change the mood, it fails.<br/><br/>The best part about the film was the visual effects. From transforming characters into multiple Harry Potters, to the house elves, to the spells used, you can tell that a lot of effort was put into the visuals. The film looks nice all around, and it does take you to various locations. At least you'll have some nice scenery to look at.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure whether or not I can dissuade Harry Potter fans from going to see Deathly Hallows Part 1, but I hope that they will take this review as a caution. This is perhaps the weakest film of the series, and it fails to bring any depth to any character that isn't named Harry, Ron, or Hermione. The scenery and visuals are great, but the secondary characters are pushed aside for ones that end up getting on your nerves. I do fear, however, for Part 2, as they were shot back-to-back. Hopefully they will rectify them in the editing process, or even go back and re-shoot some scenes before release. Either way, I was let down by Part 1."

","First of all I'm a fan of HP, have been since I was the same age the actors were when they started this movie venture because of J.K's awesome ability to write her world and bring it to life through them. However, I have never been a big fan of the movies because, obviously, they can never capture the true essence of the books. Key word: Essence; not every boring camping trip that happens. Although it's true the the bigger the books got the more the movies were rushed to get to key points and events. Although I'm trying to discern why that was not the case with this movie. I was truly and more irrevocable disappointed with this film as NOTHING HAPPENED! You spent most watching them camp and wander about and when you did reach the part where they destroyed the Horcrux it was so uneventful and disturbing. I'm sorry to say, but the image Ron saw was not needed to the full explicitly that was displayed. It makes me wonder how the actors felt seeing that; I mean yes, it is technically their characters and it was manipulated using CGI but still, was that really necessary? The 30mins where something ACTUALLY happened could have been incorporated into an actual film. This splitting the movie into two parts just to make more money from this franchise is despicable, especially in these economic times. We want something worth our money, not something else to waste it on and make us think we should have just splurged on those new shirts or something. I'd rather wait for it's TV debut on the movie network then either waste mine or my parents money on a 4-5hr movie where nothing happens for half of it instead of purchasing it like the other six. For shame, Warner Brothers and David Yates, for shame."

","I'm not a Harry Potter fan and I've never read the books, but I have seen all the movies up to now and have been following the unfolding plot. Bear in mind, this is a review of the movie, not the book.<br/><br/>I saw two movies this week, the low budget ""Monsters"" and the big budget Harry Potter sequel, and I'm not sure which one bored me the most. I think I spent more time looking at my watch with Harry Potter. The middle part where they jumped all over the place & spent nights in their tent could have been greatly shortened. The information I needed to carry me into the finale could have been covered in 15 minutes. This did not need to be a two part movie. This was clearly just dragging it out into two episodes for profit purposes.<br/><br/>This was also a very dark & violent movie. Lots of blood, lots of killing. I don't have children, but if I did, I wouldn't let them see this movie.<br/><br/>Seeing the current rating of 8.3 at this writing, obviously there are two versions of this movie out and my theater was playing the bad version."
"mccormick632","5","20","32","3 December 2010"," Absolutely Awful!
","Congratulations Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet, you've just been out-sucked! The new reigning champion of awful movies is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1! No longer shall you have the honor of being deemed (by unanimous vote of one) the worst movie of all time, now you are a close second to this utter abomination of a film! Congratulations to David Yates and the entire cast & crew of this piece of s***, you made the worst film of all time! I would give you a trophy, but I think robbing me of 2 1/2 hours of my life is enough punishment for one lifetime.<br/><br/>Harry Potter 7 Part 1, is so bad, so god-awful, that I can't even come up with a way to describe its awfulness without: A) insulting its fans, B) hating on the series as a whole, and C) talk about my desire to burn every DVD/Blu-Ray copy of this movie I will get my hands on. I hate this film that much! From beginning to end, Harry Potter 7 Part 1 is one poor excuse for an action scene after another, and all of the supposedly dramatic scenes, such as the death of Hedwig and Dobby, are so stupid and so poorly handled that I found myself laughing rather than feeling sad. The story is at such a slow pace, I found myself falling asleep, and at one point, I found myself looking over to my friends with whom I watched this mess, and they were both on their Iphones, no doubt implicating at how boring this movie is.<br/><br/>While on the topic of boredom, is it really asking too much to want a good action scene? I could barely get pasted all of the fast editing, and (in one instance) the shaky camera that gives the illusion of a fast, intense action scene, when in reality its a sign of laziness. I could barely get pasted the painfully slow camping scenes, the pointless dance scene (though it did provide one unintentionally hilarious moment where Harry is trying to dance with Hermione and she looks at him with no interest or sign of emotion whatsoever. She seriously looks at him as if trying to say, ""Harry, f*** off!""), and the horrible climax that doesn't make any sense or show any traces of excitement. I also noted some blatant rip-offs from another popular fantasy-epic series of films, the Lord of the Rings. Stop me if this sounds familiar: a small piece of metal that when worn, turns the wearer into a jerk. If you aren't thinking about the One Ring from the Lord of the Rings, then you may have not been able to remember those movies, or just didn't care.<br/><br/>Oh, and to give a pretty good idea at how the movie is, I recommend watching the Bum Review from ThatGuyWithTheGlasses.com because it is hilarious, and brings up several good points. I have a different opinion from the critic, but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious. Warning: it does contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to this poor excuse for a film. I have one question, Why kill Hedwig the owl? He didn't do anything, and when he dies, why didn't the death eater who killed him kill Harry? He just looks at him, he could have finished him right there, Harry was busy driving the motorcycle, he was open, why didn't you f*****g finish him?! It's moments like that that really infuriate me because it reminds me at how hopelessly stupid these characters are and their petty ""accomplishments"" that end up accomplishing nothing. For example: when Snape(who wasn't in the movie enough, seriously, only a 5 minute scene?!) says that the Ministry of Magic has been successfully taken over, I literally thought to myself: ""What? That organization that did absolutely nothing and was run by idiots? Yeah, it WOULD be easy to take over!""<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but in summary, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is such an abomination, such a colossal failure of a film, that I get infuriated just thinking about it. It fails on nearly every level and the only glimpses of happiness that I get from this movie is the fact that there is only one left, one, single, probably bad, movie left. When it comes out, I will be ecstatic, since this will be the last of a awful franchise."
"joshbwhite","1","118","229","23 November 2010"," Harry Potter and the Random Series of Forests
","Completely lacking in imagination, storytelling, and cinematography, this is the worst I have seen in the series. <br/><br/>Aside from the first 15 and last 15 minutes, The Hallows is the most boring and badly presented to date. I understand character development and a sub story was going on during this portion, but it is so blatantly spoon fed and boring it was borderline offensive. Characters should be developed by following them through a story, not by stopping (or slowing) the story to develop the character! <br/><br/>As for audience appeal I can say only this: being a PG-13 movie with such dark and sexual overtones the dialog and presentation feels aimed at the intellect of a 6 year old audience.<br/><br/>Further, the way that characters just hop in and out of scenes, unannounced, and unexplained ruined most every major action sequence for me.<br/><br/>The three main characters can't ever figure anything out on their own or spot obvious traps. They just dumbly wander from dangerous situation to the next while trying not to unravel simple clues. They are constantly bailed out by random characters showing up at just the right random time and place. I didn't read this book, but I have read a few, and the author seems to describe the situations and traps as subtle and tricky. The director failed at this concept completely.<br/><br/>They should not have split this into two movies, and I honestly hope, when I watch part 2 at home, the director pulls his production team, editing, and writing together for something that makes sense and serves to fill more then just time."

","I'm glad I am not the only one that thought this was the most boring - and worst of the Harry Potter franchise. That is dragged out over two hours made it worse. The three main characters had lost their spark and almost looked bored and tired themselves. There were some very dark undertones about death and had this been around when my kids were young, I would have hesitated to let them see this. Mind you I think they would have given up after the first half hour.<br/><br/>I guess there must have been budget constraints as there only fleeting appearances of the usual characters other than Harry and his friends and very little 'magic' and absolutely no fun.<br/><br/>The only redeeming element for me was seeing some scenery that I had been to in real life.<br/><br/>Very disappointing."
"Eelco_1977","4","24","40","24 December 2010"," Do people really like this film?! It was so utterly boring!
","After I'd seen the sixt Potter movie, I thought they would improve on the pace in this (part 1) seventh movie. But boy, was I wrong. I was so bored after the very well done beginning of the movie. Voldemort's meeting and the motorcycle chase were very exciting, but then it started again just like in part six...the very very slow scenes about how Harry thinks he's so alone and he and his friends don't know what to do...blablabla. Really, I have to see the second part of the seventh book, just because I have to know how it all ends, but the director is giving me a really hard time. I like the wonderous world of Harry Potter, but not like this. Personally, I think the fourth part was by far the most exciting of the Potter movies. OK, now let's sum up what I liked about this seventh movie: -The beginning (Voldemort's meeting and motorcycle chase) -The overall look of the movie (sets, lighting, etc.) -The Deadly Hallows story sequence -The casting. Helena Bonham Carter is one of my favorite actresses Now, things that I didn't like: -The pace...ow my goodness. And I thought Gone with the Wind was slow or for instance Dr. Zhivago or Signs. -Ron thinking Harry has the hots for Hermione and fighting about it. Jeez...this was so forced. I mean, Harry already knew in the 5th and certainly in the 6th movie that Ron liked Hermione and Harry already had it going with Ginny. This was so stupid and boring. -How many items do they actually need to kill Voldemort. 7 Horcruxes that can be destroyed by a sword and than you also have the 3 Deadly Hallows. My goodness...in a computer game OK...but in a movie?! -When it became clear the neckless was making people angry I wanted to shout: ""Cast the ring into the fires of Mount Doom!"" Damn, this was such a rip-off of Lord of the Rings. -And yeah, there we have it again...all those damn unoriginal references to WW2. As Basil Fawlty would say: ""Don't mention the war!"" -There were so many moments in this movie that it seemed like the story progressed simply by chance. -The introduction of Dobby again and his utterly useless and overemotional death. He dies and the movie tries to make us feel so sad because he was such a lovable and important character...NOT! Maybe in the books, but when you've only seen the movies like I have, Dobby's not really a character that I established an emotional band with during the last six movies. -The movie took itself too serious, but that's probably what the tone of the book is too. A little more wonder and innocence would have been nice. The humor was so scarce. As The Joker said in The Dark Knight: ""Why so serious?!"" <br/><br/>All in all I just have two words for this movie...too bad! :("
"docherty98","3","123","243","15 November 2010"," Harry Potter Review
","I just got home from the official worldwide premier of the new Harry Potter movie. Overall the movie was great it had a good flow to it, you become attached to the characters and the mystical world they live in, the story has a lot of excitement to it and there is always something interesting going on. I have read all the Harry Potter books and this interpretation of the 7th and final book is very accurate and does not leave out any major detail,I know that a lot of people are upset that Warner Bros. decided to make this final book into two separate movies but maybe its better this way, it allows the viewers to get the most detail of what happens in the book, and it allows the filmmakers to express the most detail of the final chapter of the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the movie, it has a runtime of about 145mins but I went into the theatre and it felt like the movie was about 20min long. I would encourage anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter series to not hesitate, and go watch this movie and not wait until it finally releases on DVD. Overall rating 9/10"
"darkthirty","4","32","56","21 November 2010"," The worst Harry Potter film so far
","Is it part art film? I'd say yes, in the better parts, it had something wise and melancholy going for it, rather like the book, but it was lost all too easily to the infrequent action sequences which neither impress nor lend any forward motion, aside from a particular part of the Bagshot/Nagini sequence making the audience jump a couple feet, and all without Voldemort. Meh.<br/><br/>Alterations to the plot were generally as bad as they've been in the past, but the Lovegood house was so very poorly done, it rates special mention. It well and truly sucked. (I wondered if there had been some technical difficulties with the editing, it was so bad.) Most of the emotional scenes are strangely unmoving. Hermione's torture becomes something weirdly camp - Tim Burtonish, if you will - with no power to unsettle. The much anticipated horcrux destruction scene lacks any sort of nuance at all, so much so that Ron's resigned remark at the end of it falls as flat as a bassoon. Hermione looked like an airbrushed NY fashion house mascot, and Harry looked like plastic, with some silvery gloss smudged on. It was hokey, and I felt embarrassed watching it.<br/><br/>There were other bothersome things (the list could go on) - the whole imprisonment scene was horrid, rushed and thoughtless, and the basement itself looked like they were in some half-finished suburban ground floor, only thing missing was a couch, a TV and some paneling. Olivander looked far healthier than he did in the first film, Luna was an afterthought, Wormtail was apparently lulled to sleep by general uneventfulness, and Dobby looked like a wax figure moved by strings. Bellatrix was about as scary as The Count from Sesame Street, the snatchers behaved like the three stooges, and the confrontation at the end had all the movement drained from it, arranged instead like a lazy, half-hearted family portrait, just so they could end it with a hokey special effect that didn't work - the knife turning to jelly or something in the whirlwind of apparation. Dobby's death was atrociously handled, Luna spoke far too soon, and the burial was filmed in the blandest possible way.<br/><br/>The story was told in a linear way, and the camera work was too, which resulted in a very one dimensional film. The burial scene, for example, could have had a shot threw the window, with Hermione on the couch, Ron beside her, and Harry in the background or something - it would have taken no more time, but it would have filled the world better. Anything to vary the 1, 2, 3 of the telling.<br/><br/>The Story of the Three Brothers animation was very cool, and strange as it may seem to say it, Emma Watson's acting is almost the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>I liked the arty parts, but everything else is trash.<br/><br/>The film needed a new director and a new writer. I fear for part two very much now."

"coolaznthaidude","6","3","3","26 May 2011"," Might have been better if i didn't read the book
","As far as cinematic performance goes it wasn't so bad, however i can't say too much about it because i feel the bias of me being such a huge fan of the book might influence my review. However this review is meant for those hardcore harry potter fans. I was very disappointed throughout the whole movie, not that the movie was poorly done or anything, but the one thing i felt was the biggest flaw in the movie was they kind of rushed everything and they kind of left some important parts to the movie, not just in terms of story line but emotional depth that you feel when you read the book but of course this could be my bias talking. I have heard some people who haven't read the book say this movie was fantastic so i would say that the movie does somewhat compensate for the rushed story line with a fantastic movie yet i was still not completely satisfied. I understand the previous movies were made before the 7th book was even published so its difficult for the writers and producers to get in the mind of J.K rowling and put in every detail that will be important later yet i felt that those details that got left out and that were squeezed into the 7th movie kind of made it seem like in order for it to be included they had to take out some stuff. For instance they barely introduced Bill, which should have been done in the 4th movie, and they barely introduce mundungus which should have been done during the 5th movie, so we kind of lose essence what kind of character bill and mundungus are, and i feel this detail is what made the wedding in the movie seem so unimportant which was actually an important detail in the book because the wedding did a lot of stuff for the story, by having krum it introduces Ron's jealousy in the story, and also provides detail about gregorovitch the wandmaker, and shows the controversy of the mark on luna's dad's necklace and also contributes to harry's curiosity to dumbledore's life. also in the beginning scene when they're transporting harry they made hedwig dying as a giveaway to the real harry instead of the explleriamus charm in the book which is more symbolic. anyways thats just some of the things that i felt shouldn't have been changed, there are a lot more. So my advice is if you read the book don't expect this movie to match your expectations because its understandable that they have to consider the audience that doesn't read the book, but overall i guess this movie was pretty good."
"azizb_93","10","21","35","18 November 2010"," A tragic, beautiful movie with tremendous poignancy.
","Never before have I felt so immensely satisfied with a Harry Potter movie. <br/><br/>The opening sequence may be one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking moments in the series. It is absolutely gut-wrenching to see how much Voldemort (menacingly played by Ralph Fiennes) has taken over and what has to be done to protect the ones we love. I've seen the movie three times (more than any Potter movie); and this particular moment never fails to move me.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely spectacular in this movie. I'm so glad the trio stepped up their game because the movie would have collapsed had they not been up to the challenge. Emma was absolutely phenomenal; I was really quite impressed with her performance. Nuanced, poignant, and deeply affecting. She has come a very long way, and I'm grateful that she stepped up her game. Rupert was great. You could always tell in the past movies that he had potential, and it was certainly shown in this one. We get to see a very different side of Ron. Daniel gave a good performance, but he was the weakest of the three.<br/><br/>Sure enough, we get to the middle, which has been criticized by some. To me, a lot of the past movies in the series failed to capture a lot of the emotional resonance that were in the books. With Deathly Hallows 1, during the middle sequence, we are rewarded with some of the most beautiful, touching, and poignant moments in the series that define our heroes. These moments either made everyone in the theater giddy with happiness, or sad due to the losses. Deathly Hallows 1, above all else, is a coming-of-age tale, as our heroes that we have come to know and love change and develop into adults. A magnificent and highly moving evolution that was, unfortunately, sometimes sorely missing in the previous outings. Deathly Hallows 1 proves why we fell in love with witches and wizards, and it's because they're just like us, dealing with the same internal conflicts we all have gone or are going through. <br/><br/>The action sequences are excellent, and Yates has proved to be very apt at creating suspense. A lot of people jumped at one particular scene in the movie. <br/><br/>The cinematography (filmed by Eduardo Serra) is absolutely gorgeous and stunning to look at. I was in awe at the breathtaking beauty of England's countryside. Fortunately, not once did the very impressive special effects overwhelm a scene, which was very comforting. The production design is absolutely staggering, and Alexandre Desplat's haunting score blends in with the movie perfectly ('Obliviate' is one of the best tracks in the series). <br/><br/>Yates and Kloves have captured the essence of Rowling's very dark story with grace and potency, creating a movie that is extremely faithful to the source material both thematically and in content. This is by far the most satisfying movie in the series, and easily the most mature. I personally cannot see how any fan could be disappointed in it."
"jacksakes","10","8","11","21 November 2010"," Focusing on isolation and desolation, this feels far removed from Harry Potter--Yet its the best
","Yes, I am a fan of the Harry Potter series. I love it because Harry Potter has always had substance and a storyline with twists and turns to figure out as well as character development.<br/><br/>This one is by far not only the best acted, but also a gutsy move by the director, screenplay writer, and author J.K. Rowling. Never before would I think I would be going through a very bleak world chimed on by the mystical sounds that brought on the many funny moments of Hogwarts introduced in every Potter movie. The director had to choose when he made this movie and I felt he made the right one.<br/><br/>What was the choice? SPOILER ALERT-- The choice that was made was to put you in shoes of these three kids in a world gone wrong and let you feel the full emotional impact. Using things like a squelchy radio reporting all the deaths and things gone wrong in the wizarding world gave you such a withdrawn feeling that nothing is left out there for you.<br/><br/>The hopelessness that you feel is nothing any other post apocalyptic movie can touch. For this the movie is a complete success. The only other one that was close to giving me this feeling was the Road, but the Road didn't have 10 years and 6 movies built up to make you feel the intimacy you do with Weasley, Hermoine, and of course Harry.<br/><br/>Special effects (although there is still much of the brand in dueling wizards and witches as well as some chase scenes--one is even soaring above the clouds) and epic battles are sacrificed for minimalist moments of surviving in tents in undisclosed locations. The dance between Harry and Hermoine was unbelievable. It was brief and awkward, but for just a mere moment you saw the purity of children within, and how it was necessary for them to do such silly things to survive: to remember and not lose themselves.<br/><br/>Harry Potter has developed unbelievably. Not only is he more confident (no longer the kid with the glasses and the awkward smile), you really feel that he could be the champion of the story, and yet you still see how much pain and anguish he goes through. You feel his follies, you get the sense that he is utterly lost without Dumbledore. You see his anger that has culminated for the past six movies, and you see him breaking down.<br/><br/>Emma Watson as Hermoine Granger has peaked. She is showing some real acting chops in this movie. No longer is she the shrill, cracking voice, but now she has shown unbelievable conviction to her character and what she is going through.<br/><br/>Ronald Weasley of course plays a humorous role well, but he is not without his conflicts and there are some scenes that he really rises and shows that he is more than just a goofy red-headed kid you should always be laughing at. He too has his pains.<br/><br/>Spay special attention to Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. He has been given screen time only in chunks, but if you watch him closely, you'll see what a three dimensional villain he is. At first I felt they got him wrong. I expected an unstoppable force with tenacity in his calmness with the likes of Darth Vader, and now I realize that they nailed this villain so well. But he goes through his own pain and anguish in his hot pursuit of Potter and his claim to power. He too goes through a whirlwind of emotions.<br/><br/>This is an amazing movie. This not only has the special effects and action, but also the minimalist acting of art-house films. Try to take off the Harry Potter label and look at this movie just once. You'll see past the famous-infamous popularity of the franchise, and see a movie for what it really is."
"luke-693","1","15","24","21 February 2011"," Really disappointed
","In the first few books/movies, the story was light, funny, had good side story lines but carried a level of surprise and a hint of dark mystery. In the last couple of books/movies, the story line has taken a change to a more serious and dark quality. The acting is less than desirable and the villain is overly complicated making it a bit annoying to the point of unbelievability. Deathly Hollow's part I is a waste of money and time. If this was the first movie of the series, I don't think it would make it to the box office. If the Harry Potter team doesn't 'bring it' in the last part, it will ruin a great storyline."

","Dull and slow. Someone obviously realised that the money train was going to finish soon and so to cash in they split the final book into two films. They then discover that there isn't actually enough material to fill the first so have lots of sitting around on mountains - very dark, moody and ultimately annoying. Other 'fillers' include some dancing in a tent, some more sitting around on a mountain and some sitting around in a forest (to break things up). And lets not forget something to do with a mad old woman who turns into a snake - don't know what that was about or what it added to the story. Lots of people say that it's ""building up for the finale"" or ""setting the scene for part 2"". If that's the case then my advice would be to just save your money and wait for part 2, as nothing really happens in this film. Unless, of course, you like to watch people sitting around on mountains."
"PrinceKOH93","6","21","36","21 November 2010"," Lack of passion & feel in the acting, Poor directing, Dull and long winded. How did they manage that ?!
","First of all, I'm a person who has read the HP series several times over so I do know what I'm talking about. Good: <br/><br/>This is by far one of the best "" stuck to the book & plot "" harry potter movies.<br/><br/>The scenery and views are beautifully stunning most of the time ( Norwegian valleys and lakes ) but sometimes its a bit Tesco value really ( yeah i mean the bit when they're running away from the snatchers who happen to be chasing them in Bracknell, Berkshire just behind the lookout adventure park ) <br/><br/>By far the darkest potter movie so far.<br/><br/>The film is more grown up, responsibility and love of family are at heart of this film especially during turmoil in relationships. <br/><br/>This is where the good stuff ends ( yeah really not much is there )<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>This movie is over 2 and a half hours long. Thats over 150 minutes ! its not good enough to have a 5minute action scene with a bit of spell bashing and exploding dishes and furniture and then have 30 minutes of book reading or guarding a tent. Honestly at some points my eyes where wondering to corners of the screen where I was hoping i would find something more interesting. It was very dull for a lot of the time, how can they have got it so wrong??!! A dull harry potter movie? You need some skill to achieve that, heres why..<br/><br/>I felt COMPLETELY and utterly unconnected to the actors. There was no connection or chemistry between the actors and the audience, I was left completely cold. Now I know for a fact from the earlier movies that these actors CAN have a definite relationship between the audience and yet there was none, not a single scene left me emotionally connected.<br/><br/>This applies to people who haven't read the book, what was Yates thinking ?!? how creative is it to have a fight scene, then the 3 disappear to another place, wait around 30 minutes, another fight or chase then they disappear to a different location. ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS??!! what message does that send to the audience ? Yeh we've wrapped up 5 films nicely, now lets just milk the audience from their cash. Because that is exactly where this is heading, 6 was atrociously bad but at least it had some humour. This barely has that, apart from Dobby clinging onto Mungundus and a few awkwardly funny moments with Ron and Hermione the amount of humour was next to none. Yes its a much darker and more scarier ( supposedly ) than the others, but there was no tension or excitement. The build up times where almost ridiculous and when you got the peak of the tension there wasn't anything to get your heart racing, or anything you wouldn't expect. 'YAWN' a snake jumps from a whole and tries to eat harry after 10 minutes of him and Hermione creeping around in a dark house full of flies and blood 'YAWN'<br/><br/>I'm so disappointed, all the hype, all the production time and its barely better than number 6. And that is really poor because 6 was a disgrace if I'm honest. The best book was made to appeal to 14 year old girls who'd giggle at the love & relationships throughout the movie. Really if they want to step it up they have to make a 15 and actually make it gruesome and scary at times when it needs to be ! Not to have a 10 minute lead up to a snake attacking harry and biting a chair leg !!( pathetic ) <br/><br/>Finally, I cant believe at the amount of good press and reviews this has, are you all out of your mind ?! I tried to look at this in every possible way, HP fan, non HP fan, book fan, non book fan. FROM EVERY ANGLE this movie was long winded, dull, acted without enough feel & passion and poorly directed. And yes I have taken into consideration the fact this is part 1 of the book, and part 2 will definitely be more exciting, but it really seems as if they looked at the feedback from HP 6 and went ' yep the audience didn't like it when we made up stuff, lets stick to the book ' so they stuck the book in the most uncreative, utterly boring story telling fashion. There was no sparkle or anything special setting this apart from the other movies. Think about it, HP1: introduction to the world of magic, everything is new, epic set of tasks which young harry, Ron and Hermione conquered. HP 2 : Epic Quiddich and fight with the Basilisk, HP3: Epic death eater scene and true identity of Sirius. black HP4: Epic maze and Voldemorts ' reincarnation ' HP5: Epic battle, emotional death of Sirius & Dumbledores EPIC fight with Voldemort. HP6: Ehhh, epic flop ? HP7 P1: Epic directing & acting fail ?<br/><br/>MASSIVE disappointment for someone who paid in excess of ¬£15 to watch this and has eagerly waited for months.<br/><br/>5/10 is extremely generous and only awarded because I've always been a HP fan and I love the books and previous movies especially 4&5 which were fantastic. To be fair 50% doesn't even reflect the amount of money I'd pay to watch this, because If i'd known, 5 quid would've been absolute limit.<br/><br/>This is not a bash but really a set of details in what went wrong in the movie, I'm not saying I'm an expert of any sort, but really they should and they CAN do better, we have proof of that earlier on in the series. There were positives, but for a film of this magnitude, this expensive and this famous, it ought to be MUCH better."
"mrfrodogetdown","10","21","36","17 November 2010"," Unbelievable!
","I have been fan of Harry Potter books since 2001, when I first saw Philosopher's Stone in movies. I was 11 years old back then, and I thought the movie was great. One month later I saw The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring, which literally changed my life; I now study cinematography in Finland.<br/><br/>Sadly, none of the Harry Potter films have been better than the first one, which is still a great movie, but very childish. As the books became darker and better book by book, the films remained childish. To me, Half-blood Prince was an awful film: I didn't like the way how there were scenes that weren't in the books, like stupid jokes and the burning of The Burrow. Especially I was irritated by the way there were some great scenes missing, like Voldemort's memories.<br/><br/>But now, in The Deathly Hallows the movie series has finally reached the stage it should have been since The Goblet of Fire. It is absolutely great! As a movie, there's only one word for it: unbelievable. Cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is breath-taking (I gave this part of the making a lot of thought as it will be my occupation someday). Director has done good job with everything. Music fits well to the scenes and Daniel Radcliffe shows finally his talents as an actor. Visual effects are great, and they gave me some serious goosebumps. The best thing in the movie is that there are not many scenes that were not in the book. Those that are, are actually pretty good jokes that fit well to the story. All the main parts of the novel are there, which was nice. Only few things made me annoyed (like Wormtail, and the actor of Bill Weasley, who was not ""cool"" as Harry described him in the books). Also a good thing was that the movie was actually bit scary, even to me - and I'm 20. Bathilda Bagshot was creepy and the Horcrux scene was gorgeous in a strange way.<br/><br/>All in all, this is by far easily the best part of the HP series as a film and as a book. It's so good it deserves 10 stars out of 10, and I even dare say it's one of the best films made in few years. It is absolutely one of the best fantasy/ sci-fi films ever made. I wish the next July would be here already..."

","What a crap movie. Just returned from watching Happy Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's dull, long and boring.<br/><br/>It starts out looking interesting, and then they end up spending an hour in a tent doing nothing. There's a weak attempt at fleshing out the characters, but it's woeful.<br/><br/>The story is a mish-mash where nothing really happens. It's so badly put together. Oh, they destroy an horcrux, and find a sword, but it's so drawn out and boring. There's no adventure or excitement. All the interesting characters of the recent films vanish, and you're left with Potter, Granger and Weasley wandering about not really doing anything.<br/><br/>I thought maybe they'd use the extra time to develop the story, but they didn't. Or couldn't. Maybe the screenwriter wasn't good enough. Whatever the reason, he's turned out a pathetic piece of work. For instance *SPOILER AHEAD*, they say that the place Harry is hiding is well protected, and it would be ""impractical"" to attack him there, and then they just turn up and attack anyway and trash the place. I mean, hello?!<br/><br/>There's a few jokes and comic relief, which is welcome, although sparse. The best scene in the whole film is when they try to infiltrate the Ministry. Great acting by those involved, but once it's over it goes back to being limp and dull. Some action, although not much. The SFX isn't interesting. Death Eaters fly around etc, but that's about it.<br/><br/>As usual, it's pretty poorly scripted. I've enjoyed the Harry Potter movies, but they're badly written. They eschew actual narrative and just throw scenes at you with little or no set-up. They're not hard to follow, but you're just left wishing that they'd tried a little harder.<br/><br/>Well, in HP7 Part 1, they don't really try at all. It's obvious that they just want to make as much money as they can (as if the other 6 haven't been profitable enough), but this movie just sucked.<br/><br/>It's got some darker tones to it, as fitting with the progress of the other films, but it's a two torture scenes than any real foreboding menace.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 for the following reasons. Dull, with very little action. About 20 minutes of actual story all up. Way, way too long. They've stretched 90 minutes of film into 2.5 hours. The 90 minute film would've been great. The 2.5 hour film drags and drags and sucks and sucks. Finally, even knowing that it is just a blatant money grab, they didn't even give us a decent film. Poor effort all round. The director and writer should be ashamed of themselves."

","My first attempt in watching this movie I fell asleep. The second attempt was more successful as I managed to stay awake. But what on earth did I just see. The first three HP movies were mysterious and magical. And as Harry matured he became stronger and skilled. After the third movie the Harry we see on the screen is nothing but a plot device. He is nowhere near as impressive and no match at all for any bad guy,in a believable way that is. So I haven't read the books,something tells me I do need to do that. But I should not read the books to make sense of it all. I judge solely on what I see on the screen. Why would the Dark Lord be so afraid of Harry Potter. Not once an explanation is given for it which I believe the books do (somebody told me). It really is beyond me that people can call this the best Harry Potter movie ever. Excuse me? Was there actually a plot? The scenes that were interesting were over before I could get into it. Please give this a miss. It is a waste of time."

You can see some movement, but you sure can't tell what is going on. We thought it must have been filmed in a cave.The parts we did see were good. Good acting as always, but it looked like Ron Weasley was working with 2 black eyes most of time. I don't understand why anyone would want to film a movie this way. It was almost like they were ashamed of the film, so darken it. We have purchased every Harry Potter movie and were extremely disappointed in this one.

"Green_Saturn","4","6","8","11 December 2010"," Brutal to those who never read the books
","Firstly, the only reason I saw this was because, some way or another, I have seen all the other films in this series. I never read the books; I tried but found them mind-numbingly boring. I am not one for fantasy wizards in England.<br/><br/>Why is everyone acting like Daniel Radcliffe is God's gift to the earth? He has two faces in this entire film: angry and bored. Ugh. Ron isn't much better, and he looks a lot less disheveled in the previous films. He knows what shampoo is, right? Hermione wasn't as bad; Emma Watson is clearly a better actor than her co-stars. That being said, she deserves a better role than the girl-from-the-first-movie-who-was-really-dorky-that-we-all-think- Harry-is-going-to-sleep-with-by-the-end-of-this-film.<br/><br/>I felt bad for all the Potter fans around me. I kept laughing at parts that aren't meant to be funny. They kept glaring at me, but I couldn't help it! The director obviously made no effort to explain any Potter-isms not explained in the previous movies. I literally sat through two and a half hours of mindless mumbo-jumbo. Why can't Voldemort (Ooooh! I said 'Voldemort'! Are the death eaters going to kill me? No. They aren't. Voldemort isn't real.) just hire some pimps to shoot Harry? And what's with all the wizards hating 'muggles'? I think it's pretty cool being normal!<br/><br/>The CGI wasn't terrible and I had a good laugh.

","Completely lacking in imagination, storytelling, and cinematography, this is the worst I have seen in the series.<br/><br/>Aside from the first 15 and last 15 minutes, The Hallows is the most boring and badly presented to date. I understand character development and a sub story was going on during this portion, but it is so blatantly spoon fed and boring it was borderline offensive. Characters should be developed by following them through a story, not by stopping (or slowing) the story to develop the character! As for audience appeal I can say only this: being a PG-13 movie with such dark and sexual overtones the dialog and presentation feels aimed at the intellect of a 6 year old audience.<br/><br/>Further, the way that characters just hop in and out of scenes, unannounced, and unexplained ruined most every major action sequence for me.<br/><br/>The three main characters can't ever figure anything out on their own or spot obvious traps. They just dumbly wander from dangerous situation to the next while trying not to unravel simple clues. They are constantly bailed out by random characters showing up at just the right random time and place. I didn't read this book, but I have read a few, and the author seems to describe the situations and traps as subtle and tricky. The director failed at this concept completely.<br/><br/>They should not have split this into two movies, and I honestly hope, when I watch part 2 at home, the director pulls his production team, editing, and writing together for something that makes sense and serves to fill more then just time. This movie was terrible and a waste of time!"

","Worst of the Harry Potter series. The biggest problem to me seems that they wanted to save money on effects and actors by spending endless amount of time shooting outdoor forest fly-by scenes instead of including side plots and more special effects. The movie has about 30 minutes of outdoor scenes which could be completely removed. Also, there's a scene where Harry and Hermione dance that is supposed to be poignant, but I found it endless and pointless. I can't remember the last time I saw a non-musical movie which included a complete song. Usually they are shortened to show the highlights and move the story along, but not Deathly Hallows. I'll definitely not be too worried about buying the extended DVD! I'd actually pay extra for a better edited version."
"jburtroald95","10","9","14","21 November 2010"," It wasn't Hogwarts we were attached to, it was the people inside, or Deathly Hallows wouldn't be so unspeakably brilliant!
","The most potent of the established rhythmic norms surrounding the previous six Harry Potter films was the inclusion of a stirring occurrence at the beginning to get things going, a more sedate and steadily-paced poignant build-up in the middle and a very rewarding climax at the end. This winning format also applies to the series as a whole: Philosopher's Stone serves as an introduction, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire push the saga along with great gusto, Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince reflect the escalating tensions and finally the two Deathly Hallows films bring things to a stunningly satisfying riveting conclusion. Fans have followed the series as the characters, the films, the books, the iconic actors and they themselves have matured bit by wondrous bit, and now they deserve a final stupendous culmination.<br/><br/>For those who have never read a word of J.K Rowling's writings, the first half of Voldemort's villainous endeavour to secure a total domination over the wizarding world and its often courageous but mostly desperate opposing struggle to his power is powerfully conveyed. Those familiar with the story will be impressed by the wonderful performances given by the always-dependable cast, as well as the very pleasing depiction of all of the key exciting and engaging events. For the entire audience, there are plenty of thrilling moments that masterfully manipulate the senses, most notably Nagini's truly terrifying leap at the camera after Voldemort's kills one of his helpless victims and says ""dinner."" Swathed in a sinister sense of genuine danger, fearful secrets, conflicting emotions, intoxicating adrenalin and occasional effective comic relief, it is a must-see contemporary masterpiece that children can actually see. <br/><br/>Directed by David Yates, the best of the Harry Potter directors, it of course stars that lovable trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as well as the brilliant Ralph Fiennes, with Imelda Staunton and Helena Bonham Carter making memorable appearances."

Many scenes are just plain boring with little magic and little conversation, it's actually quite depressing with not much going on.<br/><br/>When the movie finally ended I just gazed at the screen thinking: 'did anything funny just happen?'. No. I feel the actors also played on autopilot. It's as if you can tell when someone will react in a way on certain events. I also think there were some parallels with Lord of the rings.

","I was one of the many that were dragged along by a die hard fan. I have been made to watch all previous films and despite not having read the books I still found them enjoyable enough. But the Deathly Hallows part 1 broke the mould. It was a complete waste of time. I felt at times like I was watching a documentary about some bored kids camping in the woods. The whole film could neatly have been summarised in a conversation at the start of the second film so I can only conclude this film was purely driven by financial greed. While a book can get away with this vast periods of inactivity I'm afraid if you haven't read the book then it is incredibly tedious in a film. Unlike previous films, nothing really happens. I often go to the cinema and afterwards we discuss our ""favourite"" scenes. When we left this film someone asked me what I enjoyed about it and I actually struggled to think of something that happened that I could talk about it. My advice, if you haven't read the books, skip this and wait for Part 2 which I assume will be better. I did ask for my money back but I will never get those 3 hours back."

""Dobbin"" I think his name is, was more powerful than Harry Potter, the supposedly mighty wizard, and unlike the said wizard, was able to teleport himself out of the dungeon everyone else was locked in.<br/><br/>""Dobbin"" was also able to protect Harry a number of times, including in a previous movie, so I guess that is why he got killed off at the end of this film, as otherwise he would have spoilt it for Harry in the next movie - we couldn't have him keep saving Harry could we.<br/><br/>I found myself shouting ""Use your magic"" over and over when they were being chased by the ""Snatchers"", and once again, was puzzled why, after all those years at Hogwarts, Harry still relies on his feet rather than waving his wand.<br/><br/>Normally when a film is really bad, I find it hard to write the ten lines IMDb requires, but with this movie, there is so much glaringly bad, that I've found this exercise extremely easy.<br/><br/>No more Harry Potter for me!"
"arorasugam","10","2","2","15 January 2020"," The Best and Most Underrated Harry Potter Movie
","I would like to start off by saying that I am reviewing this movie as simply a movie - none of my opinions here will be associated with the book, and I will not discuss whether or not this film is a good adaptation of the book.
If I had to pick a Harry Potter movie to watch at any given time, I will always suggest this film due to how different it is from every other film in the franchise. It is an excellent movie, not just in the Harry Potter series, but in general due to its cinematography, score, tone, and emotion.
The tone of this movie follows the trend of the films getting progressively darker as they go on, with this film by far being the most depressing yet. Similar to the Half Blood Prince, this film has a dark tint to it, which I think was needed considering the light hearted nature of the first few films. It reminds us that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer kids, and the world is falling apart day by day. The stakes are higher than ever for the Golden Trio as Voldemort rages on.
One of the biggest reasons I love this movie is because its main focus is on the trio, and there is some really good character development here. Ron gets some serious development for once, as we see him explain to a naive Harry that the war against Voldemort is bigger than just him and his world early on. We also see him struggle with the pressure and frustration of the trio's quest to destroy the Horcruxes, and the scene where he returns to Hermione and Harry is quite heart warming. We get to see Hermione try her best to be the glue of the group while Harry and Ron fight it out, but we soon see the stress of their situation get to her as well. It is amazing to see how far the three main characters have grown, and Grint, Watson, and Radcliffe give their best performances yet.
This film has some of the best scenes in the series. I think the wedding sequence was done very well (despite somewhat cringe dialog between Harry and an old woman), as it reminds you that the main cast don't have any time for celebrations anymore. The following scene in a Muggle restaurant was shot stunningly, and the absence of any score really immerses you into the scene.The Ministry of Magic sequence is genuinely hilarious (Ron gets a little too into character), and is every bit enjoyable as it is thrilling towards the end when the three attempt to escape the Ministry. I love every moment of our trio's camping trip, and there are some really gorgeous landscape shots used as transitions. The chase scene through the forest is exhilarating, and again, the lack of score in the scene is gripping. The tales of the three brothers was beautifully animated, and is an example of the several risks that David Yates took in this film. The scene where Harry and Hermione stand in the Godric's Hollow graveyard is one of the best in the series and is quite touching.
A lot of people dislike the infamous Harry and Hermione dance scene, but honestly, I thought it was great. It's an incredibly sad scene as we see how depression has struck our main characters; Harry and Hermione try their best to remember happiness after the devastating loss of their best friend, but it quickly fades as the two snap back to the reality of their depressing situation.
The main criticism of this film seems to be that ""it's too slow"" or ""not much happens"", but I would argue that the people who make these comments are missing the point of this movie. This movie is less about the action and more about who Harry, Ron, and Hermione are as people and how they cope with their struggles (even though the action in this movie is great. It's a depressing film, and there are a lot of long shots of the three characters talking to each other because that's the point of this movie. The characters are depressed, finding the Horcruxes seems impossible to them, and as a viewer you experience their frustration. I feel like the production team easily could have made an action packed final film instead of splitting the last two books, but I'm glad they didn't because it allowed for excellent character moments. I am glad that Yates didn't simply go for the easy way out, and that he wasn't afraid to make a slower paced film. And no, this movie wasn't a ""cash grab"", because it is simply too good of a film to be.
Lastly, I would like to point out that there is and never will be a franchise of the size of the Harry Potter series where all the films are at least decent movies on their own (some of them being outstanding). You will never see another blockbuster series eight films long that has as much artistic integrity as the eight Harry Potter movies, and that's what makes the Harry Potter films so special."

After just reading the book for the second time, I can safely say that I would have been mostly lost if I hadn't read it.<br/><br/>The movie's pacing is all over the place. The first third has a very brisk pace, but then it slows down a LOT in the middle, but to be fair that's how it went in the book too. Then it finally starts to pick up again near the end. This is also, put simply, a road movie with Harry, Ron, and Hermione out to find the remaining horcruxes, while camping in many different locations and getting themselves in one situation after another. Some of these situations were pretty downplayed compared to the book, but some, such as the Malfoy manor scene were handled much better.<br/><br/>What more can you say about Harry, Ron, and Hermione at this point? This movie is all about them, more than any of the other movies. However, this does give them nice moments of character development. Of course many other characters make appearances, but they are only around for 1 or 2 scenes.<br/><br/>The film has a dark and tight feel to it. Many scenes are filmed very up close and some are so dark I could barely see what's going on, which took a lot of impact out of those scenes (you think they would use that Lumos spell more often). However the set pieces, such as the forest, for the most part look nice.<br/><br/>This is not my favorite movie in the series. It fact it might not even make the top 3, but still it could be worse. I'm just glad I read the book first."

","""Harry! Hermione! Ron!""<br/><br/>I joked with some friends on the way to the theater that the preceding utterances would likely sum up the bulk of the dialogue in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. You see, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the feature films that have sought to transform J.K. Rowling's vision of witchcraft and wizardry into a viable cinematic franchise have been‚Äîin my estimation‚Äîdry, predictable, and not all that engaging. Here, where we experience ""the beginning of the end,"" it's clear that director David Yates was able to harness some of the energy and urgency that fueled his previous offering. ""Some,"" of course, is the key word. Though the movie is book-ended by some admirably crafted action sequences that effectively immerse us in the far-flung world of wands, potions and evil lords, the middle sags, as Langston Hughes would say, ""like a heavy load.""<br/><br/>Our protagonists' interactions have become increasingly complex as they've aged, and that's pushed to the next level in Deathly Hallows. No longer are Harry and company holding hands and exchanging superficial banter with those of the opposite sex: here, we see our hero exude confidence (and, perhaps, maturity) as he goes straight for a kiss right from the get-go. In fact, sexual tension courses through nearly every scene of the production. There's even an odd occurrence where we witness the feigned lustful encounter of some familiar characters via a mysterious vapor.<br/><br/>Given their age, this isn't all that surprising, and it ultimately adds some believability to the maturation unfolding before us. On the flip side, this also means that we're exposed to a number of drawn-out sequences that seem more like forced characterization rather than anything truly genuine.<br/><br/>And this is where the problems begin for Deathly Hallows. After a grand opening, we're forced to endure an hour (or so) of watching moody teenagers meander through the wilderness. They're searching for horcruxes‚Äîthese objects are the key to defeating Voldemort (I think)‚Äîand the location and purpose of each one is shrouded in mystery (surprise!).<br/><br/>Naturally, it takes a lot of interviewing and pondering for the necessary revelations to take place, but they eventually do, and we're treated to a third act that's vastly more entertaining than anything that comes before.<br/><br/>A few other notes: hints of Lord of the Rings abound, especially when a horcrux on a chain acts as a burden for each of our protagonists. Just as we've seen with the ""one ring"" in Middle Earth, this item brings out the worst in its bearer. And, as one of my students noted in a recent essay submission, there are some blatant comparisons made between Lord Voldemort to Adolf Hitler (and subsequently Nazi Germany). I don't necessarily mind this, but anyone familiar with popular culture or world history might find the preaching of Rowling a little heavy-handed.<br/><br/>As stated in my review of Half-Blood Prince, I have not read any of the novels. I'm told that much of what we see in Deathly Hallows is important to further fleshing out our heroic trio, and I'm willing to chalk up what I can only describe as ""tedium"" to screenwriter Steve Kloves desire to remain faithful to the source material.<br/><br/>But the question remains: for this to be the start of a slam-bang finish, couldn't something have been done to make it a little more¬Ö I don't know¬Ö magical?"

","This particular movie possesses many admirable qualities. Fine acting, exciting storyline etc. But for me the poor quality lighting of many crucial scenes out weighs all else and because of this I would give this movie a poorer than average rating. What good does all the rest mean,if you can't make out the picture? I watched the movie in high definition blue ray and scene after scene the lighting was terrible. I realize that the action took place after dark. Time after time I could not make out what was going on. I believe that the makers of this film and all of Harry Potter movies would be well served if they gave proper illumination to the scenes. I realize England can be drab and dreary, that wizards wear black and that they teach in Hogwart's dark chambers but consideration should be given to the viewer. I give you as an example, in the case of audio, how many of you have seen a movie in which within a scene horrendous noise is occurring, bombs are going off etc.? Yet, within the scene two lovers speak, perhaps one dying in the arms of the other and there is utter silence in the background as they speak. You are allowed to hear their conversation (literary license?)(perhaps need to tell the story). In the same way, the Potter franchise has often suffered with trying to set the scene with realistic light when what was needed was enough light for the viewer to make out the subject matter. Do others see it my way?"
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","2","2","24 August 2011"," I wanted to like it, but it was tediously boring
","In an attempt recreate the feeling of watching Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I'm going to review it in a dreadfully long, boring, tedious, complaining sort of way.<br/><br/>I have not read the sacred text. Having seen every movie thus far, this is how I see it going: We've got Harry Potter, the chosen one who has the power to defeat Volder.. Voltra¬Ö the bad guy, who slowly regenerates and becomes fully evil and powerful. Just like Sauron. So Frodo has to find the sacred Horcruxi that bind Sauron to the tower in Mordor and destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor. All the while Samwise's relationship with Hermione causes tension when Fro-er Harry appears in a vision all naked and foggy snogging her beside a Goblet of Fire. Give me a break here. It's been 10 years since the first film and I'm not doing a 7 film refresher to watch yet another Harry Potter movie. Having not read the books, I did expect some kind of, you know, climax. A big battle, fire, dragons, all the magic stops pulled out!! INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC, DO YOUR WORST! Except they didn't do the effects on this film¬Ö<br/><br/>I did a breakdown on number of pages, number of movie minutes, total budget, and total gross box office take - yes, I correlated a bunch of unrelated types of data. What I noticed was budget is about the same, box office is about the same, but a sharp jump in page numbers is where the film series lost me ‚Äì right about at Goblet of Fire. Confusing, spotty, lots of ""oh you should have read the book"" responses to my questions. At least Dune came with a pocket guide of terminology. It's been downhill from here, but in my naive hopefulness, I was expecting something better. Darkest film ever, I was told. Exciting conclusion so bedwettingly incredible, we had to release it in two parts, they said.<br/><br/>Not so! Dark because I was asleep. Bedwettingly dull, if you ask me. I think one of my biggest problems with the films (""should have read the book!"") was a distinct lack of a cohesive timeline. See, there are things called ""script days"" you have to account for when you're in preproduction to decide costuming, locations, weather, time of year, etc. The ""hiding out"" portion of the film supposedly happened over a period of weeks or months (according to THE BOOK). When your characters are wearing the same costumes day in and day out (what, they can conjure up a tent, but not some new clothes?), you don't have a clue how long they've been in the woods and which locations are miles away or right next door or reachable by magic only. Quoi? I felt dragged through haphazard storyline that had dozens of locations, but still meandered on for hours on end. I would have preferred to get it over with in one 6 hour sitting. I did it for the Dune TV series ‚Äì twice. I can take it.<br/><br/>You've got to make some cuts when it comes to filming. Film makers are not servicing anybody when they create an overdrawn, boring movie. The book readers will always always ALWAYS hate the movie version anyway so why pander to them? Make it fun to watch. Lord of the Rings made some tough choices, but I think we can all agree Tom Bombadil wasn't missed in the least. Result: long, but great movies and 15 Oscars.<br/><br/>Oh, the Oscars! Let's make a wild prediction about that, shall we? Nine nominations, no wins. At least Lord of the Rings got 4 of 13 on the 1st one and 11 of 11 on the 3rd. Is the Academy saving up? Is Part 2 really going to be so good that they can create the illusion that they're rewarding just that movie and not the entire series? I've heard complaints about being misled by Portman's dancing abilities and how it swayed voting for Black Swan, but there are no qualms with rewarding a sub-par movie for the accomplishments of movies past? Mark my words, one reader that actually made it this far in my review, there will be Oscars a-plenty for everybody. This is not the year to release your shining gem, because you've got a spoon's chance in the fork drawer of winning.<br/><br/>I wanted to like Part 1, I really did! Enough time passes that I feel excited again and forget I couldn't stand the last installment. They've only given me 7 month to recover and I can't say I'm too excited any more. Let's get it over with, like this review."

","These Harry Potter movies are starting to make me grumpy.<br/><br/>Coming out of ""Half-Blood Prince,"" I felt that the filmmakers didn't even try to make the film coherent to people who hadn't already read the book, and that trend continues with the first half of ""Deathly Hallows."" To make matters worse, all fun and whimsy have been drained out of this story, so not only was I confused, I was also depressed. The who's who of adult British actors that have been the only reason to stick with this series in the first place are mostly absent, save for an initial action sequence that stands as this film's highlight. It all goes downhill from there, and most of the movie consists of Harry, Hermione and Ron (and mostly just Harry and Hermione), sitting around in barren, rocky places looking gloomy. (If the kids can whisk themselves away anywhere, why don't they at least go into hiding someplace warm and sunny?) These characters simply aren't interesting enough to carry an entire film, and the absence of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Brendan Gleeson (who bites it off screen early on but whose death is treated so casually by the script that you might not even know he died), David Thewlis, etc. is sorely missed.<br/><br/>The film's production values and sheer technical skill are enough to mask the fact that the script doesn't make any sense, and it's not until after the movie is over and you've had a chance to ruminate on it that you begin to feel like you've been snowed.<br/><br/>I will see the final installment because I might as well now, but it damn well better be good.<br/><br/>Grade: C"
"bangar1991","5","2","2","5 April 2011"," Left too many important details!
","I have read all the Harry Potter books, so I am familiar with the finer points of the plot. I am amazed at how people say that the film is faithful to the book. In my humble point of view, the movie really meandered here and there without providing any logical reasons for the actions of characters. OK here come the SPOILERS. The starting was good with the music of Desplat setting the tone for the impending dark times. But all the good work was undone for me with the scene for Harry looking into the broken mirror. He sees(or thinks he has seen) the face of Dumbledore and yet he is not even surprised..as if he has been seeing this every other day, it actually makes him look dumb. It is an important scene which links to later part of the movie. The chase scenes are pretty good but again, as Hedwig gives away Harry's identity (another departure from book) and Voldemort draws nearer, the spell his wand casts automatically seems to pass unnoticed by him (I said he's dumb..well,he's dumber). Boy, he never even asks anyone why did this happen. Given, he is dumb, is anyone sane enough to advise him to be in disguise during the wedding...apparently not. He just walks in full view and guess what, nobody's even surprised. I thought they might give Harry the credit of solving the mystery of RAB to show the brainy side of him but no, its Ron who just happens to wake up and show his rare genius. The story of Kreacher being used by Voldemort to the cave to hide his horcrux and the change of heart Kreacher had when the trio told him they were completing the unfinished task of Regulus Black was completely skipped. I think there was a lot of potential for laughs with the elf beating Mundungus but it too was wasted. Our dumb harry refuses to have any disguise on their trip to Godric's hollow as well though this time Hermione tried to put some saneness into his head but to no avail.(It would be better if Voldemort just kills this loser, he seem to be asking for it!). I was really astonished how far a character can be made to look foolish when Harry follows the doe Patronus without ever wondering who cast it and it may be a trap. But the biggest mystery I am yet to uncover is how those death eaters happened to be at the same place they disapparated to from Luna's house...they didn't even utter the tabooed ""Voldemort"" name.(Surely something to look for in part 2, perhaps?). I dunno why but Bellatrix wont use Cruciatus curse to torture Hermione but instead carves Mudblood on her arm and why did Hermione cry out so loud for this? After all, Harry bore all such trash in part 5 without any issues. They skipped the death of Wormtail as well. There really was no conviction and desperation in the way Harry takes out the broken mirror and asks for help. No doubt people do not seem to relate it to appearance of Dobby. There was a lot more missing in the movie but what really disgusts me is the way the director took liberty with some very important scenes that were vital to explaining the forthcoming events.<br/><br/>That said, the infiltration into ministry was the scene I enjoyed the most and was well done. The animation of the fairy tale was a pleasant surprise. The dance scene between Harry and Hermione could have been skipped in favor of some of the scenes like Dudley saying goodbye to Harry. Really, the time wasted in those beautiful landscapes could have served instead in developing the story and characters more fully. The film shines in parts but collectively, it somewhat loses its appeal. It is neither appealing from cinematic pt. of view nor does it satisfy the readers of the book. Must watch if you are a Harry potter fan like me but be warned, you may feel as unsatisfied with it as I did."
"jfgibson73","6","2","2","24 December 2010"," Don't Know How I Felt About This Movie
","I really wasn't sure what to feel watching this movie. Having read the book, I knew the story, who the characters where, and what was going to happen. But it was still emotionally confusing. There isn't really a moment in this movie where you're allowed to fully feel the moment of what is happening. For every moment that should be happy or triumphant, such as Ron breaking the horcrux, you immediately have a scene reminding the characters of the sobering reality of their situation. The story piles on hardship after hardship. The action move very fast, with some of the sequences I enjoyed in the book going by so quick I didn't feel like I had the chance to savor them and look for all the details I had waited for (the first chase when Harry leaves home, for example). And that's pretty much how it continued. And actually that's basically how the book went. So you can say that this movie was extremely faithful to the source material, probably as much as any film adaption ever has been. I think I was maybe looking for the movie to provide something that the book didn't--maybe to help me realize how I felt about this story which just seemed to happen, without allowing me to feel a proper release after all the buildup. I am excited for part 2, even knowing how everything will turn out, but this time I won't expect the film to solve any of my issues for me."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","2","2","25 November 2010"," Deathly Loss of Innocence
","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the Chosen One, and his best friend Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) huddle together in the snow covered forest her Muggle parents took her as a young child. Hermione confides that these woods are as she remembered, but ""We have changed"". Much has changed in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"". Gone are the days of innocence and the wonder of youth in the pursuit of true magic. ""Deathly Hallows"" veers dour and menacing. The Dark Lord Voldemort (charismatic evil Ralph Fiennes) declares, ""I shall be the one to kill Harry Potter!"" In this dark envisioning of J.K. Rowling's final book: It is now ""time to put away childish things"". David Yates expertly directs this, and the concluding Part 2, as he did in the previous 2 movies. ""Deathly Hallows"" is more craft than art.<br/><br/>We have all witnessed the journey of Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) through the last 10 years and 6 books. Our children have grown up literally before our eyes. Director Yates is craftsman-like in his creation beholding to Steve Kloves's screenplay laden with precision. I have not read the Rowling's books. My bud Chuck told me that this movie is very loyal to the book‚Äîmaybe painfully so. Although Yates's creation is sturdy and captivating, he is not creating art. The score by Alexandre Desplat elicits the gravity and significance of the story. Yates and Kloves's narrative is by the numbers, lacking an edge or sense of foreboding danger. Yates fails to leverage the most enticing dynamic of all: Whom does Hermione truly love? Ron? Harry? Singer Sting once said the most interesting love songs are about ""I love you. You love someone else."" This also seems to be a glaring void.<br/><br/>Our young transforming heroes must risk all to protect avatar Harry, and check Voldemort from possessing the triad of the Deathly Hallows; thus making him ""master of death"". ""Harry Potter"" has always embodied love and humanity. The narrative is ambitious in making palatable the vast amount of source material, and converging upon the eternal battle of good against evil. However, we don't get much insight into Harry, Ron, and Hermione‚Äîcharacters we have all grown to love. Granted this is not the concluding act of this saga.<br/><br/>This is too bad, given that all have evolved into wonderful actors. Particularly, Emma Watson displays a self-aware loss of innocence and lonely sadness as Hermione. She is the emotional anchor as Harry expands into the hero he is fated. Daniel Radcliffe is both commanding and vulnerable as Harry. He nuances Harry's fear of his own darkness. He must reconcile whether he is savior or merciless avenger. Voldemort killed his parents, and in twisted way defined Harry. Harry suffers the guilt of being powerless to stop Severus Snape (strong Alan Rickman) from killing his mentor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Radcliffe holds his own with the powerful Fiennes. Surprisingly, Harry does not say anything memorable as the emerging hero at this juncture. Grint as Ron tires of being Harry's sidekick. Grint does his best to elevate Ron beyond the angst ridden teen finding his path and embracing true love, possibly with Hermione.<br/><br/>In ""Deathly Hallows"" our heroes leave the security of Hogwarts behind, and venture into the chaotic and unforgiving world. Lead by Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and ""Mad Eye"" Moody the young wizards and witches risk their lives to protect Harry from Voldemort and his minions, until Harry turns 17 years old. A malevolent conspiracy is brewing. Lord Voldemort has vanquished vestiges of his soul into vessels called Horcruxes, ensuring his immortality. Hermione uncovers Voldemort scheme, and determines that they must destroy all the Horcruxes. In the balance is Voldemort's emergence as omniscient master of death and vanquisher of the Chosen One‚ÄîHarry. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" has striking action and visuals; however, it is deathly slow for the first half. The movie redeems itself toward the end.<br/><br/>However, this may be more the calm before the storm and the concluding chapter. The ""Deathly Hallows"" is calculated and sturdy, but lacks a sense of wonder and magic that made the series classic. Perhaps, Part 2 risks and challenges all."

I steeled myself: ""Just get through it‚Äîthe final one will be GREAT."" Well, I'm kind of disappointed that I wasn't disappointed. After all, the final book in the series is definitely not one of my favorites, and I knew the almost total absence of Snape, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts would certainly diminish this film. What we're left with is Harry, Hermione, and Ron on the run for almost the entire film, with prolonged cameos by heretofore minor characters. But what this set-up does (and more effectively than the book does, I might argue) is foreground the relationship among these characters and how it has evolved throughout the series. There is nothing childish about their complex entanglements with each other, and the intensity of their performances (especially Rupert Grint's) is very impressive. The film is, by necessity, incomplete‚Äîthe conclusion is more like a dramatic pause.

","It was unbearably boring, for nearly an hour & a half its just Harry & Hermione walking around & talking, not even talking about anything important. Every other character in the movie just shows their face once each then leaves, little to no dialogue at all. The entire film focused (if you can call it that! Most the camera work was jumpy & unfocused!) On Hermione & Harry w/ Ron kinda just hanging around not doing much. Too many unanswered questions they didn't bother to even try to explain, little to no new information at all was given, then it just up & ends out of no where. I know this was meant to be a tease to bring you back for the last one but if I wasn't a fan of the series I most likely wouldn't come back. It was a slap in the face to all the fans & an insult to all the other films. From what I saw you could basically skip this one & move right on to the last one without skipping a beat or getting angry and mad like I did. I've really liked all the other movies but this one was God awful & I do blame the director, just another example of Hollywood politics sticking it's nose where it doesn't belong. Clearly it was a ploy to create a money grab situation and completely ignore any effort to make a quality film. I've noticed even in the previews they show scenes that aren't even IN this movie but the next one. Making people, I'm sorry SHEEPLE, think their getting something they're not. Pathetic, simply pathetic. It made some bank over the weekend so it fooled acres of sheep.

","I'll start by saying i love the books and I'm impartial to the movies, but i thought this one would be different. Seeing as how they split it in to two parts i thought that would allow them to stay detailed and true to the book, this was not the case at all. Okay, so we all know that movies are never as good as the books that they are based on mainly because they tend to leave out the small details, but this movie completely betrayed the book. They missed so many plot forming concepts that the story seemed almost patched together, making many things forced upon the viewer in the form of awkwardly place bad script. I'll begin with my list of a few of the many things that they screwed up.<br/><br/>1:The Taboo on Voldemort's name was never mentioned, which was the entire reason that they were followed by death eaters at the Cafe and more importantly it was the reason they were captured by the Snatchers, so... wtf? 2:The Invisibility Cloak was completely missing from the movie, and in the book that's the only reason that they believe that the Hallows exist, and seeing how the title is the Deathly Hallows, you think that would be a little more important.<br/><br/>3:An extremely important part in the book is in the beginning when Voldemort attacks Harry as they are leaving the Dursley's and Harry's wand acts on its own accord. They did a TERRIBLE job with that scene in the movie not showing it as the wand's action at all 4:Also from the beginning, Harry and Hagrid were supposed to almost die in the crash, instead they have a nice smooth landing at the burrow, when they were actually supposed to crash at Ted Tonk's.<br/><br/>5: Krum is never in the movie to explain the symbol of the Hallows, and they magically (no pun intended) figure it out.<br/><br/>6: Wormtail didn't even die, really? how hard would that have been to just throw in there real quick? 7: they tried to make a hint towards a romantic relationship between Harry and Hermione which never happens in the book, except for maybe when Ron is Trying to Destroy the locket and Riddle's spirit shows Ron's fears 8:When Harry sees into Voldemort's mind its split second clips inside a dream, in the book they are vivid and complete visions of Voldemort's actions allowing you to know what was going on without one of the characters just stating it.<br/><br/>I know there's a lot of things that i'm forgetting, not to mention all the small mistakes. This is the first movie in a long time that i was debating leaving the theater. But all of that aside, the movie itself was pretty poorly scripted at times (probably as a result of them leaving so much out) the visual aspect of the movie was good, but these days with a budget like that you can do anything. For those that haven't read the books i guess you won't be as upset as i was but its still a slow storyline sure to bore. THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE MOVIE THAT DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO DOING JUSTICE TO THE BOOK, do yourself a favor and skip going to see this one."

I was lucky enough to get passes to an advance screening last night.

A lot of people are going to complain that it is slow and boring but I will say this now, if you have not read the book or are not a fan of the series, you will NOT like this movie or will have a hard time following it. it relies heavily on story and heavily on the struggle and isolation on these three characters as their on their own away from the protection of hogwarts and dumbledore now that he has died and have to find these horcruxes on their own to destroy voldemort and save the wizarding world.<br/><br/>The film opens with Rufus Scrimgor the ministry of magic addressing the press assuring everyone everything's okay in these dark times, then shows Hermionie leaving her house for good and olbiviating her parents memories which is quite touching then the Dursley's leaving privet drive for the last time as harry awaits the arrival of the order to get moved to a safe location. followed by voldemort and his death eaters planing on capturing harry. he makes it safely to the burrow in an exciting chase sequence where someone dies, then the wedding of bill and Fleur where harry discoverers info about Dumbledore's past and the necklace around Xenophilus Lovegoods neck. then the ministry falls, death eaters attack and the trio Apparate and begin their journey alone. from this point is almost exact from the book with changes here and there. the changes i didn't like were they didn't explain who bill was, they didn't explain the mirror at all (if you read order of the Phoenix you know what it is) and they cut the phineus negilius scenes so the whoever sent the silver doe how were they suppose to know where they were if the charms and protection was around the camp site? other then that its spot on, the Malfoy manor scenes were so compelling and exciting. i loved how they did the horcrux locket scene with Ron destroying the horcrux. the best scene for me was when they were at Xenophilus Lovegoods house and Hermonie told the story of the 3 brothers (a very very cool sequence). and the ending was VERY sad and powerful and a good way to end part 1 making you want more. so overall a perfect adaptation to the first half (or so) of the book and i cannot wait for the final conclusion in the summer which I'm hoping is going to be better or equally as good. and many complained the camping scenes dragged in the book but they didn't really for me in the movie. i felt the movie went by fine and i couldn't really tell it was 2 plus hours. i cannot wait to see it again."

","I saw this movie yesterday, because my wife dragged me there. Yes, my expectations were not high to begin with, but I have been dragged to other movies before, including the first Harry Potter movie, so I thought I knew what to expect.<br/><br/>It was MUCH worse though. Obviously, this movie is nothing but an effort to milk as much money out of the Harry Potter franchise before the author finally runs out of ideas and the actors become too old.<br/><br/>What other reason could there be to make a 2.5hrs movie with absolutely no story whatsoever? I thought its based on a book with hundreds and hundreds of pages, or is there no story in that either? There is absolutely nothing happening in that movie, and if you haven't read the books you are pretty clueless about everything anyway. They keep teleporting around between the magical world and remote spots in the real world like mountain tops and woods. In fact a lot of the movie looks like three kids on a camping trip with Hermione reading books all the time and coming up with ""clues"" for their quests.<br/><br/>In the end they find a sword and destroy some locket that gives the wearer the blues. Big Whoop.<br/><br/>The last similar movie I was dragged to was the Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. I wasn't super fascinated about that either, but there was a story to follow, the fantasy world its set in was accessible, even if you hadn't read the book, there were things you could relate to and characters you could like.<br/><br/>There is nothing like that in this Harry Potter movie. No story. No character development.No movie. Just a waste of time."

","I used to love the Harry Potter movies more than most movies, and the reason to that is because they used to be magical, they felt like stories and fables. But the latest Harry Potter movies just down right suck. The reason to that is because they've lost all their magic, they've only reverted to CGI and seem to have put their focus there. The scenes look different from the other ones, the camera has a sickly annoying shake at most action scenes and the movie itself just hasn't got any intense moments at all. Plus after I saw it, I was expecting to somewhat understand the story, but apparently it didn't tell me squat. For example, I remember when they destroyed the necklace Horokrux which they'd got. After they had destroyed it, they said ""Good, now there are only four horokruxes left."" My damn question is, when he heck did they destroy the first three? One was tom riddles book and the other one was this necklace! Perhaps they did it in the Half Blood prince? If they did, them I must've missed it. But who can blame me? When the movie only was filled with over-dramatic scenes and an overdoing amount of CGI effects instead of story. So why blame me if I've missed it? But, let's get to a conclusion here. I didn't like the movie, nor do I recommend it to anyone who loved the first movies. I suggest you wait for Spielbergs animated series of harry potter."

This time the seventh. What is the point this time? I have no idea, the plot for every film is the same, the villain, Voldemort wants to kill Harry Potter, and yet, this simple plot line has been extended who knows how long.<br/><br/>What was at one time slightly amusing has become rather stale, tired and just plain boring.<br/><br/>This time around the three leads, Harry Potter, and his friends Ron and Hermoine are on the run looking for something called horcruxes which are supposed to kill off the evil Voldemort. (which is something that should have been done years ago) In any case, what probably works well on the page doesn't work so well on film. This episode called Deathly Hollows continues the same tired and stale storyline of the last several films with absolutely no pay off yet again.<br/><br/>I know that many will state I am being too hard on Harry Potter but I have never found these films to be as enjoyable as it's fan base.

","Ever since David Yates took over the directing of the Harry Potter series, the film has become uninteresting and surely very confusing as it misses the most crucial messages from the book. Of course, it is quite understandable that the film cannot be the exact copy of the book but at least, the screenplay writer, the producers and the director should have made it more clear what the messages in the fifth, sixth and the first episode of the seventh films were. For teenagers, these films can be fun, amazing, unexpectedly surprising but for the intellectual spectators, the last three films have been a disaster.<br/><br/>I have read and watched all of the books and films very closely, so far the first four series of the movie had a coherent, funny, mysterious and a MAGICAL character about them. I used the word ""magical"" because those four films had a touch of magic in the terms of editing, directing, message being passed on to the public and especially MUSIC. Yes, the harry potter music theme which was one of its biggest trade marks has suddenly disappeared and not only did it disappear, another composer with no magical, fun or mysterious taste has replaced it. But even if we leave alone the music, from the fifth film, it has been impossible to detect what, where, when, why, the events taking place actually took place and what they are leading to.<br/><br/>As a film critic, as a fan of the book and the film, I have been officially disappointed and I do not stand alone. Whole of Europe, that is the more demanding spectators across France, Belgium, Holland, Germany shall voice my disappointment as well.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the producers, the screenplay writer and the director, will find a solution to the growing deception in the film and turn their failure, in the second episode of the Deathly hallows, into a victory.<br/><br/>Hope never dies so I am, along with the other people sharing my opinion, hoping for at least an improvement of some kind."
"ajsb55","7","10","19","20 November 2010"," Disappointed
","I love everything about harry potter. All the movies and the books. Except for this movie. But that's okay because this movie wasn't really a Harry Potter movie. It just had the same actors and storyline.<br/><br/>There was no magical feeling in this movie. All the magic was GONE.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was okay. It would have been a great soundtrack if this movie wasn't part of a franchise, but as a Harry Potter movie it failed completely to incorporate the magic that John Williams so well added in his score. Also, this sounds too much like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (change it up a bit Alexandre Desplat). No inclusion of the Hedwig's theme, whats up with that!? Maybe they played it once at the beginning really lightly so you can't hear it since everyone's cheering when the movie's starting anyway.<br/><br/>The adaptation of the book was overall pretty good but I felt like it rushed through some things. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put in Harry's birthday scene, Kreacher's story, more from Rita Skeeter's book, and more from the Dursley's departure scene. Although somehow they did find the time to add some completely ridiculous and awkward scenes such as the dance between Harry and Hermione (which the entire theater was laughing at) and the kiss between Harry and Hermione (which the entire theater was screaming at). It felt like David Yates was trying to make the audience think that Harry and Hermione have a thing, when they Don't at all. Also, what happened to all the careful planning for the break in at the Ministry and Kreacher's home cooked meal that was waiting for them :(<br/><br/>Special effects were okay and the comedy bit was fine too. Cinematography was a little bit too overdone and the animation of Dobby was pretty bad. It didn't look bad it was just too different from the 2nd movie. I mean he looked fine in the 2nd movie, why change him??<br/><br/>Oh also, what was going on in that Deathly Hallows/3 brothers scene. That was just so inappropriate and totally not harry potterish.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed and it just wasn't a Harry Potter movie for me. I was excited to see how this movie could be nominated for some Academy Awards, but truthfully after seeing it I don't think they really deserve in the nomination. Maybe, cinematography if voters like the overdone excessive look or maybe one of those technical Oscars.<br/><br/>Second part should be better, hopefully. As long as David Yates doesn't suck the magic out of that one too.<br/><br/>(Just saw it again. Much better. I still mean what I said above but not as strongly)"
"TombRaider09","Null","6","10","8 December 2010"," The latest 'Potter' suffers from poor source material
","Although I would consider Rowling to be my favorite author, there is a tragic flaw in the last book of the Potter series, 'Deathly Hallows', which is even more apparent when adapted to film. I call it ""the treasure hunt jogging syndrome"", which can be fatal to any story and it is diagnosed mostly in adaptations, especially from fantasy books, even more so if the source material is a video game.<br/><br/>What is this syndrome? It occurs when the story of the film has characters who jog through the material from one place to another searching for certain items along the way. But the diagnosis does not end here, since in fact many action adventure movies, which are very good, follow the same formula, but distract the viewer with plot twists, relatable or extraordinary characters, funny dialog etc. so that the viewer's attention is not so explicitly focused on underlying structure.<br/><br/>But Harry Potter: Deathly Hallows Part 1 has very little of any of those distracting elements and the focus of any average viewer will be focused on its structure, and it is not the film-makers' fault. In fact, only Rowling can be blamed for this. The entire reason to read the book is to finally uncover all the mysteries that the author has systematically introduced from ever since the first novel. Since those answers are certainly captivating, the reader remains unaware that the entire book is essentially a long jog where the characters go from one place to another searching for things that need to be destroyed.<br/><br/>But after a few years since one has read the novel and sees the story on screen, it reveals the ugly truth: nothing much else is worth seeing here except the big reveal about a certain horcrux. All that precedes it is an exhausting jog from one place to another where all the scenes could be rearranged in any way one pleases without any effects on the story. <br/><br/>The one-liners and occasional character moments spike things up, but do not have the gravitational force to pull the viewer from surprised boredom, which a fan of Potter certainly does not expect to experience from a Harry Potter adventure."

","As the book is at some parts too long, so is the film. No ... wrong, the film is about one a half our too long: due to the fact, that the film presents no excitement. As soon as there is at least a bit of action, it is already over and the viewer can go back to see the tent at different locations ... The 7th book presented so many options to make a great movie out of it, but David Yates failed totally. But I do think it isn't his fault or the fault of the actors (they did a good job, given the bad script) - it is only credited to the fact, that JKR had too much control over everything. I think the second part will be a bit better, but only because of all the action and fighting and I think a lot of people only want to see the glimpse of the future of the main characters."
"Robert_duder","5","5","8","20 February 2011"," Sadly the poorest in the series. Proof they dragged this into two parts to make cash
","I love the Harry Potter films. I have never read the books and probably never will. The films have been breathtaking, brilliant, beautiful, with one of the greatest ensemble casts I have ever seen. They didn't just play their roles but single handedly embodied them. So I was excited and sad to see this second last instalment of the last great fantasy epic. How disheartening to discover that this was nothing more than a forced first part to the two part finale to squeeze more money out of the franchise. 95% of all the characters that made this series incredible are gone. The action, special effects, and brilliant fantasy is practically nil. I read several reviews on IMDb and some loved it and many hated it and the ones who hated it said the same things I thought about it. The starring cast spend the entire film 'warping' out of trouble and into forest. ""Harry Potter goes camping"" as one reviewer called it. The amazing supporting cast from previous instalments get virtually no time on screen and the entire 2 1/2 hour film could have been summarized into a half hour before the final film. I can barely summarize how disappointed I was in how they created this filler film.<br/><br/>The three original stars return and are fortunately as good as ever. The thing that holds this sub-par entry together is bringing back our favourite characters. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are in full form. The best part of the film is the continuing and growing relationship between Grint and Watson's Ron and Hermione. The rest of the cast are as good as they have ever been. The cast is not, and never has been the issue as I still stand by previous statements by me that this is the finest cast in a film series ever. They truly breath life into this series. Unfortunately the supporting cast shows up for barely minutes. The amazing Robbie Coltrane has less than five minutes as Hagrid, in what could have an A+ addition to the cast, the amazing Bill Nighy spends five minutes on screen as the Minister, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and even the amazing big bad Ralph Fiennes is so sadly underused. The Harry Potter franchise has always been as much about Hogwart's School and the teachers as any other part of it and for Deathly Hallows every aspect of that is gone and instead you are left with teleportation to the same forest again and again.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if its a coincidence that the series has been on a bit of decline since director David Yates took the helm. It could also be pointed out that by the time you hit the fifth instalment of the series its hard to keep things fresh but I feel like its more than that when it comes to Harry Potter. Two major plot points happen in this film with the death of two characters and it happens so quickly and with such little fanfare that it feels unemotional. Honestly, I think you could literally skip right over this instalment and miss out on nothing. Its really hard for me to write a review like this because I do love this series and I want to re-iterate this cast is amazing as always which is why I'm scoring this a 6 as opposed to a 2 or 3 which is what the story is worth which is downright side when the entire series thus far has been made up of films worth 8-10/10 easy. This one was a stumble and let's hope they can finish the series worthy of what it is!! 6/10"

","But unfortunately, that also means that we are, sadly, reaching the end of a great series. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the bullseye of what's going to go down between good and evil in the wizarding world.<br/><br/>Things are getting worse in the world of witches and wizards, thanks to Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, including the now-hesitant Malfoys and the borderline insane Bellatrix Lestrange. Voldy wants Harry Potter and wants to kill him personally, and if you've seen and read Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, then you'll know why. The movie is a large, 2 1/2 hour cat-and-mouse game as Harry and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, travel around the country, searching for Voldemort's treasured Horcruxes (his weights for immortality) and destroy them for good, leading Harry closer and closer to taking down Voldemort as a mortal man.<br/><br/>The movie is like the flesh and blood of the book. The actors have portrayed nearly every bits of the book very well. You see the proof clearly that Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't at Hogwarts anymore. They don't know who to trust and what's safe anymore.<br/><br/>The only minor flaws are that (MINOR SPOILER, but I will be light with it) there are scenes they place such as Harry's visions of Voldemort at his angriest that don't seem to be clear for those who haven't read the book. You only receive a few spats from Voldemort and his livid face before Harry wakes up. The other minor flaw is that they didn't fully explain R.A.B., which I won't go into detail for the sake of keeping the secret of the movie.<br/><br/>Besides these two little mistakes, the movie is amazing to watch, and if you're a fan of the book, then 2 1/2 hours will go back as quickly as it did for me. You'll feel horror, sorrow, and even anger as you watch Harry and his friends cast the ultimate spell."

","Coming from a person who has not read the books I really enjoyed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and cannot wait for part 2. The previous film while it had its flaws was able to continue progressing the film at a steady pace. I only wished that the last film had more of a climax and since this one has split up one book into two films, I was fearing that this would leave me disappointed but it didn't!<br/><br/>This film is clearly no longer made for children and the story has reached that point where newcomers will be completely lost and will need to start at the beginning in order to catch up. I know this sounds similar to last three films but this one is different. I think it is safe to say that this requires the viewer to be able to remember what Harry, Ron and Hermione have been through otherwise you will find it difficult to connect with characters. <br/><br/>The reason for this is that it is more of an art film than a traditional blockbuster action film, which is great because of how it is not afraid to step outside of the box. There are scenes which had me wondering how much further the filmmakers could go before the age rating would have to go up. The overall effect of this makes the film a refreshing experience and it is good to see that the film is aiming specifically at fans and no longer concentrates on trying to attract new audiences.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film does include several breathtaking action sequences that will keep you in suspense, such as a furious chase through a forest and a fight scene in a house, which I will not spoil for you. However the action in this film is not as frequent as it once was in previous films of the series, therefore expect lots of scenes involving talking but this is not a bad thing, which leads me onto the characters.<br/><br/>Since I have not read the book, scenes that were taken out providing extra background details did not bother me but for those who have, might feel bothered by this since it has been split into two films. With a running time of over 2 hours (it felt less) and less time spent on action, the film is able to concentrate on its characters. The acting is great and while some characters get more screen time than others, everyone performs to their strengths. <br/><br/>What earned the last film an Oscar nomination was its cinematography and it continues to amaze here. Setting the atmosphere perfectly for each scene, it is clear that the Harry Potter series would not be the same without it. The direction is also brilliant, bringing something new to the Harry Potter series each time.<br/><br/>Darker in atmosphere, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 should not be missed. The slight change in tone will not be for everyone but it does allow for the actors to shine and for the story to be given the credit it deserves. While it may not cover everything from the book, its long running time makes for a satisfying viewing experience leaving you eager for Part 2."
"zereshk","8","5","8","26 November 2010"," Slow pacing allows for more depth
","This film is a nice break from the hectic pacing of the last ones. Ever since the third film, when 2 1/2 hours became much too short for an adequate adaptation of the books, the movies have been rather loveless attempts to squeeze just enough information into the limited time to allow for a superficial understanding of the main story lines. This one, on the other hand, takes its times, which is its greatest strength, and stays rather close to the book. On multiple occasions I was really surprised when another detail that wasn't strictly necessary to the main plot was graciously allowed its space.<br/><br/>This is a very good adaptation that makes me wish they had started making two-part movies out of the books earlier. And since it already covers about 3/4 of the book, I am looking forward to a similarly (or even more?) detailed second part."
"Aussie255","9","8","15","18 November 2010"," Perfectly captures the essence of the book, yet transcends above it through its cinematic flair
","There may be some slight spoilers ahead<br/><br/>Even though most may come away from the film feeling almost inevitably let down, due to the fact that it is essentially half of a film, to me this film is the most accurate recreation of the novel out of them all and finally manages to preserve the soul of JK Rowling's writing, yet still allowing for an artistic flair, through the innovative sequences such as the unique animation of the Tales of Beedle the Bard, and the consistently stunning cinematography.<br/><br/>The acting by the trio is finally perfect and more importantly consistent, as they truly embody their individual characters and really become Harry, Ron and Hermione. Emma and Rupert are the clear standouts, Emma's torture scene and opening scene at her parents are truly chilling, whilst Rupert's angry outburst and departure, as well as his speech about the light on his return were both brilliantly acted. <br/><br/>The action sequences are also stunning and perfectly recreate the scenes from the books exactly as I imagined. The Seven Potters, while shorter than I would have liked, had the awe-inspiring shot of the Death Eaters attacking the seven pairs in the clouds, making up for the slightly missed opportunity to show what happened to the individual pairs rather than just following Harry as it was in the book. The Ministry scene was equally as impressive and well done, perfectly representing the book whilst becoming something more.<br/><br/>The attention to detail throughout the film is really superb and unlike Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets, the inclusion of practically all scenes from the books never feels like a straightforward word by word recreation with no soul, as the many artistic changes to the story and the brilliant cinematography, beautiful score and pitch-perfect acting, allow this film to transcend above the other Potter's whilst still remaining true to the source. <br/><br/>9/10 from me"
"mistoppi","3","3","4","23 October 2016"," These are getting worse
","The ending is closer and the movies are worse. Still they are trying to make an action film out of Harry Potter, but what's worse is how the filmmakers clearly don't know what to cut. There is such a long time of... nothing. They do nothing. There's some dialogue but it's not always entirely insightful. And there's the weird dance scene and all that. Yes, those scenes how Harry, Ron and Hermione were on the run for a really long time, but that's really frustrating for the audience. How about you cut that and make this film shorter - or better yet - include some things that were in the books but were barely mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>I also don't like the point where they cut the movie in two. I've checked so many times what is the half point of the book, and I think they should've cut the movie around there - where that chapter ends at least. But I guess they wanted to stuff the Deathly Hallows into this movie. <br/><br/>Best part of the whole movie is the Tale of the three brothers. It's visually more stunning than anything we've seen in Harry Potter movies. It's so awesome it seems completely out of place in this movie. It's still of course an interesting piece of lore, and a nice way to take a break from the events in the movie. <br/><br/>Everything went downhill after Prisoner of Azkaban. I've been wondering why I don't like Harry Potter so much anymore, but this seems to be the reason. None of the later movies were good."

","""These are daaaaaark times-uh"", Bill Nighy Christopher Walkens in his terse opening monologue, and there's no denying that. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows heralded many things: the finale to a cinematic franchise generations had grown up alongside, the rip-roaring, no-holds-barred finale of a world of magic plunged into chaos. But, more than all that, it was a grim harbinger for things to come. Yes, this was the first mega-franchise entry to bear the suffix ""Part I"", issuing in a dawn of unforgivably segmented final instalment money grabs from Twilight, The Hunger Games, and, **shudder** The Hobbit. Yes, The Deathly Hallows truly was the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>Okay - so splitting Rowling's 759 page epic had its advantages. Rather than the usual frenzied rush and jettisoning of subplots causing fans to howl worse than Fenrir Greyback, here, returning director David Yates could take his time, allow his film to breathe, and tease out the full drama and poignancy in events rather than blitzing past them. <br/><br/>¬Öat least that must have been how he pitched the film to Warner Bros. The polite truth is, Deathly Hallows Part I is a bit of a grim, dull, visually murky thankless mess, with only occasional sparks of the Potter magic we know and love. Mostly, it's fated to be remembered as ""the one people mostly fast-forward through in Harry Potter-a-thons"".<br/><br/>Yates' third time in the Headmaster's seat, having conjured entries both stellar (Part V) and sour (Part VI), ultimately illustrates his greatest strengths and weaknesses as a franchise director. He's inspired at allowing small, intimate emotional moments to resonate, drawing power and poignancy from understated beats like Harry bidding farewell to his old cupboard under the stairs at Privet Drive or wandering through the room of his deceased godfather. He's also prone to balancing his propensity for solemn melodrama with bursts of the daftest humour at the least likely of times (here, fun with Polyjuice potion sees Daniel Radcliffe struggling in a bra, and *literal* toilet humour). And he can throw down with a hell of a action sequence, as his cracking wizard duels evidence, particularly an opening aerial battle against the forces of Voldemort - too short, but still liable to leave viewers gasping for breath. His Potters, love or hate them, are by far the most fundamentally cinematic of the bunch.<br/><br/>But, with the good comes a heck of a lot of bad here. Amidst ruthlessly paring down Rowling's words to a palatable cinematic length, Yates has a worrisome propensity to forget to direct his background actors, making too many of Rowling's plentiful ""_____'s dead!"" announcements in ensemble scenes land with almost comically unresponsive thuds, and the frequency of flat (or should I say Stupefied) acting stripping the majority of the narrative of any real sense of urgency. But even more inexcusable is the film's thunderously clumsy editing, lumbering from plot point to plot point stitched together with dolefully lazy exposition like a full-body- bound troll, rushing through or outright excluding key moments (no Lupin confrontation? No Dursleys farewell? Meanwhile, the perfectly cast Bill Nighy is criminally wasted as Minister Scrimgeour by stripping all political tension from his cameo), while lingering exhaustively on the more stagnant moments of Rowling's text. Composer Alexandre Desplat's score is virtually nonexistent, with most scenes, regardless of the emotion, playing out in cumbersomely uncomfortable silence. And let us not forget our tour of stately British countrysides, hosted by The Lord of the Locket exacerbating the worst surly hormones our leads have to offer (and Yates sneaking in a brewing love triangle is enough to make even the most Muggle of viewers feel sick). If Yates' objective was to convey the soul-rotting boredom, frustration, and despair flecking the first half of Rowling's final novel, he outdoes himself, though it's dubious how much is intentional.<br/><br/>Still: magic is might, and the few moments the film comes alive do wonders. An expedition into the Ministry of Magic is rife with tension and political snark (including a welcome return of Imelda Staunton's sublimely loathsome Umbridge) and a jaunt to Godric's Hollow yields pristine Gothic horror, while the shadow puppet interlude detailing the legend of the Deathly Hallows is visually dazzling fun. Upping the FX ante helps bring house elves Dobby and Kreacher to life in a far less eerie fashion (essential, as Dobby's climactic death is the film's only real emotional sucker punch), while Yates certainly isn't afraid to push the darkness to the next level. Both Ralph Fiennes's preening Voldemort and Helena Bonham Carter's delightfully demented Bellatrix get grisly torture scenes, while Emma Watson nearly steals the show, fighting back tears as she erases her parents memories. Didn't expect that when Robbie Coltrane first croaked ""Yer a wizard, 'Arry"", didja?<br/><br/>Radcliffe, while intrinsically lovable, plays Harry as too bruised and stunned to connect much to here, leaving most of the emotional heavy lifting to Watson and Rupert Grint, who hugely comes into his own here with his most impressively mature, deft performance to date beyond his customary irrepressible goofy humour. The usual supporting players delight with their fleeting bits - Brendan Gleeson's bombastic Mad-Eye Moody is hysterically grumpy as always, and the glorious James & Oliver Phelps and Evanna Lynch bring as many laughs as ever as Fred, George, and Luna, even if Rhys Ifans is nowhere near weird enough to make a mark as Xenophilius Lovegood.<br/><br/>Even with such a dour, unrewarding plot so scant on moments of infectious, joyful magic, Deathly Hallows I still brings the inescapable charm of a Potter film, though its carelessness with pacing and editing strand it at the bottom of the cauldron. If anything, double-billing parts VII and VIII does set up the final outing as the triumphant blowout it should be, though it wouldn't take much to raise the spirits from the mucky affair that is its predecessor.<br/><br/>-6/10"
"OllieSuave-007","4","3","4","15 July 2014"," The Boring Hallows.
","The film adaptation of the final Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is split into two parts, with this movie being Part I. We see Harry, Ron and Hermoine scramble to find the rest of the Horcruxes to get a shot at defeating Voldemort, whose powers have since grown and who has taken over the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie consisted of a bunch of wizards helping Harry escape Hogwarts, away from the Deatheaters, which results in some magical action and sophisticated visual effects. Afterward, much of the rest of the movie falls flat; while there is a large cast of characters in the movie, Harry, Ron, and Hermione consume most of the picture, resulting in mostly them sitting in the mountains away from Hogwarts struggling with their angst and anger over and over about their friendship and their uncertainty levels of surviving the Voldermort assaults. This coupled with the lack of magic, action and suspenseful adventures rendered the movie totally boring.<br/><br/>The so-called love/romantic scenes involving Harry and Hermoine and a wedding scene sways away from the film and served no real purpose. The scenes with the Weasley Family attempting to fend off some Deatheaters were pretty exciting, but those were one of but a very few action scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, while you do see the deep emotional impact the events from the previous film had left on the wizards, what you get in this film is few action and just lots of talk, preaching and uninteresting drama. It would have been better if the filmmakers had fitted the entire novel into one film instead of two.<br/><br/>Grade D"
"anton2101","4","3","4","30 January 2014"," A huge disappointment.
","Recently I have been watching the entire series for the first time and I have to say I enjoyed all the previous films. The 6th one though left a strange feeling that Rowling was running out of ideas and much of the good stuff was substituted with typical romance. I hoped something was stored for the final story but nope, a big disappointment here. The film feels like a really bad soap opera you are wishing to finally end but can't turn off because you are too much invested into the story. There is almost nothing to keep you entertained, the dialogues are especially lacking and there are lots of them. At the end I even started losing my sympathies towards the three heroes watching them running away from a mere gang of bandits (all of whom got disarmed by a single witch later) and even failing to do that. I mean come on, you are going to kill the almighty Voldemort and can't even stand up against those? And the elf being killed was the final nail in the film's coffin, so predictable and so cheap.<br/><br/>If you value your time, just read the plot on the internet and move on."
"stefaneinar","5","3","4","5 June 2011"," Not very effective
","I personally think that this movie was pretty boring. 10% of the movie was actually fighting Voldemort, and the 90% was basically just a camping trip. It was wasn't very exciting. The only effective scene in this was when Dobby died. I think they should have cancel having the last 2 movies in 2 parts. And make just 1 movie which is actually exciting. The movie has pretty good acting and fun moments, but there is no chance that I would even consider watching it again, or even downloading it. I was very disappointed after and couldn't believe that I actually wasted money to see this rubbish. There was nothing interesting in this movie. I give this movie a 5 out of 10. Btw. Emma Watson is hot."
"harconn21","2","3","4","14 May 2011"," Holy Crap!
","I'm a big HP fan; I have the books and I've seen all the movies, but I think this one was the worst of the lot so far. It's one thing to make a movie out of a book, but when you have Rowling material, don't chop it up! The first two movies were good, but beginning with the third, it's like the filmmakers just weren't into it; things began going down drain from there, and each installment kept getting a little bit worse.<br/><br/>With DH P1 in particular, I found that no matter how loud I put my TV, it was often hard to hear the dialogue and most of the time, the music was too loud. Words were mumbled and certain lines just came out sounding wrong.<br/><br/>I cringed when it came to the Ministry scenes: I mean really, you'd think the way Harry's Runcorn was moving, he was dead, he was so stiff! What was David O'Hara thinking? Another thing that's annoyed me about movies three through seven is that the right dialogue is said, but the setting is wrong. They did that a bit in the first two, but it wasn't as noticeable.<br/><br/>Things in DH P1 jumped around a lot, it was really choppy and there was very little transitional flow. For those of us who haven't read the last book in awhile, it was quite disconcerting. And really, I think only Radcliffe, Watson and Grint should have gotten star billing on Wikipedia, because Snape's scene(s) in the final cut amounted to little more than a cameo, and yet Alan Rickman got star billing.<br/><br/>Overall, comparing all the movies so far, this one was the worst. When HBP came out, I almost didn't want to watch it because I was afraid of the horrors I would see. The only reason I did was because Rowling is such a great writer.<br/><br/>I don't know what to expect for P2 but I'm thinking it could almost be as bad as P1; they were shot at the same time after all. There really wasn't anything good about P1. I actually considered turning it off. I was really, really disappointed. I could't believe that such a good production team could pull off such horrible work. Hell, I've seen kid's stuff that was better! It really was a let down.<br/><br/>I don't usually like to give material of Rowling's caliber such a low ranking (2) but unfortunately, Deathly Hallows deserved it. Maybe it's because I'm a writer that I'm picky about this sort of material. We'll see what P2 is like. Cheers!"
"stanzerlsepherl","4","3","4","6 February 2011"," some nice highlights, but overall disappointing
","Looking back on the whole HP series, I must confess, that each and every time I had left the cinema disappointed. And it wasn't different this time.<br/><br/>However, this installment was quite different from the previous movies. I loved the scenery and the visuals in general. For the first time, I was actually scared in one scene: Nagini simply is an amazing digital creature (and has almost become my favourite ""HP-movie-character"" by now). --(I am not going to repeat, what many before me have already written about the individual scenes etc etc)--<br/><br/>Overall, the director fails to convince me with his interpretation of the magical world. It isn't a whole, thought-through global fantasy in which the audience is invited in the first scene and then continuously drawn in further along with the developing characters. And thus, it isn't surprising that emotions and tension aren't carried over to the audience. Sometimes, I would have wished for more ""meaning"" in the all the background scenery: If it is difficult to translate fantasy to the screen, why put the focus of the film on three young actors that are never able to capture in their dialogue the general desolation and danger in which the whole world is in and not just them: I could have imagined flying-camera over villages where the death-eaters or werewolves have clearly left their bloody trail: some global context !? Same goes for the side-characters: why cast a good fraction of Britain's finest actors, if you don't use them? Apart from Fiennes, who never managed to frighten/intimidate me as Voldemort, the actors Rickman & Co could have improved the depth and coherence much, had they not been treated as ""occasional accessories"".<br/><br/>Concluding, I found it an unsatisfying movie where the many ingredients add up to less than their sum. Individual performances are mostly good, there are some very nice scenes, but the overall screenplay and directing seems immature, sometimes even amateurish."
"CagedinSanity","4","3","4","28 January 2011"," What a shame.
","It's a shame because almost every movie gets between a 7-8 out of 10 for me (Half-Blood Prince gets a 6.5 because, well, it had little to do with the Half-Blood Prince. Snape had a much bigger role in the book) for it's general accuracy and decent action that was paced well with the general school-time shenanigans. <br/><br/>TDH:Part 1 falls on it's face with this. NOTHING HAPPENS. It's two hours of... very little. They could have taken 20 minutes from this movie and just tack it onto Part 2 and call it one movie.<br/><br/>I've always been opposed to this whole idea of ""splitting"" the movies, but I at least understood why. Even the book was just one big scavenger hunt. Why devote two extra hours to this nonsense? Well, if they had just automatically found every Magical McGuffin, people would complain about it being too easy. But as it is, we're complaining because it was boring.<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not a director. But from 6 previously decent movies, the director could have done this better.<br/><br/>Here's the general outline of this movie; Intro. Fight scene. Wedding. Fight scene. Escape. Camping. More camping. A fight scene. A chase scene! More camping. Dark Lord gains major magical McGuffin. Movie ends.<br/><br/>Oddly, my favorite scenes weren't the fighting or the camping. I'm a sucker for character development and it was sparse, but present. For example; Harry going to his birth-town. That was a strangely fascinating scene, even in its simplicity. <br/><br/>So, very clever. People are still required to sit through this crap in order to be caught up with part 2. Although, someone can just read reviews and summaries and miss very little. So you have that option."
"TFrauline","5","3","4","20 January 2011"," Does its job as part 1, but a horrible movie.
","This film accomplishes its goal of setting the stage for the final Potter movie in part 2, but unfortunately this is all it really does. Even when viewed with the emotional history of the previous films/books in mind, and also with the knowledge its only part 1, this is still a bad movie.<br/><br/>The pacing is absolutely terrible. They used 2+ hours to explain basic plot points concerning a single horocrux, the sword, and the origin of the hallows. This is done through an annoyingly repetitive and linear plot structure of Harry finding one thing, to go and find another, to go and find another, to go and find one last thing. Then voldemort finds his own thing and the movie ends.<br/><br/>The plot is filled with coincidences and conveniences. Ron and Dobby randomly appear when they're most needed, and it just generally feels like they tried to take a chunk of the plot from the book and spread it too thin to cover more time. I feel like all the major/minor plot points and character development could have been dealt with effectively in 1 hour.<br/><br/>My final issue with the film is the appalling ending. The last confrontation felt really contrived and lacked buildup, significance, or action. The death of such a minor character as Dobby is really not the way I would end the film. Even with his history in mind, it felt like he just popped up to save the day then died for the sake of trying to tug a few heartstrings. There was a total lack of emotional investment in his death and I didn't feel any sense of immersion in the film when it occurred. In addition, even with Voldemort finding the wand it didn't feel like stuff was about to happen at the end which is what you want from a part 1. They could have literally ended the film at any point during the plot and it would have carried about the same sense of anticipation.<br/><br/>Please keep in mind that I am not considering how accurate it was to the book as a positive or negative thing. This is supposed to be a MOVIE and should therefore be reviewed as a cinematic experience, not just its relationship to the book.<br/><br/>Despite the brutal plot structure and weak ending, there is no way I can rate this movie less than 5 because it did do many things well. The opening scene of flight to the Weasley's left me breathless and was some of the best action I've seen in the entire series. The acting was uniformly excellent as we've come to expect from the gang. Despite the poor settings (forests for everyone!) the movie did manage to impart a general atmosphere of grim hopelessness and I'd say it's the darkest of the series so far. Finally, I thought the animated scene about the hallows was utterly mesmerizing and the best part of the last 30 minutes.<br/><br/>My advice, don't see this in theatres, don't even see it when it comes out on DVD. Wait until part 2 hits theatres and then watch it before you go see that. Because the only way this could ever be a passable movie is when its attached to part 2."
"aleusong","6","3","4","24 November 2010"," An uninspiring step towards the finale
","After watching the horridness of Half-Blood Prince, I was gonna keep my hopes low for this film. However some people on here who hated Half-Blood Prince loved Deathly Hallows pt 1.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I am not a part of this camp. I was part of the group who believed that Deathly Hallows pt1 was an improvement over Half Blood Prince but not at all by much. Everything in this film was done almost in the same fashion that Half Blood Prince was done. The only reason why this film would be considered better is because the book itself had more action and plot development. It didn't had to waste it's time inventing stuff or stretching scenes because their was plenty to work with here: *SPOILERS* The good is that so far all the important scenes have been put into the movie (except one in my mind).<br/><br/>The bad is divided into two sections: what's missing and what replaced it.<br/><br/>First off, the Dursleys cameo was disappointing. What's the point in bringing them back for the film if we cant get as much as a line from Dudley saying goodbye to Harry? Second...too much Hermoine! Okay so I know Ron was gone for part of the story but there's so much focus on Hermoine than is really necessary.<br/><br/>Third...my biggest peeve...too many gags. God I swear every five seconds Steve Kloves is trying to write something stupid into this script to get a giggle out of the audience. I don't recall the gags being half this annoying in the days of Chris Columbus. It's the last freakin book. Get a little more serious here! Worse yet, a moment where a character was supposed to have died is replaced with a comical blackout instead. Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!!!! Among other things, I didn't like the animation of the Three Brothers segment plus other details here and there. Also the broken mirror piece is brought into this movie with absolutely no explanation. If someone who only sees the films (like my friend) still has to ask me questions then you got yourself a problem as far as writing is concerned. In fact the mood of the film from start to finished played like a bad Twilight movie which is in itself very disgraceful...especially when it is the last book of the series. I don't mind if they want to go dark but this is the last book of the series and to me, it lacks anything purely epic in scope. Therefore I'm keeping my hopes low for a spectacular finale."
"ridiculonius","10","4","6","21 December 2010"," FINALLY! Yates gets it!
","Having been a huge Harry Potter fan for the past 10 years (I finished the 2nd book just before the 1st film came out), my relationship with the films has been rather rocky. The first two, I thought, captured the whimsical essence of the first two books. The third managed to make itself the director's own without taking away from the original novel. From ""Goblet of Fire"" on, however, the HP films began to go downhill. And once David Yates signed on, I began to lose faith in the art of adaptations.<br/><br/>The 5th, 6th, and 7th Harry Potter books are my top 3 favourites in the series (not in that order, mind you), and after the butchered story & characters that made up ""Order of the Phoenix"", I wanted to die. Yates had taken the book and made it his own, all right... but not in a good way. He turned ""OotP"" into a self-indulgent montage of Harry's angst. He cut all the important back-story and information in ""Half-Blood Prince"", and turned it into a romantic comedy with magic. The man simply didn't understand that, in order to make an adaption good, one must first and foremost please the FANS.<br/><br/>But, hallelujah, with ""Deathly Hallows"", the man finally got it! Capturing the grit and dark tone of the novel without focusing on the angst as he did in Movie 5, Yates' latest film has managed to stay (thankfully) close to the book. Obviously, some things were cut - but considering that most of the novel's first half consists of strategies, flashbacks, and repetitive hiding out, this really isn't an issue. And taking into consideration how much Yates had to throw in last-minute due to their absence in the other films (Mundungus Fletcher, Bill & Fleur's relationship and wedding, additional Horcrux information, etc.), the 2-and-a-half hours they had were put to extremely good use.<br/><br/>My beefs were petty, few, and far between. First among them is the already infamous dancing scene between Harry and Hermione. It irritated me at the same time that it entertained me, only because it was pointless and only served to give pathetic hope to a ship that will never sail (seriously, all the directors seem to be Harry/Hermione shippers). My second irritation actually has a name - and that name is Bonnie Wright. Ginny never quite did it for me in the books, but at least she had a personality; Wright plays the snarky spark-plug like so much dead wood. As a result, we care just as much about her (and her relationship with Harry) as we would any random extra. Luckily, she doesn't have that much screen time in Part 1.<br/><br/>All technical things aside, when you get right down to it, I'm just relieved. Relieved that David Yates finally gets it - with something as widely-loved as the Harry Potter franchise, one cannot screw around. The director of an adaption has an obligation to the fans of the original work - and Yates has FINALLY acknowledged that obligation in ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". If you're a fan of the books, or even if you're not, you'll love it!"
"matchbox51","6","4","6","16 December 2010"," True Harry Potter fans will be let down after watching Deathly Hallows Part 1
","I am thoroughly disappointed after seeing this installment of the movie. After reading every book multiple times and seeing them portrayed on the big screen I've been fairly happy with the way the directors/producers have instilled the quality of J.K's writing style.<br/><br/>However, after seeing the 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' I am very disappointed the way they left out such large amounts of information and action that was included in the books. The earlier movies did a good job holding their parts of the book series, but the Deathly Hallows seems to have been slashed into bits and pieces and has not meant my standards whatsoever when it comes to including the magic of the writing from the book itself.<br/><br/>There are many parts of the book that were missing in just this first half of the last installment of the movies; the second part I'm afraid is going to end up being just the same way.<br/><br/>There was plenty of good graphics and the sequencing was decent, but as I said there was just too much missing for me to enjoy the movie. Parts were ruined by rushing through details that would ultimately help explain the story line/plot much better - some parts were just skipped completely.<br/><br/>Now I understand that the books are very long and are hard to portray into a movie, and there is an acceptable amount of loss of quality from paper to the big screen, but that fine line was crossed (at least in my eyes) and completely ruined this movie for me.<br/><br/>I still would suggest watching the movie. For those of you who haven't read the books, you will enjoy the movie much more than I did, but even those who haven't read the books will notice there is something missing from the plot.<br/><br/>I will be waiting for part 2 to make a final decision on the last installment of the movie series, but as of right now I stand disappointed.<br/><br/>I rated the movie a 6 out of 10 since the story was still there (but lax) and the characters were played out decently (but had much room to grow). I would have given this movie a much higher rating if it were to have grabbed my attention more often rather than skim over such large parts of the book - even those small things, which make the books so good, were missing. Without the smaller segments included in the movie it just feels like something much different from the book, and for those of us who truly are looking for a great portrayal of the book on the big screen this just wasn't enough."
"shreeshabhat","5","4","6","1 December 2010"," The greatest best-sellers in history deserved better movies!
","We are now just one movie (or half a book) away from the end of this franchise, and looking back at the entire series, I would say that apart from the first movie, Harry Potter has been a big mess on screen. The first movie was truly magical and the second was passable, but after that it has been a sore disappointment for most of the die-hard HP fans like me. The movies do not even come close to creating on screen the magic what J.K.Rowling has created on paper.<br/><br/>The theme of these movies, especially part 4 onwards, has been to delete the best-described action sequences from the story. You could feel the adrenaline rush when you read the description of the Quidditch World Cup final, but where did it go in the movie? In part 5 they reduced Umbridge from an evil, devil-incarnate to a caricature merely providing comic relief, and the battle at the ministry was over before it began. Part 6 covered Dumbledore's 'classes' well but again, the students versus Death Eaters duels were cut out. All these are unpardonable crimes committed on the books, the author and more importantly, on the fans. <br/><br/>Despite all this, I was excitedly looking forward to Deathly Hallows Part 1, because having divided the book into two parts, there was immense opportunity to transfer all the excitement of the book on to the screen, but the end result while being marginally better than the previous few movies, was still disappointing.<br/><br/>Most of the movie was turned into an advertisement for British tourism, as we were shown endless vistas of the landscape as the trio wander across forests, hills and swamps. In the book, the period where Harry stays with the Weasleys is charged with emotion and could have been a true test of the director's abilities, but it barely lasted five minutes (including the wedding!). When Ron returns to rejoin the other two, Hermione looks mildly irritated, and not demented with rage as in the book. <br/><br/>The Godric's Hollow sequence began well, but once Bathilda turned into a snake and attacked Harry, the action was cut out again, and there was no Voldemort appearing here! The ending was a sore disappointment as usual, because here was another opportunity for some more dueling and displays of bravery, but we hardly had half a dozen curses being cast. The Life and Lies of Dumbledore was just mentioned in passing. <br/><br/>What gives the movie a 5/10 instead of a 1 or a 2 is the Tale of Three Brothers animated sequence, the break-in at the ministry, the graveyard scene at Godric's Hollow and marginally improved performances by the trio. I feel the best-selling book series in history deserved the best directors in Hollywood. Peter Jackson could have worked his LOTR magic here. Christopher Nolan could have best recreated the much-talked about ""dark, gloomy pallor"" of the last three books. Even somebody who loves loud wham-bam action and overdoses of CGI, like Roland Emmerich of 2012, could have given us some breathtaking action sequences. But all we had was David Yates and I dunno who else. All of them effectively ruined a series of books which will be read and loved and worshipped for generations to come. I can only hope the franchise at least gets a finale it deserves. We will be finding out in July."
"MovieManMenzel","8","4","6","23 November 2010"," David Yates finally ""gets"" Harry Potter in the beginning of the final chapter.
","I don't know how other film lovers and Harry Potter fans feel but I for one have had mixed experiences with these films. The first two films were good, the third and fourth were the best in the series, the fifth was a disaster, and the sixth was OK. The beloved wizard named ""Harry Potter"" has definitely had a bumpy road in his transition from novel to screen in my opinion. With that being said, the end is near folks and part one of the final chapter of ""Harry Potter"" has arrived in theaters. That's right for those of you living under a rock, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" is in theaters now. I was a bit leery seeing the film after how disappointed I have been since David Yates took over the franchise but like any dedicated fan boy, I walked into the theater hoping for the best.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" is the beginning of the end of one of the most popular and beloved book/film franchises in history. In the seventh entry in the film series, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) along with his two best friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Rupert Grint have to fight time and evil as they discover that the three of them have to track down and destroy the missing Horcruxes. Along the way, the three friends learn about the dark secrets of Dumbledore as well as the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world known as the Deathly Hallows. Suspense ensues..<br/><br/>As I said above, I am a pretty loyal fan to the franchise as I have seen all the films and read the books. I enjoyed the film franchise a lot until David Yates took over as director. When I attended the midnight showing of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" I was extremely disappointed. I knew going into the film that they left the franchise in the hands of an amateur filmmaker and the end result was not a good experience at all. When I saw the sixth film, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was being made my Yates, I actually cringed. I had a slightly better experience with the sixth film although I still felt Yates really didn't really give the book much justice. The whole ending of the film was just terrible and wasn't even remotely dramatic. Yates destroyed a huge moment in the ""Harry Potter"" legacy with that ending.<br/><br/>Now moving on to the seventh film, David Yates actually made ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" into one one the best films in the franchise. Let me tell you that I was shocked to come out of the film saying wow this is a great entry in the franchise but it truly was. Yates must have really studied the last book when he made the film. Yates added some stuff to the film that was not in the book and was unnecessary but as a whole the film was very loyal to the book. Yates finally captured the magic that is ""Harry Potter."" I guess the old saying, third times the charm, applies to this film.<br/><br/>Yates direction was perfectly timed and placed, unlike the previous two entry the film didn't suffer from any real boring spots. This one was shot much better and the pace was on the ball. Yates captured the actors and actually made them seem mature and realistic without coming off as forced. In the previous entries, I remember laughing at Harry when he started yelling but in this film he was more convincing and that's due to the better direction by Yates.<br/><br/>At this point, I think its unnecessary to comment on the acting in the film because all the same characters have been playing the same roles. I will say that all of the actors in the film have definitely matured in their roles. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have these roles down to near perfection at this point. I liked how good Grint was in the film. His acting skills have definitely improved as the franchise went on. All the acting is solid in this one. I can't even complain about that!<br/><br/>In the end, would I classify ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" the best film in the franchise? No, because I still feel ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" holds that honor. It's is however, the second best film in the franchise and ""HPATDHP2"" does have the potential to being the best film in the franchise. My faith in Harry Potter has been restored and that says a lot considering I was ready to toss the towel in on the franchise, if this film wasn't good but Yates restored my faith. This was a great film even if your not a Harry Potter fan. The pacing, the acting, the story, and the suspense is all very well done with this entry. I think HP fans will be in love with the film and it is not surprise to me that this is the biggest money making film in the franchise. If you haven't already, get to the local theater and check this entry out as you wont be disappointed! MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One"" is a solid 8 out of 10. A terrific beginning to the end of one of the most beloved book and film series in history!"
"Quinoa1984","8","4","6","22 November 2010"," no longer just for kids; a dark adult-fantasy movie with a couple of lulls
","As Harry and Ron and Hermoine and everyone else has grown up, so have the audiences with the Potter franchise. So it should make some sense that by the time the seventh book has come around that it's coming down to the wire: the big showdown between Harry and the Man-We-Don't-Speak- His-Name, oh, whatever, Voldemort. It's usually that the mid-point movie (i.e. Empire Strikes Back) is the darkest one, but there was a quasi-dark ending to Half-Blood Prince, so it makes more sense that the filmmakers take Rowling's Deathly Hallows and turn it into what it should be: a ripping good apocalypse yarn.<br/><br/>I kid a little, but it is a movie with a lot of black contours and desolation, as the trio might be walking through the British version of The Road minus some of the gray-scale photography. That, and the main 'plot' being that Harry has to find the horcruxes, which are items that could be used by Voldemort for very evil purposes. But then the next problem comes as how to destroy them? It's this section of the film, after a very entertaining section where the three go in disguise as full-grown-ups (a funny and intense scene in the Ministry of Magic), that it gets into a rhythm that is not what one would expect in a big- budget holiday blockbuster. A lot of it is sitting around contemplating, waiting, trying to figure things out, and if the audience gets impatient it's not due to the filmmaker's making it bungled but because the characters are having trouble figuring it out too, and we feel for them. <br/><br/>Talking with my wife about the books in relation to the movies, I'm told that book seven is meant to be a character piece for a large part of it when they're in the woods (indeed it's something like a hundred pages of these woods scenes with the three, or sometimes two, of them frustrated in figuring out the symbols and suspense of running from the gestapo- like figures of the Dark Lord). But is Rowling as good at characters as she is at clever plots and intricate details of magic? Yes and no. Yes in that she makes good characters that we want to be around (for the most part, sometimes Ron gets on ones nerves), and no in that they are at best two dimensional figures, even with Harry, and there's only so much character to explore. But there are instances where one can excuse the tedium of some of these woods scenes. A moment where Harry and Hermoine have a levity pause and dance to music could be seen as extraneousness, but when it has the music of Nick Cave signing sad blues, why carp?<br/><br/>David Yates' direction has found after a few of these movies- Order of the Phoenix still the best of his efforts but not far ahead of this one- and he has a classical style as far as big-budget high-action-adventure movies go in Hollywood. He can let an actor's rhythm speak for itself, and he has a really wonderful scene for a whole mess of top-tier British talent (i.e. Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter et all) in the opening scene at Voldermort's castle. When it's exciting such as a fast-paced chase in the sky, it's exciting, and when it needs to slow down there's still attention to be paid to what's going down. Only a few points that a non-book reader such as myself such as a wedding scene for a minor character from movies past and a few points of reference for a couple of items or characters get lost on me.<br/><br/>This is the kind of production that has great attributes and only a couple of damning liabilities, though the former outweighs the latter. There's a sequence where the story of the Deathly Hallows- how the three men who made deals with death for items and things- is told with a unique animation style that has silhouettes and figures that look like a Tim Burton special. It's one of the most breathtaking passages in any Potter movie, sophisticated to the point of impressing any serious fan of fable-storytelling. But the downsides... well, again, some of the pacing in those woods scenes are less than great. But more than that is a kind of curious aspect to the climax, which without spoiling much involves a character who we've only seen in one other Potter movie (I leave this non-spoiler for those who haven't read the books - those that do know what I mean already), and it's a tragic fate for the character. It's a fine moment of drama, but it lacks the punch that was likely there in the book as it's a character who is barely in the film itself and will need some memory-digging for the character's significance before.<br/><br/>But as far as movies where artistic integrity takes place over dumb-loud action and is able to weave visual fx with the practical side of sets and costumes and things with the CGI is very commendable. It's no wonder that Guillermo del-Toro came close to directing this movie, as it appeals to a sensibility that reads the fantastical and supernatural as part of the world, even if one can't see it quite at first. Oh, and the other downside I almost neglected... it's the first part of a two-part finale. It's like getting a half slice of a BIG epic movie, so it's still big, but half-big. But as far as half-slice epics go, it's one of the best in the franchise."
"funkyfry","4","6","11","22 November 2010"," Harry Potter and the Steaming Pile of....
","Like the series of books upon which these films are based, the Harry Potter films continue to degenerate from their inception as a sometimes witty series of fantasy stories with mystery narratives into a character-oriented melodrama with a quest-based narrative. The formula becomes increasingly stale as we go on: will so-and-so find the object needed to unlock to the clue that is needed to unlock the horcrux or whatever the stupid thing is called to do.... something? Mix the tired narrative device with a story where one after another unimportant side characters are killed off and the audience is supposed to be stupefied with shock, and you have something that would really only appeal to fans and even at that the less demanding.<br/><br/>Where there are solid moments in this film is in the comedy and character interactions, which Yates handles well. I often found myself laughing when the film took a breather: Harry and Hermione's awkward dance, Ron's constant protestations which somehow still seem funny, and so on. But the action scenes were bewilderingly directed. There is an entire 2 or 3 minute sequence towards the end when the 3 of them are chased through the woods by death eaters, that has basically zero informational value in any single shot. It's just blurred shots and shots of something moving really fast and cut to somebody's face in terror for 0.5 seconds and so on. This contrasts very poorly with the few action scenes, like the following one in the Malfoy castle, where you can actually see the characters and understand the action.<br/><br/>The fact that the film has no ending is another annoying weakness, created by nothing more than the greed of the producers of this disappointing series. It becomes increasingly clear that the effort they put into the first bunch of films is just not there any more; their fish is hooked and they don't need to put out any more bait. The last few HP films have looked and felt cheap, like a cable TV movie with a slightly higher budget. Yates can do comedy but has no visual flair, and the actors are no longer developing or discovering their characters. It's sort of a routine now, for the movie makers and the audience. I can't say that I care for it but I'll finish the film series at least."

OPEN YOUR EYES!!!!!"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","8","16","18 November 2010"," The only thing 'Deathly' about this movie is how slow it moves...
","Like someone cast an 'Arresto Momentum'/Slowing Charm.<br/><br/>This slog of a movie starts with the most 'minimalist' version of the HP theme yet, as we float through the rusted WB logo. At this rate, we won't even hear the HP theme AT ALL in the final movie's beginning. And while we're at it, can we please put a moratorium on floating through company logos/film titles at the start of movies? It's SO over-used. Bill Nighy close-up alert! He brings his own particular style of speaking to the opening scene, though not even he can make the scene particularly interesting. Surely Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort will liven things up, right?! Not exactly.<br/><br/>Maybe the book moves at a similarly glacial pace, but not being a reader of the HP series, it came as quite a surprise to me that things seemed so dragged out, despite the fact that it was a scene full of villains! A big deal is made of Voldemort commandeering Lucius Malfoy's wand...but non-book readers probably won't get WHY so much time is devoted to seemingly very little happening onscreen. About the only thing of note is some Hogwarts teacher, who was apparently Snape's 'friend', becoming snake chow (would've had more impact had it been a teacher we *knew*. I thought it was Trelawney for a minute).<br/><br/>It's a relief to get to the main trio, and there's a memorable scene featuring seven Harrys (thanks to Polyjuice Potion turning his friends into identical copies of him, though still with their own voices), but this attempt at creating decoys doesn't work so well and they're attacked, with casualties. Hedwig's death upset me, while Mad-Eye's offscreen demise (delivered flatly with one line by Ron's heretofore unseen eldest brother, Bill, who's shown up to marry Fleur Delacour from the 4th film) sadly lacked any impact for something that should've been pretty emotional.<br/><br/>Nighy's Scrimgeour shows up to deliver the trio's inheritance from Dumbledore's will, allowing for a few callbacks to the early films. Instead of spending time with characters we actually KNOW at the wedding, we get a clunker of an info-dump from two characters we don't know delivering exposition, grinding things to a halt, before picking up again with a Death Eater attack and the trio escape.<br/><br/>Things screech to a halt once more when there's a needlessly convoluted plot involving what looks like Dobby the house-elf after he's become old and crotchety (though that's a different house-elf, actual Dobby *does* turn up), another Polyjuice escapade to get the real Horcrux locket from Umbridge at the Ministry (apparently the centaurs *didn't* 'take care' of her like a half-horse Mafia in the 5th film, useless jerks. WHY couldn't that pink b!tch have been one of the casualties in this film?!), and a case of mistaken identity over Ron's assumed form (leading to awkward snogging).<br/><br/>Thankfully, we eventually move away from that messy situation and focus on the trio as they attempt to destroy the locket, which makes funny noises every time they zap it, with little success. Things then take a turn for the Lord of the Rings-esque when they alternate between who's going to wear the Horcrux to keep it 'safe' (great idea...except for making those who wear it go all Frodo-wearing-the-One-Ring-style angry/paranoid, with Ron being the most susceptible, which leads to him looking like a homeless person and arguing with Harry/Hermione, who he thinks have been having late night rendezvous with each other, then abandoning them in a huff).<br/><br/>At this point it must be mentioned that all three main actors have come far with their characters in terms of development and performances. They've 'matured' a lot, and Rupert Grint shows he's highly capable of portraying a weary, mad, downright unlikeable version of Ron who hits Harry where it hurts. Meanwhile, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson prove what great chemistry they have by carrying a good percentage of the film on just their shoulders. A particular bright spot amongst all the doom/gloom is when Harry dances with Hermione to cheer her up. They're just friends...but, oh, what might've been. A Potter gravesite visit and snake attack later, they figure out that Gryffindor sword from film #2 is the key and a mysterious doe Patronus the way to it in frozen pond, where Harry (naturally) goes near-nakedly swimming for it and consequently gets nearly choked by the locket...which shockingly doesn't want him gaining the one thing that can kill it.<br/><br/>Ron finally returns to save the day and help destroy the Horcrux...but not before it is opened and unleashes his worst fears (which isn't just spiders). If you wish to see creepy silver Harry and Hermione snogging seemingly naked together, then this is the movie for you! For the rest of us, it's both an exciting AND CREEPY scene. It's then determined that Luna's dad is the person to go see. Unfortunately, Luna is nowhere to be found and her father proves much less interesting/entertaining than his daughter (though they both dance amusingly at weddings). He's just a weirdo (and NOT the 'fun' variety). He does reveal, though the film's title refers to three items - the Elder Wand, Resurrection Stone and Cloak of Invisibility. We learn the origins of these items via what I thought was one of the few stand-out moments from the movie: a story narrated by Hermione told through a beautifully animated sequence.<br/><br/>The film's climax is where things get REALLY dark, with Bellatrix Lestrange torturing poor Hermione (it's hard to listen to her screaming in pain, since we've gotten to know her/feel close to her character) and an unexpected death (though right before that is the funniest line the character who winds up dead has ever uttered). It's all very depressing by the end. The movie obviously had a lot of ground to cover, but it felt like it kept stop-starting, almost causing whiplash. The film ends on more of a ""That's it??...Huh."" note than one leaving you anxiously awaiting Part 2 (which'll hopefully be better)."
"teenagersrockin","2","15","38","20 November 2010"," This movie isn't bad,its horrible!!
","So,the new Harry Potter movie comes out, and as always, I am all decked to see this one. The book never interested me, I never got ahead of the first one.It appeared too childish, and with huge inspirations drawn from other authors(it doesn't even come close to awesomeness when compared to Tolkien's LOTR).<br/><br/>Though I may call the book a childish trash, the movies of the series always drew me towards it. It may part be Emma Watson, but the magic and its associated fantasies were amazing, with the beautifully crafted castles, dining rooms, classes, the Hogwarts Express, the characters and all that was the brain child of some ingenious creativity. The increasing darkness and suspense were also what kept me interested in the series. But all the good things that were there in the movie were absent from the 7th installment.<br/><br/>There a lot of things lacking in the movie, but the thing that is most absent is the magic. Where are all those spells, and those new tricks that always mesmerized the audience. It looked like a basketball movie without a basketball game in it. The few odd painstakingly dull and pathetic fight sequences weren't just good enough to meet the standards set by the movie's predecessors, namely the one between Potter and Vol De Mort in the 4th movie or the final fight sequence in the 5th. The movie was too slow, some of the sequences were painstakingly boring, and the acting sometimes looked pathetic.<br/><br/>Although I agree to the fact that the movie needed some emotional touch to it, and may have got so in this film, but at many a spots, it looks overdone. And where are all those important events in the book which the guys so thoughtlessly omitted. I never wondered why none of the Harry Potter movies featured in IMDb's top 250 list, but LOTR did, and the simple reason being, they were fun, they were good, and but they weren't simply good enough. But the seventh part of the installment is the worst of the lot.<br/><br/>Final verdict:This movie simply isn't worth the money. Think twice before going for it."
"Argemaluco","5","6","12","20 November 2010"," Tedious and very unsatisfactory
","I am not a big fan of the Harry Potter books, but I did not hate them either.I appreciate their vivid main characters and the fluid ""voice"" from author J.K. Rowling, but I think that the saga suffered from a severe case of ""giantism"", unnecessarily extending itself with ""surprising"" revelations of a doubtful importance; carloads of new characters who are either simple fillers or convenient victims of inept villains; and an out of control ""ret-con"" to justify the twisted narrative roads which lead to nowhere.I honestly think that the story about the young magician could have been told in only three books, but I think that it was Rowling's creative (or economic) ambition what unnecessarily inflated the series.As for the film adaptations of the books, I did not like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; I found Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to be mediocre; and I liked Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, because they condensed the bloated books into competent screenplays, by extirpating the ""straw"" and concentrating on the narrative knot.Unfortunately, that did not happen with the film adaptation of the last book, which was divided in two films as a desperate financial maneuver to extend one of the most successful franchises in film History a little bit more.And having seen the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, I felt it exactly like that: a marketing trick, and not as a genuine culmination of the saga.<br/><br/>When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 ended, I asked to myself: Two and a half hours for this? I think that the important elements from this film could have easily occupied the first half hour from the following film without losing the spirit from the book or the growth from the main characters.Big part of this film is a boring ""road movie"" in which the three main characters run through woods, grassland and mountains...with which purpose? Was that really their plan to destruct Voldemort? For being such a redundant and unnecessary movie, they could have invested some minutes in ""Previously on Harry Potter"", or something like that, in order to have a clearer perspective of the situation and the past events.Of course that that will be unnecessary for the ""hardcore"" fans who know the seven books by heart and spend hours discussing about the sexual tension between Ron Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange (or similar subjects).And I am sure that those fans will find Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 much more satisfactory than me.But as a casual spectator, I found it to be extremely tedious and repetitive.<br/><br/>Besides, the melodrama in this movie feels artificial, while the ""comic relief"" is not funny at all and the action sequences lack of any emotion or suspense (even though the special effects are very well done).And the least I say about the central mystery between the ""horcruxes"" and the relics, the better...it does not make too much sense and it sins from the typical ""deus-ex-machina"" from Rowling.On the positive side, I have to mention that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint bring solid performances.<br/><br/>I think that the biggest problem from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 is that I could never feel a real narrative impulse, or the organic development from a story; I simply found a list of situations and places the film has to visit, but without a genuine cohesion between them.So, in conclusion, I personally found this film to be very boring and unsatisfactory...and if that were not enough, I was left with the impression that this film is nothing more than a financial trick from the executives from Warner Bros. to squeeze more money from the fans of Harry Potter who have been faithful to the saga for almost 10 years."

"d_man1890","6","4","7","20 November 2010"," Where's the Magic?
","Let me start by stating that I'm a huge fan of the books and have enjoyed the movie franchise that followed as a whole. But there are a couple of things that irked me while watching the new addition to the series.<br/><br/>First let me advise anyone who's going to see this movie to watch 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince' first, since the story is a direct follow-up of the previous film. We are approaching the final hour in which Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to face He-Who- Must-Not-Be-Named in a battle to the death. Before he can face Voldemort, Harry must destroy the remaining Horcruxes, pieces of Voldemort's soul that make him immortal. The script itself follows the book quite closely, but it lacks structure. The feeling is as if the movie is just a mash-up of scenes with the same characters without any connection between them. And Kloves (the screenwriter) had to close all the loose ends he had created over the years which feels quite forced, introducing new characters that were supposed to appear in previous movies and so on.<br/><br/>Also, the direction seemed confused and clumsy, borrowing heavily from other movies (Metropolis, Bourne series, Lord of the Rings as an example). This movie had lost its magic. The wands in this movie could have be easily replaced with guns. The shaky cam adds nothing but confusion and the score is somber and un-heroic, it's not memorable as the timeless tune from the earlier movies.<br/><br/>There were a couple of good sides to the movie as well. It's nice to see how much the actors have matured and honed their acting skills. Rupert Grint is worth to mention as the best actor of the trio, simultaneously being funny, dim witted, brooding and heroic. The SFX are top notch, it's too bad that it has to deal with the bluish grayish cinematography that dulls every shot. The chemistry between the actors and characters is apparent on the screen and they're a couple of scenes that adds depth to their relationship.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie falls short with the botched script and the inconsistent direction, but it is saved by the actors, beautiful sets and locations and the SFX. If you're a fan, you won't miss it anyway, and if you're a casual viewer, I advise to watch the previous movie first and not expect too much. 6 out of 10"
"freemantle_uk","9","4","7","19 November 2010"," The darkest Harry Potter yet: bring on part 2!
","Opening with a rusty looking version of the Warner Bros. logo, an ominous warning, Harry and Ron look to the distance with worry and Hermione erases her parents memories of her. It is clear that we are getting a very different type of Harry Potter. Director David Yates sets out to show a gloomy, bleak world where war and repression are about to inflict the Wizard world.<br/><br/>Picking up where ""The Half-Blood Prince"" left off, Dumbledore has been murdered and there is no one left to stop Voldermort. The new Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), states the gravity of the situation. Harry was given a mission by Dumbledore to find Voldermort's remaining Horcruxes (pieces of his soul), but has no idea what they are hiding in, how to find them and how to destroy them. When Voldermort launches a successful coup against the Ministry of Magic, Harry, Ron and Hermione have to go on the run when they are declared public enemies.<br/><br/>Yates had already shown that he could make a dark ""Harry Potter"" film when he made ""Order of the Phoenix,"" but with ""The Deathly Hallows"" he takes it to another level. Like with ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""The Half-Blood Prince,"" he was able to change his style of direction yet again. The repression of the new Ministry of Magic was brought to life, looking and feeling very much like the Ministry of Truth in 1984, with a little bit of Brazil for good measure. There are wonderful little details to windowless environment, the costumes of the wizard enforcers and the 1940s-style propaganda posters. The animated short of ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"" (whose director was given free reign by Yates) was very Tim Burton like: so dark, visually stunning and flowing beautifully with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Yates delivers on the action front yet again, excellent chases from when the Death Eaters chase the Order of the Phoenix in the skies above London and seeing that real people get hurt, the chase in the Ministry and the scenes in the woods. Helena Bonham Carter was finally allowed to let loose and Bellatrix Lestrange is turned into a truly scary character -- we get to see some of the horrors she is able to inflict.<br/><br/>Because of the dark, slow and sombre direction at times there are some effective horror moments and there is a permanent sense of tension and terror. Yates slows the film down long enough to unveil the mystery and quest and show how the characters we know handle their mission. The House Elf Kreacher (Simon McBurney) was made into a nastier little creature with bitterness in his voice who had been taught a hateful ideology. A great of example of all this bleakness is that John Williams' soft signature tune is no longer used in the film.<br/><br/>Senses that were only mentioned in the book are actually shown in the film, following the old screen writing maxim ""show don't tell"" and having much more of an impact for the audience. Yates and Steve Kloves attempt to show the wider picture of the conflict and the ideology of the wizardening world, showing the Death Eaters as being akin to Nazis and Stalinists. But it is not all doom and gloom and there is still plenty of humour and lighter moments, most of it being visual and some funny lines via Dobby and various Weasleys This time round the main three actors have to stand alone with little support from the adults. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have all grown as actors over the years. All three give fine performances, Watson giving her strongest performance in the series and Grint showing more range then just as the comical sidekick. Radcliffe has already proved himself the best actor of the trio and his performance was natural as in the previous films. There is a large number of cameos in the film from actors who have been in the previous films and its great to see the previous film referenced like this. Imelda Staunton returns, being deliciously evil and sickly-sweet as Dolores Umbridge, and Rhys Ifans gives a surprisingly understated performances as Xenophilius Lovegood.<br/><br/>""The Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is one of the strongest entries in the Harry Potter series but there are some faults preventing it from topping the list. When the main three characters are on the road, it is sometimes too slow and some scenes could have been cut or shortened: the film itself is about 10 to 15 minutes too long. Also a problem from the book is that the Horcrux is pretty much lifted from The Lord of the Rings, acting as a corrupt force on anyone who touches it. But all this is minor as the film will satisfy and delight fans of both the books and the films.<br/><br/>I personally really looking forward to the concluding part to the series with what should be an epic finale."
"natasha-pang","1","7","15","25 November 2010"," Characters out of character
","This movie attempts to show the 7th installment of the Harry Potter series in a solemn and depressing view. I watched the movie yesterday with friends, feeling that the 6th movie was reasonably good in telling the story faithfully in mood and conversation. The 7th movie part 1 leaned too heavily on the ""dark and depressed theme"". It fails to capture many of the other moods in the first half of the book--any attempts at humour are quite half hearted and don't bring out the flavour of interaction between the characters in the book(happiness and some liveliness even when Ron returned--all very sluggish and lifeless and even the anger from Hermione was half- hearted). There are also unnecessary scenes--most prominent is the dancing between Harry and Hermione--it contributed little to the plot. Furthermore the interaction between the characters is stiff(supposedly ""depressed"" but failed to integrate with character personality). In addition, some scenes are dragged out and conversation is sparse and when there is conversation it is brief and hurried. I suspect, to give the illusion that the story is progressing at a normal pace, character interaction appears slow but changing between scenes is rapid and each scene is short. The 3 main characters have also lost their personalities--although there are some brief attempts at regaining them. I am also appalled at the usage of Dobby to attempt ""comic relief"" but is totally out of character with the Dobby in the book. I also felt the movie portrayal of Dobby, particularly the lines, to be--no other word for it--cheesy. However, there are some good parts--portrayal of Ron's struggle with the locket is well done, I think and so is the ministry heist. However, the magic is poorly done and Hermione is often sporting a different set of incredibly fashionable wear every scene. The movie gives the feeling of having many shots taken but edited and cut, then strung together by blending blackouts. I really wanted to enjoy the movie but am very let down."
"elie-fares16","10","5","10","17 November 2010"," Brilliant. Best Harry Potter movie of the Franchise, yet.
","I went to this movie with high expectations. I had read reviews saying that the movie can be divided into 3 parts where the middle one is kinda boring. So I went in hoping that wasn't true and I was not disappointed. The whole movie just works - and it follows the book so closely, I couldn't help but be happy throughout. If you're an avid Harry Potter book lover who has been terribly disappointed by the way the movies only use the crux of the books, then this movie is for you. It literally starts almost the same way book 7 starts: ""The two men appeared out of nowhere.."" And it progresses in a way that's almost the exact same way it goes in the book except for a few things they removed to help in the progression of the story and some things they added to make the viewer understand what's going on. A friend of mine went in with me having not watched any Harry Potter movie. And after the question or two of ""what is a horecrux"" and ""who's this"" she got into the movie and now can't wait for part 2. This is the best one in the Harry Potter franchise so far. I give it a 10 because I love Harry and because this is one of my favorite movies this year. You should definitely go watch it!"

","The journey of Harry Potter finally come to the end. The three friends Harry, Hermoine and Ron once were kids and now they are young wizard and witch.<br/><br/>The part 1 of the final chapter of HP7 did a good job in explaining what happened, what is happening and what will happen. The pace of the entire 146mins film catches the audience although some scenes might be a little dull (maybe there's no Ron silliness). Editing is fair and directing from David Yates seems familiar but in HP7 he gave us more surprise. This time the shots and the setting is beautifully done.<br/><br/>Some revision might helps before stepping in the cinema because HP7 part 1 doesn't really show too much of flashback of the previous chapter. Characters from previous chapter share quite a big role here and some just get Charm till death so quick until we wont realize he/she's gone..<br/><br/>Daniel, Emma and Rupert's acting, what can i say.. This 3 kids deserve to get the fame and the spotlight. Besides this 3 obviously is the main character in the film, other supporting actor/actresses also bring the character from the book to film and reality.<br/><br/>Conclusion, if you'd follow HP for the past few year please don't miss the final chapter. It's emotional, it brings memory back. We'd watched Harry from a baby and HP7 is the film which you will see the last battle between Harry and You-Know-Who.<br/><br/>hint: There will be more to watch in HP7 part 2, I swear."

In the end of the film we are all excited what will happen to the next movie.The problem of this movie is that a lot of scenes are slow. No not slow-mo, slow pacing. It's not as magical as the other movies. It's still enjoyable though. Harry Potter and his friends has grown up and it becomes more darker and epic. Nothing else to say. Just enjoy the movie."

","I was looking forward to seeing Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1 but I must say that I am disappointed with what I saw. The film had been stated as a journey mainly between the three main characters and I found it at times interesting and at other times wanting.<br/><br/>There are plenty of intriguing cameos at the beginning from the old cast, notably Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and the delightful Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. Later, other characters of old appear and mainly, it is basically cameo roles for all of them as the majority of the film focuses on the three leads.<br/><br/>I remember reading a review elsewhere and someone said that the film had focused too much on the relationships between the three characters whilst they were on their travels - this is the low point of the film and basically, whilst it cannot be denied it is atmospheric, it offers very little else.<br/><br/>Personally, I can't see this as anything else other than a filler but for Part 1, I must say this was a poor attempt and I thought that they would want us to really enjoy this part so Part 2 would be the real icing on the cake. Unfortunately it didn't turn out that way.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the three main leads are searching for the horcruxes which make up Voldemort's invulnerability - once destroyed, so can Voldemort be. The film focuses too much on just one horcrux. Then the relationships between the three characters are developed as they continue their quest to find horcruxes and make a discovery about how to destroy them. The leads learn more about how they can overcome Voldemort as the film goes on and after a tricky situation, there is a poignant death scene and Voldemort makes a crucial discovery.<br/><br/>The scene is set for Part 2 which I hope is a lot better than this but I must say this is one of the more disappointing fantasy films I have seen for quite some while."
"aharmas","10","4","8","19 November 2010"," Stunning, Dark, and a Great Epic Film
","We have invested nearly a decade, getting to know each of the main characters in this series, and with each book/movie, their personalities and the intense relationship that binds the main protagonists have grown darker and more powerful. In the first installment, we learned that the lives of Voldemort and Potter were linked and the bond might never be severed, even after death. The tone of the books was light and served as an introduction to the magical universe we've grown to love. Seven books later, the universe is crumbling, as Voldemort gains momentum and is getting closer to his prey.<br/><br/>From its superb prologue to its magical closing image, this film shows us how masterpieces are created. We are now witnesses to the perfect marriage of good, old fashioned movie making, a time when solid story telling and characterization were the basis of great cinema and eventual classics; with the help of technology and sophisticated camera work, the latest chapter in Harry's story is definitely the most meditative, deep, and dark. Its director has taken chances taking us in a ride which shows the soul of the three protagonists. Giving sure and heartfelt performances, Rupert, Emma, and Daniel have matured into leading actors, fully able to communicate what lies deep inside their characters' souls. The mid section of this movie moves at a very leisured pace, offering us more than a peek into how close Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are, and what they each mean to each other, and consequently us. The gorgeous photography allows us to experience their loneliness, their devotion, their integrity, and how desperation threatens to overcome and destroy them.<br/><br/>The magic remains at the core of the film, but it shows in a very different way. Yes, there are displays of the epic battle to come, as we witness the principals prepare themselves for the final chapter, but it is the subtlety of each characterization, and how each performer beautifully demonstrates the powerful writing and how well they understand their roles. Although, this is the young heroes' showcase, everyone gets a chance to shine, and at times it is a a matter of combining the perfect line with the right camera angle.<br/><br/>There are hints of what the resolution might be, connections to the past, and they are all elegantly displayed. The flashbacks are kept to a minimum, but each link is effectively shown, with the masterful work of Sierra and Desplat, as they create a mood, revive a theme, and enhance the perfect direction and flawless work of each performer. Two moments stand out among the fantastic work in ""Hallows"": A visit to the cemetery where Harry's parents are buried is a perfect mix of anxiety, sadness, and the power of love. The ending to this chapter is also brilliant as the film offers a most revealing perspective into the dark side.<br/><br/>The film will hopefully increase the appreciation of the cinematic relevance and craftsmanship that remains the strength of the Potter films. Maybe the inclusion of darker themes and touches will earn this epic film the recognition it truly deserves. Here is a movie that explores nightmares of the real kind. Its nature is magical but the pain is real, and unlike a recent film that relied too much on the technical and the relatively incomprehensible exercise of the power of the mind, this one doesn't forget that heart and mind do go together, with matching levels. There are several moments that will haunt the audience, as we realize that we read, see, and revisit this universe because ultimately we care about this fictional trio and their respective adventures and relationships. Hermoine's beautiful mind and soul would be worthless without her connection to Harry's courage and Ron's passions, and as someone once asked in another one of those fictional worlds asked: ""Do you believe?"", we can't help but say, ""I believe, I believe."" This is the best film of the year."
"aragorn_87","10","4","8","18 November 2010"," Magnificently choreographed... Like the book... :)
","I have my hopes high on this one, rightfully so since they decided to split the books into two parts. More time and space to explore and display the complex layer of subplots portrayed in the book. They certainly does not disappoint. This is by far the best film adaptation of the books than any other film in the Harry Potter franchise.<br/><br/>By sticking to the books, David Yates has done himself a favor. He manages to lay out the plot perfectly for the audience especially to those who haven't read the book but follow the movie franchise from the very beginning. From the start, it was one coherent story.<br/><br/>The introduction of Yaxley, the mayhem in the ministry to get the first horcrux, the dangling images of the Hallow sign, the clever animation of the Tale of the Three Brothers, Bellatrix's hair falls on Hermione's cloth, Harry wrestling the wand from Draco's hand, and other minute details was choreographed properly as he takes the audience through the plot and prepares them for part two.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic. The trio plays their characters exceptionally well. Emma and Rupert was outstanding in my opinion. As for Daniel, well lets just say, those two has outshines him this time around. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was a very standout character, Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour certainly look like a lion, Helena's Bellatrix was menacing and torturous as ever, Snape was being himself like he always is, Lucius and Narcissa also plays their supporting role well (I love it when Narcissa shivers as Dobby was making his speech). However, I do think Ryhs Ifans's Xeno was 'over cooked' compare to the Xeno in the book.<br/><br/>Me and my friends certainly did not feel the 146 minutes spend in the theater. This is a must-see for every Potter fans and casual viewers. You wont be disappointing with what they have in store. Instead at the end you'll be dreading for having to wait another 8 month for the next installation."
"dawning_horizon","7","4","8","17 November 2010"," Delightful, in general-but lacking a little je ne sais quoi
","Just got back from a midnight preview of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. <br/><br/>In general, I thought it was an alright film- just not quite up to Harry Potter standard or my expectations, either. From the trailer one would expect lots of action; don't get me wrong, there IS action-rather abundantly too, but it feels like they crammed all the edge-of-the- seat, get-your-heart-racing scenes into the trailer, so I didn't feel like there was anything especially surprising about the film. Everything that was anything was in the trailer. <br/><br/>That said, it does stay rather true to the book, certain scenes are almost translated word-to- image on the screen! I suppose certain fans would say 'Bravo, Yates!', but I beg to differ. Because the scenes were so similar, I knew exactly what was coming next and it filled me with a sense of dread, and I couldn't smile, much less laugh, along with the rest of the cinema-goers. (There was a certain scene where this was particularly apparent, but I shan't spoil the fun.) Thus I felt the film lacked the element of surprise; there were few, if at all, new and refreshing interpretations of the seventh book. I do realize it's difficult to interpret a book (especially one as complicated as Harry Potter), but after all- this is Harry Potter, not some half-rate film, so it would have been very nice if the film had been a little more creative while still staying true to the book. <br/><br/>Also, another notable mention would be that many people in the cinema expressed tremendous disgruntlement 'What? It's ending here?' 'What a cliff-hanger!' 'How CAN they stop here' when the movie ended (quite abruptly, in my opinion) with Voldemort. In fact, it felt almost like that scene was deliberately crafted and pushed forward simply to mark the ending of the 'first part', which further added to my personal feelings that the seventh film should have been a mega 4 hour marathon with a no-stops-allowed and no-holds-barred kind of pace. Perhaps this is why the film didn't leave me trembling with tremulous emotion or anything particularly thought-provoking to think about. It just felt like another Harry Potter film- acceptable for the first couple but not quite for the last. (However, I acknowledge that they had to end SOMEWHERE, given that they split the movie into half. Though if they made the decision to separate the parts, the least they could was to make well sure that the ending was satisfactory and not quite nonsensical, in my opinion. Or else keep it as one. Difficult leaps build up immense anticipation-and they didn't quite live up to mine.)<br/><br/>Hats off to you, J.K Rowling; Yates- not bad, but definitely lacking mystique-wise. One has to wonder, has David Yates and the screenwriters lost their steam?<br/><br/>P.S In fact, one would say, the film lacked that spark of 'magic' (pun intended) that the books have in abundance, and unexpected turns of events (which the film conveys too blatantly and in a slightly in-your-face style, in my opinion) are what makes Harry Potter one of the most ingenious series ever written in our time."
"Apologi","6","6","14","18 November 2010"," Magic in this movie lacks internal logic, which leads to incoherence
","I've always enjoyed the first Harry Potter movies up to the Prisoner of Azkaban, which in its time travel twist is in my opinion the best one of the series. However after that one every subsequent film has been progressively worse. That is the case with the Deathly Hallows (part 1) too.<br/><br/>The reason for this are the magical rules (or the lack thereof) of the world of Harry Potter. The problem with Harry is that the magical world carries in the movies no deep metaphysical meaning. It is a concoction of quirks, popularized fantasy and easy jokes. Now this works very well with a more lightweight children's film such as the three first Harry Potters (which I greatly enjoyed), but as the story takes deeper and darker turns, the rules of the world in which it is played would need more coherence and predictability. If that is missing - as in my opinion is the case with the Deathly Hallows - you just can't take the story seriously.<br/><br/>The seventh movie suffers of this worst. It is manifested in most of the problems being solved - or not solved - in an ad hoc manner. Take Hermione's purse for an example. At one moment, when Ron is almost splinched in apparition, a cure is speedily available, but at other moment, when Dobby is hit by knife, no one can come up with anything to cure him. Why, after all the miraculous escapes from death by the protagonists? This is also the case with spell battles, which are completely unpredictable.<br/><br/>The viewer feels like one is stuffed a story, the internal logic of which one cannot justify. And because of this, who dies and who lives, when one is captured and when one is able to escape etc. seem completely arbitrary. That is just plain bad storytelling. It will work in a more light-plotted story, but not in the drama that the producers are trying to present. Therefore I cannot give this movie more than 6/10, even if I would like to."

","My family have all been fans of Harry Potter, books and movies. My wife recorded all seven books on audiotapes and our grandchildren have listened to them repeatedly. Now they are college students. We all looked forward to this film, the penultimate in the series. I found it hard to follow, and totally boring. My wife said you have to have read the books. I expect a movie to TELL me the story. Perhaps it was too much Thanksgiving turkey the day before, but I actually fell asleep during the movie. Will ""DEATHLY HALLOWS Part II"" be any better? We can only hope.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD... Harry and Hermione engage in a sensuous dance scene, she nearly exposing tantalizing skin. Oh NO! A sex scene in a Harry Potter movie?! Unthinkable. I am not a total prude, but I found this scene inappropriate and totally out of place. It is after all a children's movie."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","2","3","30 April 2018"," It's one of the 'worst' in the series because of its slow pace.
","The cast can't pass for teenagers anymore (though they've been pushing it for a while now, and to say that's the least believable part of the series is a testament to its stellar world building) so it's lucky that the 'school-kid' aspect of the story is the least prevalent so far, with the action taking place entirely outside of Hogwarts. 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)' starts off strong but comes screeching to a halt right after an enthralling sneaky section set inside the ministry of magic, stopping for around an hour with almost nothing happening in terms of plot or character, and it's this section that drags the film down to be perhaps the least successful in the series, tied only with the first. That's not to say its bad, though - far from it. It's just a different beast with a slower pace and something different to offer. 7/10"

"kolbytrosclair","10","2","3","20 July 2016"," Oh, the horror
","Yes, oh the horror. This film to me is actually the darkest Harry Potter film yet. I say this because it is so dark. Many deaths, torturing to many of the characters. Fighting their way, to stop the evil Dark Lord himself down to dust. Many expeditions, adventures, and sad points in this story but as far as we know, Harry Potter after the Goblet of Fire, Harry POtter films have become darker, darker, and dark to the point I would say that this is not a fictional movie but a horror, fiction, thriller it will keep you wanting to have your hands over your eyes, waiting to see the next scene of death and more. It is wild and is very much deserved to be in a 10 star situation. The franchise might have one left but is killing the fans by wanting more, their thirst, for the spells, curses, potions and suspense awaits them for all eternity."
"gollumsmeagolrocks","10","2","3","11 July 2016"," The great elements of each Potter film in one
","The first movie had an amazing expansive world to set its story in. The problem was, it focused more on the building OF the world than the story IN the world. <br/><br/>The second movie also had this problem, although to a significantly lesser degree. Here, the story is minimally interrupted by building up the world its set in and, although the world is interesting and expansive, it served more as a distraction from the story. <br/><br/>The third movie mastered this. The amazing and expansive world is there to help the story, rather than the story being there to help it. The fourth movie also understood this. <br/><br/>But each movie introduced some subtle concept into the mythos. Each concept from each movie is present as a brilliantly used device to tell the story of this film, part of why it is the best one. The first two films had this, but instead of being there to tell the story, it was just there. Here, it actually is there in a way that helps the narrative of the story along, like the books. The amazing mythos isn't distracting, like in the first two films, but isn't ignored almost completely for the sake of the story like in the middle films. <br/><br/>If Harry Potter is the master of death, this film is truly, the master of storytelling."

","It seems as if the screenwriter and director read a quick summary of DH1 and then filled in stunts and big backgrounds. Why bother changing 75% of a book that was 100% great? The excuse that it is impossible to fit the book exactly into the film because of time restraints etc is crap. In this film, as in the 6 before, they filmmakers have added scenes (and therefore film minutes) that weren't even in the book. <br/><br/>Why change it so much? What film bit was better than the book bits it replaced? Many of my favorite scenes and lines are either missing completely or turned on there head and barely recognizable.<br/><br/>After seeing this version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 I wish I had a time turner. Or even better, had been bit with a memory spell so that I could forget morons had tried to turn any of the Harry Potter books into movies in the first place."
"Buddy-51","5","2","3","25 May 2011"," time-marking installment
","In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" the penultimate entry in the decade-long ""Harry Potter"" movie series (it covers only one-half of the final novel with the second half due out at a later time), things are going from bad to worse for our intrepid little band of wand-waving heroes and the people who have taught and raised them. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.<br/><br/>For those who are die-hard devotees of the ""Potter"" series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching ""Deathly Hallows"" must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails). For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow. The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment. Still, that doesn't make sitting through this film any more palatable or entertaining."
"bluelaguna","6","2","3","29 April 2011"," Part 1 ain't partly much
","Steve Kloves seems to always drag his Harry Potter screenplays to as far as he can, getting worse and worse towards the end of the saga. This movie makes few of the basic mistakes of screen writing, over-explaining stuff that don't need explaining and vice versa. It was all alright for the 1 hour mark of the movie, but then the slow dragging started. Poorly written lines, scenes that didn't quite make sense unless you've already read the book, some conflicts that in the end didn't matter, at all. Next time, show, don't tell.<br/><br/>Honestly, I saw no purpose to split the book into two movies, being that the first movie has almost nothing to offer. The CGI effects are excellent as always though, too bad the movie had very few scenes to actually make use of it. I felt like most of the movie, the protagonists were just in the woods sitting with nothing to do, then they suddenly realize something, warp in to a place where the action happens, do stuff, and then warp back to the forest to sulk.<br/><br/>I could summarize the movie like this: Harry Potter fights with Ron, Doppy dies (who wasn't an important character anyway) and Voldemort steals some √ºberwand from Dumbledore's grave."

"RResende","Null","2","3","7 January 2011"," Rootless
","One has to face it; it's not that hard to carry a franchise like this. The books are best-sellers, and teenagers are among some of the resistant hardcore fans for whatever pop phenomena they choose to embrace. The books hit a sweet corner of contemporary souls: the lack of magic in the way they conduct their lives, driven by a vision of the world that has been excluding the power of mysticism, true mysticism, born from the most basic connections between humans and their environment, humans and themselves. The books revolve around bits of old mythologies, and deliver them with a fashionable package, filled with visual and metaphorical elements that ring a bell in our western collective consciousness. Phoenixes, wands, potions, spells...<br/><br/>But i only care for the series because they were made into films, these books don't appeal to me, the films may appeal. And the main option in the building of the 8 (which after all will be 9) films that translate the books was that they would evolve like their main characters, which were at the beginning children. So we started as children's films, evolved to adolescent ""highschool"" films, and know the films have been mapped onto a kind of a hybrid genre, oscillating between the detective story and the action film. This 8th installment falls on this category, as the previous one had. I guess the last one will get closer to the ""return of the king"": epic and visceral. <br/><br/>Apart from that evolution of the films, in some of them we have cinematic concepts that get explored, with more or less success. This is where things get interesting to me. The 3rd film was the best to me: it dealt with an coupling of time and space (that the story of the book supported) and cleverly relied on one of the best explorers of space (through camera) we have today to direct it. So we have the deepest shots in the series, the best Hogwarts, the most magic environment of the series. The Half-blood prince relied on similar principles, but instead of exploring the space, the architecture was cleverly staged, it depended on point of view, framing and mise-en-sc√©ne. It was clever and the best film of the series post- Columbus. <br/><br/>This gets us here, to this film, which represents a radical shift in what has been done before. Again, the story provides the clues for the visual materialization of the film: our main characters are stranded, wandering between multiple worlds, multiple realities, all of them devoid of human elements to anchor the action: snow, woods, rocks. So the rug is pulled on us, and the relatively frantic rhythm of the movie has to do with us failing to anchor our eyes on the expected sets that do Not show: we don't get to see Hogwarts. That may have been a somewhat risky decision, but i believe that at this moment, the fans only want to see the illustration on-screen of the facts they know will happen, so these guys can almost literally do anything they want.<br/><br/>Again, as in the previous film, i appreciated the visual hint: linear time, but rootless sets. But the sets are just not interesting enough, and the effect fades with the multiplication of sets.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5<br/><br/>Http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"notyou2188","5","2","3","28 November 2010"," I guess you had to read the book.
","I had little idea what was happening during this movie. That being said, I've read books 1-4, and I recently (read: three months ago) re-watched all the movies up until this one. Those movies stand on their own-- you don't need to read the books to appreciate them or be entertained.<br/><br/>That's not quite the case with this movie. There's a lot that's going on. And the crazy thing is, there's a lot of time spent on drawing out scenes which makes no sense. So pretty much, you have these long drawn out scenes, then you have a flurry of story elements and characters thrown at you that anyone who hasn't read the book will be confused by. Apparently a lot of these plot points will be explained in the second movie, mainly everything regarding what the hell was going on, why the sword was where it was, how they found stuff, etc. But frankly, if you haven't read the book, you will just be disappointed and feel betrayed. A great deal of plot points make no sense unless you already know what's happening. That's the main problem with this movie.<br/><br/>But is it a bad movie? Not really. It definitely has some entertaining parts (particularly in the second half of the movie), but it does have some cringe worthy, confusing, and frankly lame sequences. If you've read the book I can almost guarantee you will enjoy the movie. The problem is, this is a movie-- you shouldn't have to rely on the book to get the full experience."
"sanmarpotter","10","2","3","22 November 2010"," Best potter film by far... yet.
","I LOVED IT. Not only has it been my favorite Harry Potter movie and was able to surpass HBP (which I thought was very hard), but it has been my favorite movie of all time. Like all harry potter movies have been, but this one was just¬Ö. Incredible.<br/><br/>As you can see, I'm a huge fan of the movies, but let me point out I'm a bigger fan of the books, and Deathly Hallows was my favorite by far. So I guess that it didn't come as a surprise that this movie was my favorite.<br/><br/>But let's clear something: a huge fan I may be, but I'm not a crazy fan who'll just put 10 to every hp movie, regardless of what's in it. I like movies in general, all sorts (yes, I've seen the godfather and a lot of others critically praised movies, so I have references).<br/><br/>Now, DH1. Before I begin, I'm gonna have to admit that it took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate it. And even though that, I could tell the movie was amazing and that I'd really liked it. But in my second viewing I just admired everything. And that's what's gonna happen every time I watch it again.<br/><br/>First of, the acting was top-notch this time, better than ever. The older cast, as usual, was incredible, but it is of the trio I'm talking about right now. Even though OOTP and HBP had showed us that these guys had supreme talent, it is in this one that we see they're excellent actors. Dan Radcliffe makes every scene his own, and makes us laugh and gasp and cry if he wants to. His transmission of emotion when a certain character dies is breathtaking. Emma Watson steps up her game incredibly, and we can see that the exaggeration of the eyebrows is way in the past. It is one specific torture scene that shows she's grown into an incredible actress. And well¬Ö Rupert Grint. He steals every scene he's in, and we can finally see another side of Ron, a scary in a good way side. There is a certain fighting scene or a locket scene in which he is just perfect. And Toby Jones as Dobby is totally worth mentioning.<br/><br/>I think it's time to say that this is the best adaptation yet. I can separate book from movie, because they're different mediums. But in DH1, it's like you didn't even have to. Attention to detail was impressive, and almost every part of the books was there. Did there had to be cuts and additions? Yes. But the final project was so epic that, even though in the first viewing I noticed some changes, in the second viewing I just forgot about it. So (as usual, I might add, but better than ever) I congratulate Steve Kloves for his script. It was incredible, and I think there'll hardly be disappointments this time from book purists. The only thing was Dumbledore's past, but that's like another book, and a couple of scenes which I'm happy with now.<br/><br/>The visual effects were top-notch. Every single scene that needed them handled them perfectly, and I'm proud to say that, even though there was a lot of action in the movie, the visuals were there to help the story, not to replace it. It was amazing: the house elves were admirable, the seven potters was just perfect, so was Bathilda (and terrifying, by the way), the locket scene, Malfoy manor, and so much more. Tim Burke and his crew did an amazing work, and if the Oscars have some credibility by now, it should totally win or at least get a nomination. <br/><br/>The score was amazing. In my first viewing I was kind of disappointed, but I know better now. It had to be discrete, not very loud, and had to capture the tension of the movie at all times. It achieved that and more. Even though Hooper's HBP and William's SS remain my favorite, Desplat worthily made it to my top 3. All I can say is that I can't wait to hear his score for the final hp movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography was amazing by Eduardo Serra, showing us very beautiful landscapes and still making us see the tension. As Delbonnel didn't win, he should. <br/><br/>Stuart Craig did just amazing as production designer, everything was so detailed and like the book. I have to admit I imagined a lot of the sets just like that in the book. He deserves a nomination too, and, in my opinion, he deserves to finally win. <br/><br/>Yet my biggest congratulations go to David Yates, his direction was as best as ever, improving the actors, enhancing the visuals, camera and score and costume and everything, and keeping a great pace with laughs, sobs and gasps. I totally disagree with the critic's opinion about slow tent scenes because, actually, the movie is so great that you feel they were 20 minutes. Yates captured the feel of the book perfectly. IMO, it's lucky that we have him, and I just can't wait to see how he ends the series, because I know it'll be brilliant just as he has done in OOTP, more in HBP and definitely in DH1. And well, how could this movie have gone wrong with such and amazing cast, crew¬Ö and most of all, story. Jo Rowling gave us the best book ever, and its first half adaptation lived to its expectation. So it's all thanks to Jo, who by the way, made a terrific producer too. <br/><br/>So I can't wait to watch it again, and I can't wait (sad as it may be) to see the last movie. 10/10"

","Not the strongest beginning to the end of the Potter franchise, I must admit! Yates is not who I imagined, would handle this one...but alas there it is, it's done! There were a few issues I had with the movie itself...The cast is great as always, and never thought they took away anything from the movie however...<br/><br/>Yeah...the editing is not this movie's strong suit...among other things. It was good, but I am still of the belief that for the end movie they should have sought the services of another director. David Yates is a competent director, but he just that, I don't see any imagination on his part, no originality, he is able to deliver a competent visual version of the story, but that is where everything stops.<br/><br/>Personally, I would have wanted to see Alfonso Cuaron return at the helm of the franchise. ""Harry Potter And The Prizoner Of Azkaban"" remains my favourite of the entire franchise, followed closely by Mike Newel's ""Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire"".<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it is still a good movie, but I don't know how to put it in words, its as if the magic is lacking from the movie...its as if the film is in an odd way flat and subdued...even Chris Columbus got that part right... I also expected more from Alexander Desplat (he did a wonderful job with ""Syrianna"") in the soundtrack department, it is though, after the fourth movie they just stopped caring about the music, which is so important to the movie franchise.<br/><br/>A 7 out of 10 for now, but I must stress this, I cannot fully grade the movie until I have seen the second part, only then, when I have seen the movie in its entirety will I give a final rating...Oh well I'll wait until next July!!!! When all is said and done, I will give a more detailed review of ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows""...<br/><br/>PS For full disclosure...part of this review also appears as a posting on one of the IMDb general discussion threads..."
"calspers","7","1","1","28 March 2020"," The penultimate carefully told tale
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) is the penultimate film in the series, and once again directed convincingly by David Yates. After the death of Professor Dumbledore, circumstances are darker than ever, and so is this film.<br/><br/>I actually really like how Dealthy Hallows is divided into two parts, as these are clearly the most slow-paced of all of the films. Part 1 is concerned with horcruxes, and the atmosphere created throughout the film is brilliantly ominous and intricate.<br/><br/>One of my favourite films in the series, as Yates is very focused and simultaneously careful and patient in delivering us this film."
"Min111","Null","1","1","16 March 2020"," The first part is better
","It's the final movie of Harry Potter except it comes in two parts. This movie is part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's one long movie, and that's a good thing because the story in both these movies is very interesting. To be honest, I think it hasn't been this interesting since Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I'm not really a fan of the movies which followed afterwards until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came. I think this was the first movie to come in parts. It was a good thing considering it's the final Harry Potter movie, and we all know how long the books are, so there are a lot of things to cover. I think it was the first time any movie franchise has done that. Soon, others followed such as the Avengers (Infinity War and Endgame). Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows happens to be one of my favourite movies of the series, but I liked part one more than part two. In part one, not only the story is more interesting, but this is a movie which seems to build-up everything before the epic conclusion, and I liked that. In this movie (part one), you know still that there is a long way to go before the movie is finally over! In part two, it's more to do with the ending which everyone looks forward to the most. If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will like this movie."

","Deathly Hallow Part 1 was always my least favorite. It was dark and intense. Now after rewatching it, I loved it. The intensity brought on the suspense and the darkness added to the story well. This movie has really outdone itself. I have seen it so many times now that when I watch it again I find things I never heard or seen before. I love the surprises it gave me. Rupert, Emma, and Daniel really have the chemistry that draws you in! I recommend seeing this immediately if you have never seen it. It is beautiful in every way."

","Wow this was way better then I had remembered. It's the beginning of the end and it's done so well. Part 1 films are usually really bad, filled with an abundance of exposition, and lacking any enjoyment, but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 manages simultaneously to setup the epic conclusion to the saga and to tell a great emotional ""road trip"" type film that feels fresh in the likes of the franchise so far.<br/><br/>My main love for this film is how of everything that has happened the story is mainly about the trio. I mean every film is about them, but here it shows the emotion and heart wrenching destruction and rebuilding of their friendship. It continues the story all while telling a dark tale of life changing events that lead the characters to fully mature and to face the challenges that are in front of them.<br/><br/>The trio gives their best performance here with such enthusiasm and charismatic ways that make their friendship feel even stronger. The way they destroy and rebuild their friends feels so real and feels like a breath of fresh air. The scene in which Harry and Ron fight is one of the best of the series and throughout the entire series you knew they would remain friends but here you don't know and it gives a tense of fright. Also the scene in which Harry and Hermione dance in the tent despite everything that's happening and everything that could happen shows how strong they've grown and manages to be one of the best parts of the entire film series.<br/><br/>David Yates has returned and seems to be the director the series was looking for and with Deathly Hallows: Part 1 he continues to be excellent had having a good looking film and films expertly well. Along side the technical aspect of cinematography, the film manages to be one the franchises best looking films to date. The film inspresses with Alexandre Desplat's score that brings a warmth and his own special sound that compliments the magical world phenomenally. It's soars in its beauty of filmmaking as David Yates pulls everything together in a bundle of joy and darkness.<br/><br/>Managing to be almost two hours and thirty minutes, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 flows very well and doesn't seem dull or have boring moments. With some slower less action scenes it's hard to do that and this film does it exceptionally well. But the set pieces don't go to waste as the film also has some great action and one hell-of an ending. With an exceptional character driven story, that has great performances, a good story, and a well directed film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 manages to lay the ground for an epic conclusion and be an entertaining film all around."

","From special effects to acting to plot to dialogue, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is perfect in every way and utterly flawless. There are so many memorable scenes I can't even decide which is my favorite. The memory wipe, the Seven Potters, Ron's Splinching, Gregorovitch's interrogation, Nagini's ambush, the Three Brothers, Malfoy Manor, and most of all the undying friendship and loyalty and utter co-dependency that's been keeping this franchise together, there's literally nothing to be hated and everything to be loved. This movie reinforces the real stakes and everything makes sense thanks to years of build-up. Plus it's nice to leave wizarding boarding school for a change and get out there in the wild where anything can happen. No doubt this masterpiece will be burned into my subconscious for the rest of my life."

"samuelroberts-45076","6","1","1","6 November 2018"," Not bad, one of the worst in the series though
","With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody. Acting was superb like in every other film, probably because of the strong, British cast that has dominated the franchise over the years. The main 3 were again excellent and carry the film on their shoulders. Despite the good performances i found the characters in this film, not particularly enthralling and quite melodramatic at times. Yates' direction in Order of the Phoenix and again in this one is a bit off in my opinion and the tone was all over the place. The film is like a roller coaster, with giddy high points, either in the action or the tone, but there are also many low points with nothing in the middle. I respect and understand the decision to make this movie in the first place, trying to fit both part 1 and 2 in the same movie would be a catastrophe in many ways. That being said, it was very bland and boring at times, the beginning and end were pretty good but the middle of the film was just amateurish. The whole plot line with Ron is aggravating and completely out of character and the very little subplots it had were rushed and under-developed. Another complaint i had was the lack of chronological storytelling, scenes and acts could be easily switched without much change and the film felt disconnected. Overall, i think this film was still good and can see why people like it, but nothing compared to other movies in the series."
"alindsay-al","6","1","1","16 September 2016"," An above average but ultimately disappointing film
","I have almost finished my harry potter series an I have just watched the deathly hallows part one and ultimately like it's predecessor the half blood prince it is alright but I believe it is a bit disappointing. The premise of the film sees harry, Ron and Hermione going after the horcruxes that give voldermort his power. Daniel Radcliffe is known for his role in these films and he has really matured into a great character. Harry is much darker in this film because of the events of the previous film and Radcliffe does a really good job of making us buy the pressure that his character is under. Hermione and Ron are more pivotal in this film and they are great, you can tell they are growing closer together but they still argue like an old married couple. The three characters chemistry together and development is clearly the best part of this film. Unfortunately though the rest of the supporting characters aren't given any time to shine and come across as forced cameos for the most part. The story has some great character development between our heroes and you really want to see them succeed. However, it does come across as a basic treasure hunt an it just feels like setup for the next movie. The script is allot darker and has some great drama that you actually believe. But it does lack the humour that has made these characters more relatable. The style of this film is better then the previous, there are way more action scenes in this film with the darker tone working for the action scenes. But like the majority of these films it does drag a little bit and this film does slow down at a point quite allot. Overall I thought this was an alright film but it does feel like a setup for the next film which I hope is fantastic."
"JeffTheBadger","6","1","1","3 January 2014"," Is the magic of Harry Potter finally fading...?
","Having rather enjoyed the films to date I went to the screening with an expectation of magic and wonder¬Ö I left with a feeling of disenchantment and disillusionment<br/><br/>As an adult watching; the movie opens well enough with dramatic and visually exciting scenes leading into an involving if a little chaotic storyline, however as the movie continues it does begin to drag, the lack of screen time for the adult actors is a shame as many of the younger cast seem to have had enough of being a part of this franchise and are now just running through the motions, the one saving grace to this is Rupert Grint who is funny and engaging as Ron, Harry's ever present best friend, and delivers some of the best lines of the film with wit and charisma.<br/><br/>For a child watching I would say that it might be a little confusing as to what was happening and then eventually, when no explanation comes, would be a little boring topped off by too scary towards the end (some children had to leave during the showing I was in).<br/><br/>As I am sure many of you will already know, there are many significant scenes that have been omitted from the book but I honestly don't feel that this in itself is a problem. I get the feeling that they were thinking about the upcoming final 2 part instalment the whole time they were making this film and with that in mind I look forward to bigger and better things. Regardless I'm sure fans will flock to see it and will no doubt come away hungry for more. So has Harry Potter lost it's magic, probably not but maybe some of its charm."

The series started out great as an all family can watch films but now this has been dropped for a miserable, depressing, drab direction which doesn't fit in at all with the other earlier films. I don't know what JKR is thinking when writing but maybe she was in a dark mood herself and took it out on Harry Potter? This needed the old spark of Harry Potter film magic but its too late now! How anyone would want to watch this film again is a mystery. JKR will hopefully take a break from writing and think about letting other authors write Harry Potter stories about Harry's earlier times at magic school which would be good to see?"

We knew, even without spoilers from viewers, the series was bound to get darker, more deadly ‚Äì or is that, deathly? ‚Äì and seriously serious. Harry had to grow up finally and begin his final stages to get to his nemesis, No-Nose.<br/><br/>Well, it was welcome, after the terrible, over-kill bridge movie Part VI was. That one, Half-Blood Prince, connected the exciting, thrilling and best of the series, Part V, or Order of the Phoenix, and this first chapter of the finale.<br/><br/>Yes, my opinions are not well-received, but allow me to honestly say just that: I was honest in my feelings towards Part VI ‚Äì it contained 20 special, interesting and important minutes, but the rest was garbage. If only those were tacked onto this one, or the previous, it would've flowed better.<br/><br/>I digress, we're here for HP7a. School's out for¬Öever, it appears as Harry and the good witches of all directions are on the lam after No-Nose and his army is preparing to devastate everything.

But, anyways¬Ö<br/><br/>The mystery of the series, the adventure and most of the heart is back as Harry's pals get beaten down, and the overall threat is more real. It's actually a fairly simple plot of gathering objects and clues, but the route to both was rather fun, albeit slow at times.<br/><br/>In Part VI, a significant character passes onto the Magical Kingdom of the Sky, but the one character who dies here (obviously, no spoilin') in the finale actually affected me the most. And yes, I'm even jumping ahead to HP7b¬Ö of all 8 movies, the one that dies here almost made me tear up and I'm sorry to see her/him go.<br/><br/>At any rate¬Öeven with a rather slower mid-section, the movie starts off with a punch, it's fun, dark, mature and finishes at a perfect time to get you psyched for the grand finale to come¬Ö<br/><br/>(Editor's Note: I decided to listen to the masses for this Harry POTter phenomena and revisit the series.

Starting with III the movie makers took over and any soul out of the story.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is no difference.<br/><br/>Here are the worst missed chances and screwed up scenes:<br/><br/>1.) Departure of the Dursleys - no nice words from Dudley for Harry whatsoever, they just pack and leave. <br/><br/>2.) Scrimgeours reading of the last will: it is indeed more of a grandfatherly reading, no confrontation whatsoever. Very important scene in the book. <br/><br/>3.)

Aunt Muriel?? Doesn't really happen. <br/><br/>5.) Kingsleys Patronus - no dramatic effect whatsoever.<br/><br/>6.) Suddenly the kids are at the Ministry. Way too suddenly. <br/><br/>7.) The new monument in the ministry, which sends an important message can not be seen completely. <br/><br/>8.) The interrogation scene is not nearly dramatic or frightening enough. And it's good to know that lift doors stop dementors... <br/><br/>9.) WHY, God, WHY didn't Ron say ""I see, you chose him"" instead of that lame ""I saw you two the other day""?! <br/><br/>10.) Harry and Hermione dancing - totally pointless and ridiculous, wasted time that could have been used for important other scenes. <br/><br/>11.) Bathilda Bagshots transformation was ridiculous, and if Harry had come that close to her in the book, he would have realized there was something wrong. And where the hell was Voldemort?! <br/><br/>12.) Harry realizes his wand is broken, his wand that worked on his own account against Voldi and used to be his most powerful weapon against the Dark Lord, providing the unique connection. You'd think Harry'd be at least a LITTLE desperate or devastated. But not in this movie. He just spits out: ""It's done, get some sleep!"" <br/><br/>13.) Ron saves Harry - well, you'd think that Harry would be a LITTLE more surprised, or thankful, or overwhelmed - so many emotions to pick from. Yates tells Daniel to show - nothing. <br/><br/>14.) I missed Lovegoods ""Of course none of you has ever seen such a cloak"". The whole Deathly Hallows were apparently nothing important, just something mentioned somewhere in the movie. <br/><br/>15.) Instead of getting killed by his artificial hand for showing mercy Wormtails get's pinched with a wand, squeaks ""Ouch!"" and falls over. Dramatic!! <br/><br/>16.) Last scene: Voldi blasting some flames up to the sky after taking Dumbledores tomb. No tension like in the book - will he get there before Harry, must Harry stop him, will Harry chose the Hallows over the Horcruxes, is Voldi aware of Harry existing at all?!<br/><br/>The book is filled with close escapes, and the book manages to take the drama and tension almost completely out of the story, or what remains of it.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the Deathly Hallows and their impact is not handled well.<br/><br/>Everyone looks great, especially the three kids.<br/><br/>But this film, like most of his predecessors, has no heart, no soul and gives a sh.. about the books and the compelling and masterful story.<br/><br/>4/10"

"robastyk","Null","1","1","15 July 2011"," Harry Potter and the Deadly Pacing
","I suppose it was inevitable. As J. K. Rowling became a phenomenon her books got less and less editing though they needed it more and more. With the cynical, money-grubbing decision to make two films out of the last book a similar thing has happened. The triangular friendship and love of Ron, Hermione and Harry provides the personal, human tension of the over-all story but we all know that it can't be resolved until the last chapter/reel. The consequence is this movie bloated with empty calories to deprive us of the price of a ticket bought more to say we've seen the whole epic rather than because we've been truly entertained. We get a few loose ends tied up and a brilliant animated sequence telling the back story of the Deathly Hallows. Unfortunately more of the movie than any narrative line can stand consists of the three young people wandering the English countryside to no particular purpose except to pad out the space between opening and closing credits. At best the film is an over-long trailer for the final installment. Poor Harry and his friends haven't been this badly served since the series wisely, thankfully jettisoned director Chris Columbus and his attempts to drag the series down into the hell of Home Alone with witches. The best I can say of this film is that someday, in order to sell more copies of the series, someone may re-cut the films and combine Deathly Hallows Parts I & II into something like a watchable film. I have no confidence in that, however. The fashion is to add scenes that were left on the cutting room floor and, usually, should have made it to the cutting room incinerator. I am a father of the children of the Harry Potter generation and thus once removed from Potter-mania. Still I also have a deep affection for Daniel Radcliffe's and his Harry, Emma Watson and her Hermione and Rupert Grint and his Ron. I have watched them grow as I watched my daughters grow. Thus it's partly out of fatherly affection that I dislike this installment as a great disservice to three young actors who have worked hard and deserved better."
"joelmg","7","1","1","9 July 2011"," I confess myself disappointed
","I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, both the movies, and the books, and I'm afraid that this one didn't shine, it was merely adequate.<br/><br/>First, there are many themes that continue through the books, and they weren't followed in the movie. Normally, I would say that this is just somebody being picky, but I was let down. Each book starts with a scene with the Dursleys, and although I was moderately disappointed with the absence of Dumbledore's lecture to the Dursleys at the beginning of the Half Blood Prince, I was OK with it. But to eliminate Dudley's farewell to Harry to me was scandalous! I knew it would be in the special features of the DVD, however, it was poorly acted, poorly directed, and looked like an afterthought. It was a conclusion to a main subplot and it's absence did not go unnoticed.<br/><br/>I was unhappy in general with the adaptation to film, and the directing. The scene on Privet drive when all of the order and friends come to take Harry for example. The dialogue seems unnatural and awkward, as well when Harry tries to sneak away from the burrow and Ron catches him, when Harry was speaking to Elphias Doge. In my opinion, somebody on set should have told Daniel Radcliffe to stop flashing his left hand every time he wanted to look serious.<br/><br/>And finally, there were too many things that weren't taken care of in a proper order, and instead needed to be thrown in haphazardly. For example, Bill mentioning being bitten by Grayback, Ron spurting out, ""Did you say you needed a wand? I got one!"". And it would only have taken a second longer for Harry and Ron to have their text dialogue after Ron returned (when Ron says""Dumbledore knew I'd leave"", to which Harry says ""He knew you'd want to come back""). I feel like that was an unnecessary change that takes from character development.<br/><br/>And I was very disappointed when Mundungus Flecher just looked down at an old newspaper and pointed out Delores Umbridge. It was so poorly done. He could have said anything there, ""Short woman, dressed in pink, with this sickening little giggle"".<br/><br/>But nothing disappointed me more than Dobby's death scene. It was too quick. He died, Luna closed his eyes, then Harry blurts out how he wants to bury him.<br/><br/>The whole thing just seemed too rushed, as if they didn't take the time to ensure that the writing was complete, and the scenes were filmed properly.<br/><br/>As well, as much as I love Bill Nighy, I feel like Scrimgeour should have been played by Peter Mullan. Just saying. Personally, I thing Bill Nighy should have played Olivander, and John Hurt should have played Xenophilius Lovegood.<br/><br/>I still enjoy the movie though. I just hope that I get the sense of conclusion that I want out of the second part."

Even after obtaining the dvds, and re-running scenes over and over to try and see just what was going on, these blacked out segments were not worth the effort. Couple that with the other annoying Hollywood technique of using jiggly hand-held cameras, and this last installment becomes a candidate for scrapping and re-shooting. David Yates, are you listening?? Don't waste film, talent, and time -- let us SEE your work, not guess at it."
"skachick7000","7","1","1","1 April 2011"," Excludes most of book, but overall good movie.
","I was very excited to see this movie, being the 7th book has become my favorite of the entire series. After seeing it however, I felt utterly disappointed but I also felt awe at the visualization of the film. So, I both loved it and hated it. Let me explain...<br/><br/>The major error this film made was excluding A LOT of stories from the book, and if most if these had been included (like they should have), then this would have made for an amazing and much better movie. They leave out: Harry saying goodbye to the Dursleys, the entire setup of the wedding & Harry's planning, half of the conversation between the Prime Minster and the group, Kreacher's story of the locket, the planning of infiltrating the Ministry of Magic, talking with Black's portrait, Wormtail's death, and the biggest plot point of them all: the fight in Harry's mind over whether Dumbledore was really the man he knew and which was more important, hallows or horcruxes? By leaving all of this out, it just became a movie about camping.<br/><br/>Why was all of this left out? It would've been a much more exiting movie. I also can't stand how little dialogue there is in this movie and all of the other movies he directs, there is so much quiet you can hear crickets chirp. There were so many moments when just one little line from one of the characters could've explained the scene or what was going on, or could've just added to it! <br/><br/>But I have to say what I enjoyed about this film was the action and seeing some of my favorite scenes from the book come to life (albeit however loose an adaptation it was), like the great escape, the snatcher scene and of course Dobby.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping the next movie will at least tie up some loose ends!"
"kdnor2011","10","1","1","21 December 2010"," One of the Best book to film adaptations ever
","I loved it, this is the perfect buildup to the finale, and one of the best book to film adabtations I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I swear, some of this stuff was word for word in the book, like the scene in the tent when Harry and Ron are fighting, I think they didn't have a script, Yates just handed them the book and told them to read that. Once again, the acting, effects, and production value are all great. And the comedy is some of the best in the series. Some complain that nothing happens, well thats the point, it's all buildup, it may seem tedious, but once the you see the final film it will all be worth it.<br/><br/>However this film does have some really stupid moments. I know that Pettigrew killing himelf may have been too graphic, but did you have to make that scene so stupid, just stupefying him would have been better. Also, where the hell are the Dursleys, THEY FILMED IT, I have the DVD, I saw the deleted scenes, they showed Harry and Dudley saying goodbye, and it was good, why did they cut it? In the end, Dudley's face is never seen and Aunt Petunia doesn't get a line. There are a few other things, but there all nitpicking.<br/><br/>A lot of people hate it because it's boring, but I was not bored once during the whole film. It's buildup, and it will all payoff."

","First, i have to admit, i've never read any of the books, so i'm not a die hard fan, but i have seen all the films.. and this review contains spoilers! The pace and content of the previous films have always been good. The films were visually stunning, the acting excellent, and the pace of the films kept drawing you into the story.... sadly the same cannot be said for Deathly Hallow, part1...<br/><br/>The action scenes are too few and fast paced and seem to gloss over events that would have made good cinema (like the death of mad eye), there is almost no time given to introducing characters that people who haven't read the books aren't familiar with, and the pace of the film is... well, there's no other way to say it, glacial. If you were watching this at home you'd be reaching for the remote to fast forward.<br/><br/>The scenes of the trio wondering through the woods wondering what to do next are an interesting narrative, and work for the first few minutes, but half the film is devoted to this introspective soul searching and it quickly becomes boring... half the people around me were playing with mobile phones during these scenes whilst waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>I came away with the suspicion that this is a padder to string the films out a bit longer and cash in on the popularity.<br/><br/>Bottom line.... if you're not a die hard Potter fan, and haven't read the books, then avoid this film. Wait for the DVD and keep the remote handy."
"bowakawa","5","10","30","18 November 2010"," Stretching what would be the first 40 minutes of a Harry Potter movie into a full 2 and a half hour movie?
","So, did they split Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two movies for money? Or did they do it so they didn't leave anything out? Either way this movie was boring, and I mean really boring. The movie follows Harry, Ron and Hermione seeking out the remaining Horcruxes to once and for all defeat Lord Voldemort or, well, it's supposed to. For the most part it's just them sitting around a campfire, no joke, a journey that would have been done in a ten minute montage in the other Harry Potter movies is stretched out into three quarters of the film. The movie also expects you to have read the books, it often takes onto another scene or portion of the film without explaining what's going on whatsoever, it goes from the wedding scene, to the streets of London to them going on a camping trip/journey without much explaining of what's going on. I have also read a lot of reviews saying this movie is the most action packed of them all so far, which is not true at all, in fact, I would argue that this is the least action packed. Really nothing much happens through the whole film, there are three scenes I think where Death Eaters attack, and they're quite fast and are over quickly, and just as the movie starts to pick up, it ends! Which is ridiculous since the movie goes for two and a half hours. This movie was a bore and a let down too, nothing much happens throughout and it's very slow paced and seems to drag on. The movie is only saved by some good performances by the lead cast, and a quite witty nod to the 'Twilight/Harry Potter war'. 5/10, 2/5"
"frankbloemhof","5","12","38","16 November 2010"," Best and worst so far..
","Having just come home from this movie at a night-premiere near where I live, I decided to write a review about a movie I had thoroughly mixed feelings about.<br/><br/>You see, on one hand I really do think they put in most of the important events from the book (in contrast with some of the previous Harry Potter movies) and the effects were definitely great, as was the acting.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, I couldn't help thinking how boring it was. At some points during this movie, when all the action stopped and I actually felt like I was wasting my time with this, I thought: Well this is bloody awful! But then of course, something funny happened.<br/><br/>And that seemed to be what saved this movie. Humor. Not the action, not the effects (even though they were great) but the humor. I don't think I've ever laughed this much during a Harry Potter movie, and I think I wasn't the only one. Honestly it felt more like a comedy mixed with some startling moments and a little bit of action, heavily based on what was probably the most gloomy book of them all.<br/><br/>And that is why I think this movie, although probably the best in the series so far, was also quite boring (at times) and thus not a particularly good feeling.<br/><br/>Do how-ever take note that most of the people I saw it with didn't agree with me at all, so don't be discouraged to see it. Just don't go in with your expectations too high or you might be let down. And I don't think anyone wants that."

","Well, 6.5 actually. The parts that felt like normal movie speed were excellent, but there were just so many other parts that felt like absolute slo-mo, borderline painful! It was so clear that the guys who made the flick were reeeeealy stretching it thin so it turns into two movies. Hey, double the product, double the cash-cow. Unfortunately really, as they could have easily made it a 3-hour movie at normal plot speed and called it a day, and saved us all some $ and more importantly pain and time. But, that said, do check it out, as 60% of it is quite good, and since you have no other choice but to see the whole thing if you want to see the good parts - and it also shows us how juicy part 2 will be, as I imagine its speed will be much much faster. It would have to be! Enjoy, but be ready for the slo-mo."

","At last the World of Harry Potter comes to real life. You never found this world of Wizards and Witches, the world of J.K. Rowling, as alive as in this movie. It all works out. With this movie J.K. Rowling is now responsible for a real true artwork. David Yates translates the book perfectly into a movie and he does that with a language and style which will make this movie unforgettable. <br/><br/>It is the the perfectly balanced entertainment. Between all threats, all evil there is a lot of love and humor and the Harry Potter-stuff finally becomes the awesome adventure it always could have been. The great thing about it is, that this great adventure, this thrilling story, this wondrous and fantastic world is carried by real characters and the movie takes it's time for them. There is real drama going on.<br/><br/>I don't know how it to watch The Deathly Hallows without knowing the books or movies before it, but I know, that this movie-part was just absolutely satisfying for me. There is no weak point, nothing to complain for me. <br/><br/>To put it in a nutshell: David Yates' directing is marvellous, it's pure energy and pure sensitivity for drama and story.<br/><br/>Perfect :)"

","I have to say, I honestly thought this movie was going to be a mess. After the Half-Blood Prince, I didn't expect ANTHING from this movie, the adaptation from the 6th book to the screen has to be worst one I've ever seen in my entire life, I was truly disappointed, as I haven't been a fan of HP movies since probably the 2nd one. But I truly have to say that this movie blew my mind. Every essential, detailed part of the book is seen on the film, and it's perfectly introduced for the second part of it. I had honestly forgot how it felt like to compare things I've read from HP to what I was seeing on the screen, but I did this through the entire film. The movie is dark, which is contrasted by funny moments, is deep,is truly a flawless adaptation from the book and I couldn't be more pleased about it. I will recommend this movie to all HP fans and also to the people who haven't read the books because it is a great movie, and the actors are perfectly chosen and do an amazing job."

","Potter fans will do their nut, the rest of us will wonder what all the hype was about...<br/><br/>Just the other day I went to the United Artists theater to see a weekend screening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. I found it intriguing that so many millions have been made in ticket sales for what is essentially a mediocre film.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter is the mainstay of this latest rendition of a story that has been stretched taut a long time ago. That they have been able to breathe new life into a 7th version of this claptrap is quite astounding.<br/><br/>Harry Potter #7 offers nothing new and its 2 hours + running time could be better spent enjoying Russel Crowe's Next Three Days or even Skyline. If it's value for money you're after then this is a little shy of the mark.<br/><br/>It's much ado about nothing really. Harry and co are searching for a magical sword and some funky amulets that need to be destroyed. That's it. The special effects are hardly noteworthy and this reviewer is already bored at having to do a write-up on this title."
"stephen-chalmers","6","3","6","28 November 2010"," Quiet and boring in places.
","This seventh of the Harry Potter books transferred to the big screen continued the darker and more grown up phase of the development of the story. Unfotunately Harry Potter has been on the go for so long now with such long breaks between film instalments of the book that there is a feeling that it is being deliberately spun out just to keep the revenue stream for as long as possible. Harry Potter was unique and wonderful when it first appeared but I feel it is past its sell by date and remembering how it all started is a dim and distant memory. This episode has nothing to do with Hogworts School, the young (actually not so young now) wizards have left school and are seeking to destroy things called horcruxes which will in turn destroy the power of the dark lord Voldemort. This episode in the long epic story sees the final book being split into two parts, so we'll have to wait yet another year for the concluding part! There were long boring parts in which very little happened - the silent parts in a busy auditorium resulted in hearing all the distracting sounds of sweet papers rustling, people talking and other distractions which normal film sound tracks would have masked. Cannot help but feel the movie makers are deliberately spinning this out and much of this episode could easily have been condensed without losing the plot. Having said that it did contain much of the HP wizardry and the unique JK Rowling formula that has created the Harry Potter phenomenon over the last decade. I think it should really have run its course by now however."
"saarvardi","4","3","6","27 November 2010"," A big spit in the face
","Judging by the trailers and the build up throughout the past 9 year and 6 movies, I was expecting HP7a to be a grand finale with a big showdown between Harry and Voldermort. Instead I got Harry and Hermione zapping from one place to another with seemingly no purpose, little to nearly none plot or character development, etc. Also, there were yet more questions asked (instead of the kind of answers you'd like to find in a penultimate film of a very long franchise), and - to top it all - major characters died off-screen (who does that?), and again, I didn't really see what point this served.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I felt like the ending was a big spit in my face as a fan. Instead of dragging the damn thing and filling it with unnecessary gloomy stares courtesy of Harry, Hermione and Ron, they could have at least sneaked in one big action sequence that'll satisfy the audience. Why not give us some answers about these Horocrux's? Why not arrange a mini-meeting between the lead protagonist and the villain, like we've been promised in the trailer? Instead, the film just ended suddenly, abruptly, courtesy of the greedy suits in Hollywood. Thanks a lot. Not."
"clay_animator","5","3","6","22 November 2010"," It really comes down to one issue.
","For the most part, this was a pretty good movie. The atmosphere was good, there are some really good scenes at the beginning and the end including a great piece of animation for the story of the deathly hallows.<br/><br/>The only real issue was the pacing, and it was a big one. The middle of this movie slows to a crawl as the characters spend a great deal of time doing pretty much nothing.<br/><br/>I'm reasonably convinced that there is no artistic reason why Deathly Hallows needed to be two movies. They've converted longer Harry Potter books into movies just fine. The fact of the matter is, this was done so the studio can sell you two tickets and I think the actual movie suffers as a result.<br/><br/>But of course, if you're a fan of the series, then you've seen this movie already. But for the rest of you, this is probably the weakest in the series, second two the Prisoner of Azkaban which is a movie that doesn't really work for no clear reason."

","I saw Harry Potter last night, and I have to say that I was extremely impressed. Splitting the movie into two parts was the best decision that could have been made for the seventh book. They fit in so many important parts and they were able to be extremely detailed in the story line. At first I was skeptical because the first half of the book was a good read, but sounded very difficult to portray on screen. I mean, who wants to watch them wander around lost with no idea of where they are going for the whole movie? Somehow Yates pulled it off. I was glued to the screen for the whole 2 hrs and 20 minutes of the film. I thought the acting was superb, the sets were AMAZING (Malfoy's Manor being a highlight in my mind), and the music did a great job in adding to the emotions of the characters. (The ending with Dobby comes to mind). This is definitely the best piece of work they could have done, as far as staying true to the book."

Dobby makes his return and what a return it was! Possibly the best thing about this movie was dobby everyone was cheering him on , a very well scripted CGI character that warmed everyone in the theaters heart.<br/><br/>All in all i hope part II is better if its not , they have brutally killed off a film genre of its own as well as the many young hearts who have followed it.<br/><br/>Was nice enjoying the film with my sister though :)"

","I saw this at the Sydney premiere and was highly impressed, Yates has done a terrific job here after the let downs of the last two films.<br/><br/>Now I've just read some reviews and there are many complaints about it being too long, action-less and boring. I must protest. One of the brilliant things about splitting the story into two films is to give each the time to fill out more than just non-stop action. <br/><br/>The acting here is much better than previously, with much of the story conveyed without the cramped, emotionless, talk-too-fast dialog of the other films. the characters are given the time to be still, to fill the emotional space around them and create a strong sense of the lost and crumbling world they are feeling their lonely way through. The three mains especially give fulfilling and nuanced performances, backed up by a strong show elsewhere. <br/><br/>Whilst everyone has their own tastes in films, I think some people need to let the films grow out of action-film-for-young-teen land and turn into the young adult drama the books ended up becoming. <br/><br/>This is a highly entertaining watch, but - somewhat redundant of this post - everyone who's seen the other films will watch this one even if it was horrible, and I can't see many people starting with this one even if it's brilliant. Harry Potter is coming to a fitting and spectacular close - but only for those that have been with him along."

","Whenever a Harry Potter book is converted into a movie (the name is enough to cast the magical spell on you even if you've not read any of Potter Books), the fans always have apprehensions. Read more to know why! As Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger prepare for their final showdown with Lord Voldemort and his brood of baddies ‚Äì which is stretched out to two chapters for the big screen ‚Äì we're thrust into an overcast world of fear, isolation and constant tent pitching in ""The Deathly Hallows.""<br/><br/>The first thing the viewer does is to compare the movie with the book. The novel fan expects every chapter of the book in a detailed manner in the movie. And if, by this late date, you're not well-acquainted with Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Voldemort, the late Dumbledore or even horcruxes, you're out of luck. Deathly Hallows drops viewers into the bleak proceedings straight away.<br/><br/>Lord Voldemort's death eaters are on a march. Major characters in the series are killed off, and there's not a moment to mourn. The war between the good wizards and those evil wizards and traitors in the service of Voldemort has begun. In no time, Harry, Ron and Hermione are on their own, away from Hogwarts and any safety older wizards may be able to give them. Seeing all this, Harry decides to break away from his protection. He sets out with Hermione and Ron on a mission to find the rest of the horcruxes and ultimately destroy them.<br/><br/>The visuals are grandeur. The trio has performed well. They have matured over the period of time and the maturity in their acting is clearly visible. Ralph Fiennes as the Dark Lord is awesome. His cold expressions are terrifying. But, there is one problem with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Long stretches of the movie are set in this or that remote landscape. The audience (especially who are not familiar with the novel) gets no idea of what is happening in the movie many a times. They could only make guesses!<br/><br/>Direction is good. Cinematography is awesome. Effects are outstanding. Acting is terrific. Editing is poor. Very poor. So is Screenplay writing. The writers could easily have done a much better job. The movie has a very little to offer in two hours and twenty-six minutes. Undoubtedly, The Goblet of Fire was the best among all. <br/><br/>To conclude, I would just go for it( to those who haven't read the book) to enjoy the last part of the series and the visuals!<br/><br/>My Rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Thanks & Regards"

","I have a hard time believing that Yates and the producers/screenwriter behind this will be able to salvage HP 7.2 after what I just saw in HP 7.1, basically too much muggle, too little magical, too much profit motive (cutting actors, cutting scenes, cutting transitions), too little attention to details and the story plot upfront during production (probably to keep costs down).<br/><br/>Furthermore, too many of Rowling's somewhat intricate, yet highly logical story threads have to merge in HP 7.2 for the ending to make any sense, unless plans are to change the ending itself, which will make a mockery of Rowling's masterpiece. (I doubt if she's had any ""creative control"" over HP since she signed over the film rights. It shows. But does she care?).<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: Harry's unique invisibility cloak ""vanishes"" again (like at the end of HP 6), which if carried over to HP 7.2 will entail a major rewrite of events. I didn't know that Death Eaters and Voldemort could fly without brooms, unless the brooms are hidden behind the black smoke FX. Dementors cut. Petronuses shakily rendered or cut entirely. Krum cut.<br/><br/>And once again, everything murky, with a washed-out dull look, as if shot through a dirty, grime-covered lens, as if the director/cinematographer had one of Voldemort's horcruxes dangling around his/their neck, affecting their minds, with darkness being projected, almost no light or vibrant colors as contrast, to highlight the innocence (light, love, non-murderous, merciful) versus evil (darkness, hate, murder, mercilessness) theme of the HP books.<br/><br/>It will take a miracle (or some powerful magic) to save HP 7.2 from being a disjointed repeat of HP 7.1. Only the heavy use of flashbacks will help the audience understand Rowling's grand finale, connecting the dots, as it were, because of all the cuts already made, for brevity and to increase profits. How will Yates and company wrap it all up? Will they continue to turn the magical into the mundane of their muggle way of thinking, turning HP into just another ""campy"" soap opera? I'm curious. I will be seeing HP 7.2 next year, therefore, just to see how Yates and company tie together all the loose ends (or not). Otherwise, I'm sticking with the vivid images invoked by Rowling's excellent story, with her entirely-logical sequence of events based on her consistent magical world rules, with lightness offsetting darkness and darkness offsetting lightness, but with lightness, and love, and innocence, and kindness, and friendship winning in the end."

The acting was amazing in this movie and I actually felt like this was the best in the series since the third one. I also remember having a boner over Hermione in her red dress in the wedding. Sorry for that TMI moment"
"ilovesharrypotter","10","2","4","6 July 2011"," Another absolutely brilliant Harry Potter movie!
","Deathly Hallows Part 1 was darker and more thrilling than the others and the acting once again was brilliant. Voldemort and the Death Eaters are more involved in this movie which makes it even more darker and thrilling. I think that this movie is one of the best HP movies made because of the drama type storyline eg. Horcruxes, being on the run etc. The music in the movie is slightly different too, for example right at the beginning of the movie when the Warner Brothers logo appears, the music is low and feels more intense.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent movie and a fantastic lead up to Part 2 (which should be epic!!!)"

","Being a die-hard Potter fan previously (though I must admit there has been too much time gap between my Potter-craziness and now), I must say now emphatically, the Potter movie franchise has gone nuts. HP 7.1 is not only the worst movie of the series, but also definitely one of the horrible movies I have ever seen. Potter fans have never found to claim that any of the movies has made justice to its book, but never have I imagined in my wildest dream that I would yawn during a Potter movie - thrice, yes, I distinctly remember, thrice . Two or three times I felt like leaving the theatre swearing at the creators.<br/><br/>I was little angry with Rowling for the 7th part, which I felt fell much shorter than my expectations. Now HP 7.1 version of the movie, reminded me of the frustration.<br/><br/>Now the rest of my post will contain some swear words (censored!!!) $%#&$$%%^^ %&^% %#$#$ 6$$%^%&^*%%%%$#%$#@##@@$^&"

","in every scene there's always too much space between everything(quite literally)why? everything is so organised, choreographed and fake. on top of the crap cgi(everything had to be British based) the acting is so unreal. Ralph Fiennes from the way he looks to the way he talks is just dreadful to watch. just like watching a cheesy horror flick. i am a fan of the books, and i don't mind that it's got a different story, but still 200-250mil budget even i could have done a better job. this movie should have included the Dursleys departure scene. it was just so dramatic. why is Hermione dancing with harry? it doesn't make any sense. all in all, just a soulless movie, filled with crap special effects and the worst acting from all the films. if you seen it cinema don't buy it on DVD, its not worth it"

"Red_Identity","Null","2","4","4 December 2010"," A Superb and Stunning Chapter
","The Harry Potter series is one of the most faithful I have ever seen, and each film brings something new. Whenever a new film comes out, there is always a certain criticism that a book fan will mention because of certain information or details left out of the film adaptation. Being the final book in the famous wizard series, this would always be the hardest book to adapt, so I was very relieved when it was announced that it would be split into two parts. Some might see this as an attempt to cash in money, but I honestly do not believe it was for that reason. The filmmakers care about this story, and being the finale, they care about adding in character development before the big action-packed finale. So after seeing Part 1, I have the obligation not just to judge it as a film adaptation but also as a film.<br/><br/>The opening of the film is perfect for the type of tone it is trying to set. Showing us each of the home lives of the three leads and just how difficult the future will be is a hard fact to behold. The action scenes in the film are pretty impressive, but not overly done and they do not take you out of the real story. David Yates and Steve Kloves have set Part 1 as a character film with action in it, not the other way around. And so it is with the rest of the film. Last Year's Half-Blood Prince proved to me that Yates was the best director that this series ever had. He understands mood and the challenges that the three leads are going through. Part 1 is able to capitalize on that.<br/><br/>Each new Harry Potter film is deemed as 'darker' than the previous, and that may be true, but it is not just about how sinister things on screen appear to be. The magical world is at a time where danger lurks around everywhere. We certainly are able to see this on screen, but the real power and the real confrontation as to just how dangerous the world is right now is brought by the quiet moments in the film. Many have said that the middle section of the film, when the three leads begin their camp out, is what weakens the pace. I was surprised by how much this was not true when I watched it. If anything, this section is much needed. It is also powerful because the three leads are able to hold their own very well. Over the years, they have matured and grown as actors, and at this point no one else could do what they are doing. There are certain scenes in the film that, while definitely subtle, are completely powerful and strengthen the characters and express the way they are feeling in a sense of loss. An example is the dance scene between Harry and Hermione, which I thought was perfectly acted by both, especially Watson. <br/><br/>Emma Watson has been the most inconsistent throughout the series. She was good as a little kid in the first two, good as a growing teen in the 3rd film, over-dramatic in Goblet of Fire, OK in Order of the Phoenix, and it wasn't until Half-Blood Prince when you could see she was really starting to shine. Well, here she does. While Radcliffe and Grint are very good, there is something electrifying about Watson. People have raved a lot about her performance, and while at times one is cautious not to overpraise a performance, she deserves it. She does not have scenes where in script it would seem as if she has to do something incredible. This is what makes her stand-out in this film. Starting from her first scene in the film, in a very sad and tragic scene in her home, we see her pain and her sadness over to what she has to do. She only has two words that she speaks in this scene, but her facial expressions say it all. She conveys the same powerful subtle expressions throughout the film. There is also another scene involving her and Helena Bonham Carter that she has been praised about, and this was a disappointment. Not that Watson wasn't great, because she certainly was, much more than what was probably required from her, but the scene only lingered on her for short seconds and then it cut away. We could hear Watson's incredible suffering, but I just wish it could have lingered more on her, to feel even more of what she and others like her really have to go through. Watson is incredibly effective and subtle in this film, and for the first time, she gave the best performance in a Harry Potter film, a feat that none of the three leads have ever achieved. <br/><br/>A real stand-out of the last HP film, Half Blood Prince, was the cinematography, and while I am not sure whether Part 1 was better shot than that one, it was still pretty impressive. Of course, that is no surprise. The music score also stood-out for me. While it is true that it is not as loud, or even as recurring, as the scores of the last Harry Potter films as in it is not present in a lot of the film, it was still effective. I really hope it gets some nominations. Ultimately, the film was everything I could hope for, and not any major flaws really appeared. The ending I also thought was a good way to end Part 1, contrary to the opinions of most. This was a very effective, carefully paced, and superb beginning to the end."

","Alright,I have to admit I'm a book fiend who cannot help comparing the movies and the books. I try really, but usually end up complaining about the characters, the changes, the actors and so on. This one however,is just plain FANTASTIC. I was just completely absorbed while watching and for once it did the book justice. The has been book molded into the film so well with the humour, the effects even along the changes I usually get annoyed about. David Yates did a good job! Oh Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson (especially her!)and Rupert Grint were were excellent. I do hope the second part will be like this. Just watch it."
"chelano","7","2","4","2 December 2010"," Only one more to go
","It is hard to rate and review these movies after awhile. There are so many and some I loved while others I didn't. One thing is that every new movie there is something different they try and it either wins or fails. This movie had both. The win was focusing on the main characters more as grown ups than as kids and it really worked. I felt like I was watching more of an adult fantasy type movie. The fail was the use of action scenes. They tried the whole, ""shaking the camera"" to add special effect and more of the real to the action shots. This really took away from the film and even started giving me a headache. I am glad it was not in 3D because I probably would of passed out. The cast was still great and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson blossom with each movie. The rest of the characters are fun to watch as always and a joy to see act. This film is darker than most of the other movies and did have some more passion towards characters too. So I did enjoy how it was filmed, but not the shaking camera. One more Harry Potter to go and it is over. Hopefully it will end and it will be a good end to a great series and everyone can focus on something new."
"Original_Fire","9","2","4","1 December 2010"," Amazing Dark Sequel.
","It's a good start to the epic finale. The whole film is dark and gritty, filled with death, violence, and suspense. At the very beginning, the trio were young and unskilled. They never been to such dangerous situations before. Each year passed, they were getting closer to death as they fight for their lives. They survived some unimaginable battles, witnessed shocking things, and learned such dangerous spells in order to defend themselves against the dark art. Now they are ready to fight.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is one of them. First year, he learned about a powerful stone and met a murderer of his deceased parents for the first time. Second year, he learned the dark lord's true identity and the truth behind the incident at Hogwart. Third year, he found out about the dark lord's plan in the past and the betrayal between those who are connected to his parents. Fourth year, he survived three dangerous tasks at such a young age and witnessed the return of the dark lord. Fifth year, he joined the rebellion and tried to convince everyone that dark lord's return is true until the end they saw him with their own eyes. Sixth year, he learned about the dark lord's past and how to defeat him for good. And now, he has a quest from Professor Dumbledore: Search for the rest of the dark objects made by the dark lord and destroy them. But he is not going alone. He is with his friends. They must complete the quest and stop the dark lord once and for all in the final chapter of Harry Potter franchise.<br/><br/>About the film, everything in there are pretty much what I expected from the book. Few character's death are sad. A couple of them gave me goosebumps. One of the scenes made me jump which is a giant snake, Nagini, suddenly popping out of the staircase as if it's coming at you. That one got me. The whole sequence of Godric's Hollow is creepy, especially the creepy old lady named Bathilda Bagshot sneaking around. lol Action scenes are amazingly good. The animation of three brothers is stunning, reminds me of Tim Burton's artwork. I'm bit disappointed that a few good scenes were cut. Even though some good parts from the book were not included in the film. Well, that's okay. I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave it 9 out of 10. Amazing. Stunning. Mesmerizing. Almost perfect.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for the second part. Bring it on July!"
"ANGEL-S","2","2","4","1 December 2010"," Book vs Movie
","Book wins! First, as an introduction to this review, I've seen all the HP movies up to date and read books 1,5,6 and 7. I am a fan of the series, but I am trying to stay above blind influence.<br/><br/>When I first heard for a fact that the last movie will be split into 2 projections, I was worried because of the bad experience with the Matrix, where people who for the first time watched Reloaded felt empty and cheated, because of the incomplete and apparently random story. Only later, while watching on DVD I learned to appreciate M2&3 more, but that was years after. Simply, I think this is a very bad practice for Hollywood, since public expects completed project from a theater - not a TV Series with a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>As I stated before, I have not read all the books, but from what I did, this is by far the most deviated version from the originals so far. First sequel is by far the most verbatim text-to-screen translation and with that respect, Deathly Hollows is the worst. From the very start we have some changes and shortcuts presented, some of them are good, others are pretty bad and didn't help to characters development. First mistake is the wedding scene, where we get so little time to explore all the wonders, there is no secret talks in the house between the actors, the scene between Harry Potter and his girlfriend is completely non-subtle and so on.<br/><br/>Timing. Simply, a viewer does not get a proper sense of time with this movie, and I believe this is critical since this helps viewer orientation to familiarize with the fantasy world. To put a plastic example, the scene where Ron leaves, and later shows up from nowhere lasts like 5 minute difference. Yet, Hermione says to Ron he was gone for weeks! Time is strictly non-linear, some of the scenes are so fast, others pretty much slow, but there are no pointers (via music and scenes fadeins-fadeouts for example) to accentuate those events.<br/><br/>Emotions. Are there really any emotions in this movie? Main actors are flat, really flat (they topped Severus character in coldness) and non-interested in comparison to previous sequels. The chemistry is missing.<br/><br/>But, to be realistic and fair, and put it easier to the actors who portrays the main characters, they are (in present) passing from a childhood to adulthood that bares its own weight, so it wasn't easy for them to get back into this fantasy world as easily as before. In fact, this could be very confusing for them personally (just put yourself in their shoe for a moment.) That is why I think the weight of this sequel should be balanced to other characters more as it was done to a point in the book.<br/><br/>Last, the culmination of the film when the group is captured by the Snatchers was simply not strong enough. I remember while reading the book that was one of the most scariest part (and thought like 'oh, my God, now they are finished!' 'It's over!' and so on.) That is missing from the movie. The scene in the house was simply too short.<br/><br/>In the end, when it comes to best part in the movie, which obviously I haven't enjoyed much, lets say it was the appearance of Dobby elf. Edit: and I almost forgot the three brothers story!<br/><br/>To be completely honest, the last HP book itself is not without problems either, it is much harder than previous sequels for a screen translation. Mainly, because it is full of internal characters drama which is extremely hard (or impossible) to translate on the screen. This is why I believe the movie could be done in a more deep, better technique either by using narration or at least internal thoughts (talking to self) of main character - Harry. His doubts if he is 'the one', connections (dreams, visions) with Valdemort and so on.<br/><br/>I am not feeling comfortable to say next line - but in the end this turns out at the present moment only as a new cash-cow for the studio, since the movie could be obviously 'glued' together in a 3-hour event with better time-management. Future will say whether I was wrong when the sequels gets out and dust setlles down."
"solon-stewart","4","2","4","30 November 2010"," Rip Off of ""Lord Of The Rings""
","I never read any of the books and have seen about half the movies. I went to the movie expecting it to be pretty good and enjoyable. Instead, I just found myself getting upset. J.K. Rowling just totally rips off of the Legend himself, J.R.R. Tolkien. Even down to the Initial first names.<br/><br/>""We have to leave now. We can't bring the others with us. Just the 'original 3 people. We can't trust the others"" (Sound a lot like Samwise and Frodo ditching the rest of the fellowship)<br/><br/>""A locket that cannot be broken. It must be broken to destroy the evil guy. Whenever you wear the locket it makes you irritable, mad, and say things you don't want to"" (Ring) Really?!?!<br/><br/>And near the end, ""The one wand that is more powerful than any other wand. One Wand to Rule them all"" (Ring)<br/><br/>What a lame rip off. And this is after i had heard for year about how creative Ms. Rowling is. How she invented this amazing world. I have listened to dozens of people drone on about how original her magical world was. Seems to me she realized she was a bad author, decided to change her name to mimic the master, and then bite off his masterpiece. A waste of 3 hours and 10 bucks I wish i could get back. No more for this plagiarist. Harry Potter Sucks"
"pushkar2016","5","2","4","29 November 2010"," Special Effects special
","Well, when the rating showed 8.1/10 then my reaction was are you kidding me? What the movie has got only special effects and nothing else. The acting is nothing but average. The plot is not continuous - nothing happens for an hour and everything happens in 5 min. Then why the hell make a movie of utter rubbish for 165 min. And finally the dialogues, well I have seen better in B-grade movies. Only one thing I want to add and well, it is a request (or to put it strongly a demand from an irate movie lover) - can I have my money back please? Or rather pay me for going through such a disastrous ordeal! Definitely not looking forward to part 7.2."

","I'm going to be be honest im not a big harry potter fan, although i did enjoy some of the previous films, However i did not enjoy the deathly hallows at all. While the other film felt original this felt like i was actually watching lord of the rings with harry potter characters. It felt very rushed and had a fast pace which the others didn't have. Many Characters would either only briefly appear in the film some not at all and other were only mentioned in dialog. I have to really question the originality of the story harry having to travel with companions to destroy the horcrux's to defeat the dark lord.... wait where do i know that from ohhhh that's right frodo had to travel to mount doom and destroy the ring to defeat the dark lord, i knew that sounded familiar. Maybe you have to be a harry potter fan to enjoy this film but either way it is the worst out of all of them, but anythings better than twilight!"
"Supachewy","5","2","4","27 November 2010"," One of the Weakest of the Series
","The fantasy film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is directed by David Yates and stars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint. The film takes place all over the wizarding world.<br/><br/>In the first part of the final chapter of the hit series Harry Potter (Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Watson), and Ron Weasley (Grint) are trying to form a plan with the group known as the Order of the Phoenix to overcome Lord Voldemort (Fiennes) and the rest of the death eaters. When the group is attacked by the death eaters they find themselves on the run while trying to find the horcruxes which can be used to destroy Lord Voldemort. Tensions grow between the three teens while they are searching for the horcruxes. Will they find all the horcruxes and make the wizarding world safe? You won't find out in this one but you will in the next one.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Steve Kloves based on the world wide bestselling novels was poor because the film does not stand out on its own. I have not seen the last Harry Potter film since it was in theatres so I don't really remember all the details. But besides that it was a pretty basic film plot wise. Wizards attacked, on the run and in hiding, search for objects to destroy evil, get attacked along the way, and then get ready for the sequel. Now let me just say right now that I have not read the books and I'm not a die-hard fan of the series so don't hate me forever because I am writing a negative review about this film. Most great sequels or even decent sequels someone can go in and watch and enjoy without seeing the earlier films. If we look to this summer's Toy Story 3 it was a very good film that you did not really need to see the other films to enjoy it.<br/><br/>David Yates direction on the other hand was pretty good. He had some very nice shots the whole way through, I can see him in the future on a different project getting some Oscar attention. I really liked the way he opened the film with a close up on the minister of magic's eyes and then all the cameras flashing taking a picture of him. Also, when Hermione was telling the legend of the three brothers I liked how he switched a Corpse Bride like animation technique, it was very effective and interesting. It reminded me a little of how a character in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 was telling a story and Tarantino decided to make it animated. Yates didn't get the greatest performances from his actors though.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was mediocre, even though some supporting characters were able to give a nice performance. All three leads, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, did a decent job but nothing that will make me believe that they will remain stars after the series come to an end. The only one of the three that I think has a chance is Emma Watson because she gives the best performance of them in all the films and Radcliffe and Grint have a very unique look that will only work for a limited selection of films. Everyone in this film who established their career from other films such as Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Brendan Gleeson, did a fine job with their very unique and in Carter and Gleeson's cases corky characters. I would have mentioned Alan Rickman as well but in this film his part only lasts around five minutes.<br/><br/>The score by Alexandre Desplat was great as it is in all of the Harry Potter films. It added another layer to what was happening on the screen allowing the audience to get deeper into the film. The classical melodies are always great and I personally like a film better when they decide to make their musical classical rather than a non orchestrated score.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 5/10. If I was to watch the first six films before this one than walk into the theatre I would have probably have given this a 6 or maybe even a 7. The main problem of this film is that it does not stand on its own unlike many great sequels over history such as The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Dark Knight, Toy Story 3, or any of the Lord of the Rings or Star Wars (original) sequels. I still recommend this film to Harry Potter fans and I hope that you enjoy it."

"jfcthejock","9","2","4","26 November 2010"," The Epic Finale That Harry Potter Yearned To Become, Now Follows The Epic Journey That Lord of The Rings Had
","Harry Potter personally has been an enjoyable series of films to date, however it lacked the epic scale and plot that up to the fifth film The Order of The Phoenix finally corrected. The fifth and sixth films of the series finally hit gold with the epic scale that brought back memories of The Lord of The Rings or the Star Wars prequel films. In part one of the final film, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione face off against the dark lord himself in a race to turn back the tide he has brought with him consuming the land.<br/><br/>In this finale, the scale of things has been lifted and no longer do we have a child like world that the first few films incorporated. From the start of this film, you know it has come a long way and matured into something more deeper and epic. No longer do our characters have a safety net to save them, at the final moment of the film and nor is there a quick fix present for them. Instead we have soul searching, character development and confessions being made that set the groundwork for part two.<br/><br/>Harry, Hermione and Ron have matured and grown into the characters we waited for them to become. Battle hardened, scarred warriors that have their flaws, but also their strengths that they will need to use against their enemies. This is also a film that will hit fans of the franchise hard, with many characters falling at the hands of the dark lord and will surely be missed.<br/><br/>The budget has also been raised for these two final instalments, and its obviously with the scale of locations, effects and plot-driven events. I feel that The Deathly Hallows has reached the epic level of Lord of The Rings, and even Star Wars. I think that the studio and director finally caught onto the success of The Half-Blood Prince with its dark theme and story, following on with the dark lord now taking over every foundation of the Wizarding world, our heroes are desperate, and at times turn on one another out of fear and desperation.<br/><br/>You feel these characters have grown and can now survive on their own, as they have to and have no one there to help them. This is a great start to the finale, and I cannot wait for the final part and hope the dark theme and epic scale continue."

","This is my first review for a Harry Potter movie, and its not because I didn't like the other ones, but this one touched me in a way that the other ones didn't. This one was very if not almost exactly like the book, which lately seems to be a problem for screenplay writers who butcher great books. <br/><br/>In the book you felt ever emotion the characters felt, and in the movie you could feel the despair and the sadness ten fold; you are literally with Harry, Hermione, and Ron. The pace of the movie made it brilliant, it lengthened the movie until you counln't stand it anymore,but it also made it aggravating. It kept you on the edge of your seat, waiting for what you know whats going to happen; or you simply waited with Harry and his friends in endless weeks of doing nothing,which was translated into the movie beautifully. The effects were phenomenal(as always).<br/><br/>Also the new characters were just perfect, the snatchers looked BADA@!#'s. Like rock stars. By far the beginning of the movie and the Ministry of Magic scene were the best! Stunning, my jaw was on the ground. So for all you Potter fans, you wont be disappointed, it is a brilliant movie and cannot wait for the second one."
"lewiskendell","7","2","4","25 November 2010"," As the end draws near...
","""The Ministry of Magic has fallen. The Minister is dead. They are coming.""<br/><br/>Even if you weren't familiar with the book that it's based on, you could tell from the very first few minutes of Deathly Hallows that we're speeding toward the final confrontation. The bleak, subdued settings, and the overall dark tone of the visuals and story portray a world in which Voldemort's victory is almost complete, and there is little comfort or hope to be found for our heroes and their allies. Death and danger constantly surround Harry, Hermione, and Ron, as they seek to complete the difficult task that they've been left by a mentor who can no longer guide them. They must stand alone, but the stresses of such an impossible journey makes even depending on each other harder than it's ever been before.¬†<br/><br/>The final Harry Potter book was a good one, but it isn't my favorite. Which is why this movie isn't my favorite of the series, either, despite the fact that I think David Yates did a phenomenal job of adapting it to the screen. The decision to make two full-length films from the final book was of course the correct one, as there's simple too much that would have had to have been left out or glossed over with a single film. There still had to be some things left on the cutting room floor, of course, but the absence of these minor scenes don't hurt the movie more than they have in previous installments. The way some events have been streamlined or altered is actually for the better, in my opinion.¬†<br/><br/>Now the wait begins for Part 2, and it's not made any easier with the knowledge of how well-executed Part 1 is. This was a movie of smart choices by the filmmakers, from the use of a hand-held camera to give the ""on-the-run"" plot a gritty, realistic intensity, to the way the story ends at the perfect point. Harry Potter is going out with a bang - as he deserves. The best compliment I can give Deathly Hallows Part 1 is that when it ended, I was a little disappointed that the movie was already over. Even after 2+ hours, I wanted to sit and continue on to the second part right then. Fans won't be disappointed."

The overall tone is full of foreboding, and rightly so - Voldemort is winning, well and truly, and Harry, the only hope for the forces of good, is forced on the run. This sense of foreboding is cemented right at the start by a short scene where Hermione wipes every trace of her own existence from her parents' life for their protection - a moment of such desperate sadness that it tells you how high the stakes are before anything else happens (just in case you had forgotten Dumbledore's death at the end of Half-Blood Prince).<br/><br/>There is a lot of action in this film, but not much story actually happens, and it doesn't have much of a plot of its own. This was one of the joys of the earlier books/films - each had a solid story and it wasn't until several volumes in that you came to appreciate that you were seeing episodes in a much larger story. Well, that larger story is approaching its climax, but rather slowly.<br/><br/>Having said that, the film always holds your attention, perhaps because there is some long overdue depth offered to the developing relationships between the three principals. Given that the three are thrown together for an extended sequence simply staying out of sight of Voldemort's faction, this perhaps inevitable. This sequence, which dragged quite badly in the novel, actually works well on screen, and Radcliffe, Watson and Grint all acquit themselves well. Again, one can hardly take one's eyes off Watson, and it is good to see Grint given a bit more to do than his usual comedy double takes while looking gormless.<br/><br/>In among the general darkness there are some genuinely creepy and upsetting moments, as well as a couple of moments which make you realise that these kids are now young adults.<br/><br/>Almost all previous surviving character cast members (with the notable exception of Maggie Smith) put in appearances, and I was struck by how perfectly cast these movies have been.<br/><br/>For a film which has, probably, less story than any of its predecessors, I enjoyed it more than most of them."

","The first part of the finale of Harry Potter is upon us and ""Epic"" seems to be the word the promotions of the film are calling it, and they may not be wrong.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed the previous Harry Potter films, especially the earlier few, but I really struggled to remember what had happened in the films prior to this one, apart from the events in the first two films the rest of the films seem like a blur all mashed together.<br/><br/>It's fair to say in my opinion the films have gradually got worse for me as they have gone on and I'm not sure if that's to do with me growing older as they've come out or if they really have been worse, but I was pleasantly surprised that Part One of the final film in the series does not follow this pattern.<br/><br/>The movie begins with everyone in the wizarding world and the real world not being safe, with Voldermort out to murder anyone who gets in his way in his attempt to kill Harry Potter.<br/><br/>From the moment the film starts Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the run and keep changing locations in order to keep Harry safe and continue in their quest to find and destroy the Horcruxes, an object used to obtain immortality, in order to defeat Voldermort, who's powers are growing stronger by the day.<br/><br/>Even though the films biggest action moments are only really a lot of running and spells flying at each other, it was definitely one of my favourite Harry Potter films, a lot better than the last one anyway.<br/><br/>It also does a brilliant job of getting you excited for the next and last instalment of the franchise, which will come out in cinemas next summer.<br/><br/>There were a few strange parts in the film that I'd like to mention. One bit when Harry and Hermione randomly start dancing to the radio, which was weird enough, but another bit when the Horcrux locket is opened and Voldermort's voice taunts Ron, it creates an illusion of Harry and Hermione making out¬Ö naked. I can understand the making out bit to make Ron angry and insecure, but why did they have to be naked. I just thought it was a bit weird and deserved to be mentioned that's all.<br/><br/>Anyway back on subject, if you like the Harry Potter films you should love this film. It's definitely one of my favourites of the seven movies so far and I'm eagerly anticipating the eighth and final movie of the Harry Potter series that will be showing in cinemas from 15th July 2011.<br/><br/>This review is taken from http://www.geoentertainment.co.uk/2010/11/harry-potter-and- the-deathly-hallows-part-1-review/"
"nrabond007","9","2","4","22 November 2010"," The grown-up Potter
","The brilliance that is the Harry Potter series has stood the test of time and already touched numerous generations, and still will for years to come. The movies themselves have ranged from merely average to great, as have their predecessors, the JK Rowling novels. Harry Potter was created to be a family experience through and through and has survived its fair share of criticism by pundits and religious nuts who make a stand against witchcraft and wizardry, although none of what is actually done in the novels and films should be taken literally, however, the movies and books carry an air of how lessons can be learned. Sorcerers stone taught us that love is the most powerful magic. Chamber taught us that what we believe in can be available to us. Azkaban showed us that nothing is ever what it seems. Goblet shows us that we can have camaraderie in intense competition despite our differences. Order shows us that we cannot overcome the harshness of reality without friends. Prince shows us that we need to always watch our backs, friends quickly become enemies.<br/><br/>DH1 covers all the morals of the first six films and puts them in a glorious mix of darkness. It has an ""Empire Strikes Back"" vibe as you feel that nothing is going to get better for our protagonists as time goes on. The darkness is welcomed, however, because it is done correctly, from the opening scene at Voldemort's Table, through the trials of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, adult and sexual in nature. This film is important and should not be missed. If you are expecting a happy ending, wait six months. Performances are masterful and effects are well beyond par. Highly Recommended."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","4","21 November 2010"," Darker, dramatic and more palpable ""Potter"" film is a true epic
","My how time flies. Not only have we watched three young actors and their respective characters grow up over the course of 10 years before our very eyes, but also the tonal shift from light to dark in the ""Harry Potter"" movies has been unusually drastic. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1‚Ä≥ is a true epic ‚Äî a dark and brooding journey with a tone remarkably akin to ""The Lord of the Rings."" Director David Yates has taken a film series which was once a fanciful, light-hearted rendering of author J.K. Rowling's imagination and made it feel real and especially dangerous. I suppose you could say it's not your older sibling's ""Harry Potter.""<br/><br/>The dark turn of the films was inevitable given the content of the books, but Yates has realized it in such a way that these last couple of films have felt completely different from their predecessors. Rowling's tone, in spite of more prolific deaths, has not changed nearly as much. This time around there's lots of blood, characters are dying left and right and the stuff that supplements the main plot, instead of being fluffy and magical, is decidedly dramatic.<br/><br/>Although Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is still the courageous and impulsive one, Hermione (Emma Watson) is still the smart and prepared one and Ron (Rupert Grint) is still the oblivious one, the dialogue is adult and the moments they share are complex. The three friends must survive on their own in this film as they search for the horcruxes (objects infused with parts of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul) and are on the run from the Death Eaters, the dark wizards and witches who have seized the Ministry of Magic and have begun a reign of terror. Considering these once-child stars were initially cast on looks and being able to play their type, they continue to prove themselves as venerable adults in ""Hallows.""<br/><br/>This maturity is reflected in the writing of screenwriter Steve Kloves (who adapted every book but ""Order of the Phoenix""). He provides many tender and dramatic moments between the friends, not all of which were written by J.K. Rowling, trusting them to handle the deeper material. Given the flexibility of a two-film final chapter, Kloves could also resort more to cutting corners than entire sections of the book. Devout fans will notice much of the exposition regarding Albus Dumbledore's ""mysterious"" past including that involving the wizard Gridelwald has been axed or turned into easter eggs. That's it as far as significant omissions, and it was the right choice on account of a lack of visual storytelling opportunities, even though Harry's growing resentment of/loss of faith in Dumbledore never becomes part of the story as it does so intriguingly in the book.<br/><br/>Yates' patience also improves the series in ""Hallows."" There's a build up to the events and some lengthier shots that have a lasting impact. It feels more like a dramatic motion picture than a squeeze-it-in adaptation. The film could have easily hopped from scene to scene with action at every turn, but Yates takes his time. The scene in Godric's Hollow, for example, when Harry and Hermione follow the old Bathilda Bagshot to her house only to find she's not quite who they think she is evolves slowly and culminates in a tense sequence lasting much shorter. Succinctly put, the cinematic quality of the films has continued to improve as it has done ever since Yates took over. What used to be the emphasis in the plot-driven scenes (action and visual effects) has changed.<br/><br/>""Deathly Hallows"" is not forgiving of those who aren't already familiar with the Harry Potter universe, but at the same time, this darker tone, higher proportion of drama and much more cinematic feel should improve the overall entertainment factor for those hoping to get something out of the ""Hallows"" despite never reading the books or barely remembering the previous entries.<br/><br/>With the PG-13 rating back on, ""Deathly Hallows"" feel real and the action is palpable. The casting of fighting spells back and forth in battle do some collateral damage for once. The sound and VFX teams deserve major credit for upping that factor to a new level. For once, magical realism has an application to the Potter world: Instead of calling attention to pretty visual effects, Yates and crew make them feel naturally part of the action, which keeps our focus on the characters. CGI in films has also improved over the 10 years of ""Potter"" movies and as such, Yates sees no compelling need to highlight them more than usual and ""Hallows"" is better for it.<br/><br/>Maybe most importantly, ""Hallows Pt. 1‚Ä≥ sets us up for a dramatic, exciting and cathartic finale to the most impressive movie franchise ever made. Yates, Kloves and the entire cast and crew have really upped the stakes with their work on this film and it shows. I have no ounce of doubt that Part 2 will be an incredible send-off for this series given the effort and creativity put into Part 1. If you're a fan who has forgotten how close you've actually become to these characters, ""Deathly Hallows"" will surely remind you."
"Astralan","7","2","4","21 November 2010"," On target, but unremarkable
","I was a little confused at the onset. I didn't know what to expect, but Yates does not hold much favor in my mind; so that said I will refrain from bashing on him. The story continues, but in a much more honest, sincere measure.<br/><br/>I felt the acting was much more polished, the emotional content much improved and the bond between the three primary characters solid in so many more ways than portrayed in earlier movies. You could feel that after a decade of working together, growing together, almost living together that their profession in acting has also grown similarly. I found my experience being drawn in to their drama, their pain and their bonding to all that they are connected. After a while you really didn't care who they chose to play what in this movie, but there were enough returning cast to put you back in that comfort zone that the Potter legacy will hold on to for generations to come.I got to hand it to them: They kept the group together for over 10 years. That alone is an amazing accomplishment.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised that this wasn't a hugely over involved CGI epic. It had its moments, and it was obvious at the first sight of Dobbie that life characteristics in a computer generated character have made them a bit more believable rather than just cartoonish. I didn't actually agree with the choice for Lovegood, it seems that a portly, stout or even fat person would have been more suited for this role, but again it was acceptable.<br/><br/>Again, much of this first part was acceptable, but not great. Some reviewer said this was a great prolonged trailer. I agree in many senses of that. There was a lot that could have happened in a shorter time. I felt the dialog, action, sequences were deliberately retarded to stretch and get as much out of this as possible. I'm not trying to be mean. I found the movie kept me engaged in a positive way. But when you can count 10 seconds between responsive dialog, I felt the stretch. The tragedy scenes were much better. The younger guy sitting in the seat next to me was balling his eyes out at the death of Dobbie (though it could have been to impress the pretty lady he was sitting next to.... OOH! Low Blow!). Yeah, I got misty eyed at a couple of spots. The handling of the finding of the sword and the reunion was exceptionally well conceived and filmed. The thing is, the film got most of the right things in at the right time with an acceptable amount of scenes cut out. Overall, people that groan and moan about this one are too calloused. On the other hand, those who praise it as a top notch film have probably been so used to being disappointed with Yates' productions that this one was his defining moment. It probably was, but that is not saying much."
"az-daniels","9","2","4","21 November 2010"," A Whole New Level.
","'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' exceeds all expectations, every Harry Potter movie keeps on getting better and better and this film is the current gem of the franchise. It also conveys a very important message at its heart, especially about fascism. We are reminded of all those years ago of when another dastardly figure had quite similar ideas to 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named'. From the very first gravely words spoken by Bill Nighy: ""These are dark times, there's no denying"", we know that we are in for a 'treat'.<br/><br/>Brilliantly directed by David Yates (who has had the honour of directing the franchise since 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix') 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is the beginning of the end of an epic adventure and it satisfies its audience with drama, action and some incredibly moving scenes (especially the final act). This 'Harry Potter' is nothing like the previous films, it is darker, more serious and there is the worrying phenomenon of sexual maturity for Harry, Ron and Hermione. The professional use of CGI and breathtakingly beautiful scenes also add to the greatness of the film, I just loved the way that they designed the Malfoy Manor. All of these factors make the whole film an exhilarating ride.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all brilliant, it is amazing to see how much they have grown up and how their acting skills have flourished over the years, they have grown from children to young adults ‚Äì they carry the series with their professional acting. Other famous faces (who are mostly very talented veteran British actors) must not be forgotten, such as Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Robbie Coltrane, Brendan Gleeson, Alan Rickman, John Hurt, Rhys Ifans, Jason Isaacs, David Thewlis, Julie Walters and many more who have had the honour of appearing in this iconic franchise.<br/><br/>However, a special mention must go to the screenwriter: Steve Kloves, who adds a lot of gloom at various points but then surprises us with light humour, which is effectively crafted in a way that it doesn't really distract the viewer from what the grim reality of the situations that Harry, Ron and Hermione are in. Kloves sure knows how to adapt a book into a film and he hasn't made a single mistake with 'Deathly Hallows Pt. 1'.<br/><br/>What I was most pleased about 'Deathly Hallows Pt. 1' was the fact that it wasn't in 3D ‚Äì for this format would have entirely ruined the film for me because like some other films which were originally supposed to be in 2D but had 3D incorporated to it in the post-production stage, it would have lowered the brightness and clarity. It is a shame that part. 2 will be in 3D and I fear that it will suffer in brightness and clarity, but let's hope that the traditional Warner Brothers will decide to change their mind like they did with part. 1.<br/><br/>4 ¬Ω out of 5 (exceptional) ‚Äì The best Harry Potter to date, and I am sure that this statement will change when part. 2 is released."
"russ-903-575243","10","2","4","21 November 2010"," GREAT Movie
","I was thoroughly excited at a new film despite the fact that the last 3 instalments of the series were, at best, disappointments. Potter fans want Potter films of the book. The apparent Hollywood imperative of making movies somewhat different from the books has pervaded the last attempts at adaptation of J.K. Rowlings masterpieces. The last one was mostly a love story between Ron and Hermione, which was, at best, a sideline of the books. Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that most books, if truly transferred to film, would likely result in exceedingly long movies, movies such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" managed it quite nicely. It is clear that there are going to be things left out. But one would imagine that writers and directors would be somewhat more careful in the surgery than they had been with ""Goblet of Fire"", ""Half-Blood Prince"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"". I walked into the theatre with anticipation. I walked out satisfied. The reality is that they did have to cut things out. There likely could have been a few more minutes added to keep some of the cuts in, though I suppose that everyone will have their own ideas as to what should have been put back. But the most important aspects of the story and books remained in the movie. There were lots of smiles, lots of laughs and lots of jumps too. The villains were villainous, the heroes heroic. Harry Potter fans will know precisely what is going on. Those who have not read the books may be confused or unable to follow what is happening or why. But, as a Harry Potter fan, I enjoyed it immensely. It was, in my view, far better than several of the previous instalments and is at least as good as the first two movies directed by Tim Burton. When J.K. Rowling says ""he got it"" when talking about the directors interpretation, I can finally think that she isn't just supporting the studio who has added to her fortune."
"StGaffer","7","2","4","21 November 2010"," A Good Start For A Film That Will End a Series
","I haven't felt a sadness like this since Star Wars Episode 3 and Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King came out, ending the much beloved Star Wars Franchise (movie-wise) and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.<br/><br/>With the first part of the last film of the Harry Potter Franchise, the end is indeed coming.<br/><br/>In the Deathly Hallow Pt.1, Harry and his friends, leave the safety and comfort Of Hogwarts, to the dangers of the outside world, in order to destroy Horcruxes, items that contain the soul of the enemy Lord Voldermort.<br/><br/>Visually, Director David Yates has been consistent (in his Harry Potter Movies) in his use of ""dark"" tints, a trend first used in the Harry Potter films by Alfonso Cuaron, in order to ""signify"" the change of tone from the childishness of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, to the darkness of Prisoner Of Azkaband. And a fair warning, this is not the same harry potter as HP 1. What differs, is Yate's uses of the hand held camera, or what I call the ""Jason-Bourne"" camera. The result is some gritty scenes, that are quite enjoyable, especially when magic is casted.<br/><br/>One Huge Difference Is the use of fantastic scenery, something that is a welcome change from the dull castle-like Hogwarts. One must congratulate JK Rowling for making Harry go out of Hogwarts in the books, the scenery is really breathtaking.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the three main actors have done a commendable job, with Emma showcasing a side that is different from the usual seen in the past movies. The same can be said about Rupert Grint. I still have some problems with Daniel Radcliffe, while he is a decent actor, I do feel he lacks a good presence, and some lines do come out as awkward. This can also be due to his lack of experience.<br/><br/>I do have some main gripes about the film.<br/><br/>One of them, but this is probably due to the books, is the Huge Cast. With fantastic talent such as Helena Bonham Carter,Imelda Staunton, the always excellent Alan Rickman and the reliable Bill Nighy, they just don't get enough screen time, and when they do appear, it is usually for a few seconds. For example, Alan Rickman and Clemence Poesy only has a few minutes of screen time. This can also annoy some fans who have an affinity with some characters, i for one enjoy both Snape and Lupin, both are hardly in the movie.<br/><br/>For Harry Potter Purists, some might recognise the cuts and modifications Yates has done in the movie. As a reader myself, the cuts of some scenes that I consider important gets really annoying (Whether scenes such as Snape's background and Dumbledoor's history are going to be shown in part 2 is left to be seen).<br/><br/>Yates has also included some ""funny"" moments, while some work, I feel some come out as awkward and just plain weird. Furthermore, the ""ending"" of part 1, didn't come out well. While it makes many people painfully wait for next year, it does give a feeling that the movie is randomly cut there, the effect makes it feel ""complete"" in a way.<br/><br/>Overall Deathly Hallow part 1 is a good start for the last film of the harry potter film series. While it does have some annoyances, it does it's job of giving a sense of ending."

The painting of Phineas Nigellus that they took from Grimauld Place was not in the movie and this is how Snape found out were the trio were to pass the sword of Gryffindor on to them which means that they will probably make up another reason for how he found them in part 2 2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ..... 3 hallows ""The wand - The Stone - The Invisibility Cloak"" There is absolutely no mention or scene with the invisibility cloak ....huge flaw in my opinion as the trio use it a lot in the book to help them travel and is a huge part of the story But overall this move is the best so far"

A rarity...in which state of the art special effects are actually complemented with solid effortless acting. No wonder...the cream of unmatched British thespians are in control of this franchise, which in any other case would have simply been a sterile FX romp. What a once in a lifetime opportunity for the film industry to pull of a success like this. It doesn't matter if the screenplay leaves out significant parts of the original book. The film stands firmly on its own merit. And what a feather in Warner's cap to have this one in its vaults. What creativity and film magic. It makes me want to drop everything and go to film school. There has been nothing remotely like this film. A masterpiece right out of the blue...like magic."
"Deadbob12344","8","2","4","19 November 2010"," Overall a good movie, despite the wait for the 2nd installment
","As most of the people have, I just returned from the theater and am writing my review. Now lets start out with what I thought was good about the film: 1.The acting is much better than previous movies, especially Emma Watson 2. This movie captures all major details of the book, only leaving very minor things out and changing a few 3.The movie is good at capturing your attention and definitely does not seem as long as the 140 minutes it runs 4. There isn't really anything that inappropriate in this movie, it is only PG-13 because of violence (which isn't even that bad) so you could bring your children if you wished 5. The action scenes are well done. Although sometimes they can be difficult to follow, they still include the suspense you want them to in order to elevate what happens next. And if you cant follow them...it's a book and movie that is largely based on action, why would you be watching it then? 6. Even if you're not the most die-hard Harry Potter fan, you should be able to follow along quite well without even having read the books. (Although I have read all of them, that part is coming from my numerous friends who also saw it) 7. It is difficult to make a movie based off of a book, because people always complain that people who haven't read the book can't follow along, or that people who have see that they've left out details, but with the plot of J.K Rowling combined with the directing of Yates, it works out nicely.<br/><br/>And, since every movie has them, the negatives. There aren't too many, and most of these are just minor things, but here they are anyway 1. This movie is long. As I said earlier it is appropriate for most audiences, but younger children,who are generally easier distracted, may get bored despite how interesting the movie is 2. Not really a complaint about the movie itself, but it is sold out almost everywhere, so you may not get to pick your seats. Now I can handle a movie from anywhere in the theater, but if you sit near the front row it may be quite painful to look straight up for 2 hours. And since it is such a large screen you may miss some of the action if you sit too close. But, as I said, this doesn't have anything to do with the actual movie 3. Now a lot of people complained about this and obviously I am going to also. The end is pretty good, they added some extra action to make it more exciting, but no matter how good the ending of a movie is, I doubt you can capture that suspense in your audience for 8 months. And the ending didn't really seem to excite me much, If you've read the book, then you know what is coming and it won't be as exciting.<br/><br/>4. Which leads me to my next complaint. Of course I have this one. 8 months? You have to wait that long for part two to come out? By that time most people will have forgotten a lot of what happened in the movie (especially if you didn't read the book) and you will probably have to watch it again on a DVD. Now technically 8 months isn't tooo long to wait, we've waited longer for sequels to movies just as popular, but if it is another part of the movie instead of a separate movie, that is kind of long. But I guess I would rather watch a movie that you had to wait for which is fully complete and good, than a movie that is 3 and a half hours long and so cramped that half of what happens in the book is left out. And this is the last book, so not exactly the time to be leaving out details.<br/><br/>Moral of the story? Despite my complaints and the wait, a good movie. Should entertain you for a good 2 hours, and no really major flaws. And besides, complaining about how long part 2 is going to take to come out doesn't have to actually do anything with part 1. So if you want to go see J.K Rowling's great novel in the form of a film, go to the theater...that is if it isn't sold out yet."

","going into this movie i thought well how will David Yates leave out of this movie. going along with leaving out so much in the half blood prince. I knew there would be more since it was made into 2 films. but wow this movie followed the book very well. Yes some parts were out of place and some stuff was left out but nothing that was really important and that i really wanted so see was absent. i do wish they would of gone more in-depth with the Dumbledore life story, but maybe that will be explained better in part 2. But by far this movie is Yates best to date it was great and had everything i was expecting and more. the movie also didn't move to fast. a lot of people feel it was strange sending the end of part one so deep in the story but I think it was the perfect ending to the first part. It was saying OK now the battle is going to beggin."
"helmutty","8","2","4","19 November 2010"," The best Harry Potter movie yet
","Surprisingly, this is more intense and action-packed than the previous movies. The previous movie, the half-blooded prince has literally no action, only some mild struggle of magic battles. The deadly Hallows is better than the last in terms of action and intensity. From start to the credit rolling, I had to hold my breath during the intense 2 hours and 26 minutes as I have not read the books; not knowing what could happen next. With the realistic acting, the high level of intensity is achieved.<br/><br/>The story: It starts off darkly with Voldemort displaying his cruelty without hesitation. And from that scene, you know you will be absorbed into the now dark and bleak world of Hogwart. Harry Potter and his friends are the run and nearly every where they stop for a rest or go into hiding, troubles find them. And that are the parts where David Yates proves that he can create some hectic action scenes. Though the action scenes are brief but they are intense like the first action scene where Harry had a narrow escape. The action scene in the forest is intense though frenetic. The story may drag a little in the middle but it has a purpose; to understand the trio's emotions more. The acting is good. The intensity between Daniel, Emma and Rupert is good and believable. The other characters' suspicious looks and capable of doing anything also make this intense. The special effects are breath-taking. Music score is also epic; the music matches the movie right and at the right time.<br/><br/>Overall: Is it the best Harry Potter movie? I can't say as the final movie is not out until next year. But this is definitely the best Potter movie so far as I feel that it balances the right amount of action and drama and intensity. I was left disappointed after watching the half-blooded prince but this is good follow-up where I didn't actually feel disappointed. One of the better blockbuster movie this year."

","Although the story is spread out across 2 films, significant changes have been made to give the film better flow. These rewrites are much appreciated and stay as true as they can to the books, however these efforts are undercut by some really shoddy editing and some questionable calls from the director.<br/><br/>This Harry Potter sequel is the most classically British, meaning most of the dialog has been replaced by meaningful looks held for far too long. One can't help but wonder why some scenes drag on forever while other bits were cut out entirely. There were a few points in the movie where I asked myself, ""Where did that come from? How did they get there?"" Of course I can figure it out and fill in the blanks with my own imagination, but HP-DH1 forces you to do it so often, the audience deserves an IMDb credit.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is very well done. It's clear Harry Potter was intended for 3D, but the missing technology isn't missed at all. The graphics and effects are great, even without the glasses. While there are a few very typical 3D shots, like panning across computer generated landscapes and things jumping at the camera, it avoids being distracting and even enhances the scenes in some cases.<br/><br/>The books get darker as Harry gets older and The Deathly Hallows Part I matches the intensity readers are expecting. There are moments of levity (and laughably ridiculous moments of bad acting and trying too hard), but for the most part the film maintains its serious tone throughout. Most of the Harry Potter films have felt like really long trailers for the next movie, but surprisingly Part I of II stands on it's own in a way the other films have not (except maybe the first one). You know a second part is coming, but a clear line has been drawn in the story and they're careful not to indicate TOO much.<br/><br/>Overall, The Deathly Hallows Part I is one of the better Harry Potter movies and fans of the book will surely love how this story is told on film. Be warned, however- may cause drowsiness. Kids could have a hard time getting through the whole thing with their eyes open."

So my review may be biased.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is basically a drag and a setup for the final film. People now have to watch this so they can understand what transpired before the final film. Instead of combining Part 1 & 2 for a larger finale, it was decided to squeeze the series for a bit more cash.<br/><br/>The end result of the above process is a film with a few interesting parts and a ton of filler. There's a lot of drag in this one that could have been cut out.<br/><br/>Of course, as usual with Potterverse films, there's action, comedy, etc. But this film awkwardly transitions from months at a time to days.

","Whilst I think they did the right thing in splitting Deathly Hallows into two movies, Part I was just unfortunate that it got the worse half. Like all Harry Potter movies, the story makes sense, there are little to no plot holes, it has great acting and a great story. As it is the first half of a book, the story is quite slow and dragged on compared to other HP movies and for that reason it suffers. The other thing that lets it down is by this point is that both one of the best HP characters Sirius and Dumbledore are dead, the absence of these two truly entertaining characters lets the film down a bit."

","The long goodbye for the most successful film series of the century thus far begins with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I,"" the darkest and least characteristic of the batch.<br/><br/>The long goodbye for the most successful film series of the century thus far begins with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, the darkest and least characteristic of the batch. Gone are Hogwarts and the sense of security that went with it, gone is any of the joy of youth, gone is more than just a measure or two of John Williams' original music. With Harry, Ron and Hermione left largely to their own devices on often forbidding terrain, this grim beginning-of-the-end odyssey has a very different feel from any of its predecessors -- a development slightly more disconcerting than it is welcome. That this holiday release will be a huge international attraction is beyond question, even if the real fireworks mostly await the finale's second installment, which arrives July 15.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most pertinent question surrounding the way in which J.K. Rowling's exceptionally intricate epic is being concluded onscreen is whether dividing the final book into two films was justified artistically or only financially. After all, the longest volume in the series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, became the shortest film, and parts of the long midsection of Deathly Hallows-- when the kids sulk in the wild, not knowing what to do next -- easily could have been abridged.<br/><br/>More than even the most faithful of the earlier episodes, this film feels devoted above all to reproducing the novel onscreen as closely as possible, an impulse that drags it toward ponderousness at times and rather sorely tests the abilities of the young actors to hold the screen entirely on their own, without being propped up by the ever-fabulous array of character actors the series offers.<br/><br/>Arguing in favor of the extensive treatment is the fact that in Deathly Hallows, screenwriter Steve Kloves must pull together multiple story strands and dozens of characters that, as especially will be the case in Part 2, date back to the series' prepubescent days. To cram the essentials covered in Part 1 and to do justice to the climaxes that await would represent a very tall order for a single conventional-length film. So it seems reasonable enough to say why not do it all, shoot the works, show every scene millions of readers want to see, give every character his or her proper curtain call, be expansive rather than constrained? In this case, probably better a bit too much -- even a dull scene here and there -- than not enough.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows opens boldly. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" intones Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy, just now joining the series) in intense close-up, acknowledging the fact that archvillian Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his Death Eaters, having dispatched Dumbledore at the end of the previous installment, are on the verge of a complete takeover. For his part, Voldemort has gathered his minions to stress that it falls to him and no one else to kill Harry Potter, who must be hunted down at once.<br/><br/>Knowing his peril, Harry moves his immediate family (providing brief encores for Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw and Harry Melling) out of Privet Drive. But, sensing danger, Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson, fun to have back) insists upon replicating Harry sevenfold so that the Death Eaters won't know which is the real one when they come after him -- which they promptly do in a spectacular nocturnal airborne chase that ends up at the Weasleys' isolated home for a furtive wedding.<br/><br/>As anyone who has followed the yarn in print or onscreen will know, Harry's only hope of stopping Voldemort lies in his finding and destroying the Horcruxes that represent portions of the Dark Lord's pestilential soul. Inscrutable clues have been left behind by Dumbledore, but an encounter with former house elves Kreacher and Dobby -- themselves not seen in some time -- reveals that one Horcrux is in the possession of the students' former tormenter, the pint-sized lady in pink, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).<br/><br/>The film's most engaging sustained interlude involves the kids' risky visit to the Ministry of Magic, where Umbridge works as a judge now that the goon squad has taken over. Transforming themselves physically into the bodies of minor wizards, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) sneak about in a bureaucracy strewn with posters branding Harry ""Undesirable #1"" and so rife with threat and fear that Dr. Goebbels himself would have approved.<br/><br/>Then follows the long spell in the wilderness, the bleakness of which is alleviated only by a small satchel of Hermione's that rivals that of Mary Poppins for its bottomlessness and by a dance to radio music that Harry and Hermione briefly enjoy after Ron bolts in a huff. The duration of this stretch, which sees the protagonists reach their lowest ebb of despair, might have been justified were the actors capable of suggesting more subtext and nuance to express the cumulative emotion of their long struggle. We get the idea, but there's not enough going on moment to moment to stymie the urge to fast-forward.<br/><br/>But once Ron returns and they're able to destroy the Horcrux, leaving three more to go, they visit their friend Luna Lovegood's haunted father Xenophilius (Rhys Ifans), the upshot of which is a beguiling animated sequence that illustrates -- not a moment too soon -- what the Deathly Hallows are.<br/><br/>The friends are eventually captured and hauled into Malfoy Manor, where the maniacal Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter, as entirely captivated by the role as ever) would gladly finish them all off if not for the constraints imposed by the Dark Lord. The ending is not exactly a cliffhanger but, rather, an unambiguous promise of escalated mayhem to come in July.<br/><br/>With two previous Potter episodes under his directorial belt, anointed series finisher David Yates certainly knows what's called for at this point but still doesn't betray a special knack for inspired screen fantasy; it's fair to say that, among Potter directors, he occupies a reliable, prosaic middle ground between the indulgent obviousness of Chris Columbus in the first two and the vibrant work of Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell on entries 3 and 4, respectively.<br/><br/>The marvelous technical wizardry on display can come as no surprise at this point; it seems to get better with each installment. Composer Alexandre Desplat makes his Potter debut with a turbulent, emotional score that borrows from the original theme-setting Williams only to musically identify Harry's owl Hedwig on its brief appearance.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding that Harry Potter is not even 18 years old when Deathly Hallows begins, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and especially Rupert Grint look very grown-up now, the series having taken nine years to make rather than the seven that elapse across the span of the story. Most of the prime supporting players are allowed only a scene or two here, and their comparative absence is felt; it can only be hoped that at least some of them will be afforded final moments to shine in the follow-up."

"HotToastyRag","7","0","0","19 June 2019"," A nice respite
","It's ironic that many have hailed this movie as boring, a waste of time, and a shameless moneymaker, when I actually enjoyed it for two of those reasons. In the recently dramatic Hogwarts years, with beloved characters dropping like flies, isn't it nice to be able to catch your breath and watch two teenagers wander around in the forest without anything bad happening to them? And really, who cares that you spent an extra seven dollars at the movie theaters-which was the ticket price in 2010-since you got to see characters you grew up with in a world you immersed yourself in the past nine years up on the big screen? It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, and since the movies preceding and following Part One are so heavy, a respite is welcome.<br/><br/>In this movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson decide to leave school and pursue the destruction of the great villain destroying all the good in the wizarding world. They're on the lookout for several magical objects that house part of Ralph Fiennes's power, but since the final book got split into two movies, it's a fair assumption that they don't accomplish their goal in this one. For most of the movie, the trio wanders around near the ocean, by the forest, and in their friends' houses. If that sounds incredibly boring, have no fear. Rupert becomes enormously moody and jealous, and he leaves their party of three. Dan and Emma continue to wander around by themselves, and as they're in very close quarters, they bond. Plenty of fans include their spontaneous dance as one of their favorite moments of the entire franchise. It's sweet, casual, and their chemistry lights up the screen like fireflies.<br/><br/>The movie isn't completely without drama, tears, or violence. After all, the teenagers are trying to save the wizarding world and take down an incredibly powerful and evil bad guy with no nose! I liked this one better than Part Two because many people make it out of this movie alive, and even though there are some sad bits, it's not overwhelmingly depressing. Also included in this one is a pretty cool animated sequence explaining the meaning of the title that feels simultaneously realistic and stylized."
"dineshaishu","7","0","0","21 May 2019"," Harry Potter and the deathly hallows: part 1
","In my mind, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along: gritty, emotional, and cinematic. I haven't been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date, but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the ""children's fantasy"" genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book: hopelessness and desperation.<br/><br/>After the death of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the magical world falls into disarray as Voldemort gains power over the Ministry of Magic and hunts tirelessly after his mortal enemy and our continuing protagonist, Harry Potter. While keeping a low cover, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine decide to track down and destroy Voldemort's soul contained in hidden ""horcruxes"" but have difficulties deciding what to do and where to start.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows very successfully portrays the despair-filled journey of the wizarding trio. With dark undertones running through the cinematography, Part 1 of the Harry Potter finale is the film that deals more with the emotional stagnation of the characters and spends less time with action scenes and major plot points. Since Rowling's seventh book is separated into two movies, Part 1 boasts a much slower pace than earlier HP films and is not so focused on cramming as many subplots and side-stories from the book as possible into the movie's runtime, which tends to clutter up the storyline and make the whole thing feel rushed.<br/><br/>But where the slow pacing makes this film stand out in the series, it also may be its downfall. The Deathly Hallows continually feeds us a feeling of desolation as Harry, Ron and Hermoine fail to discover a way to destroy the horcruxes; they seem to be making no progress towards defeating the Dark Lord, but as an effect the movie seems to be making no progress towards an ending. Storyline lags intensely towards the middle of the film and is dragged out until the conclusion (which ends abruptly). You'll be left in your seats feeling like this is going nowhere- but that's the point: Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are getting nowhere. So I liked this movie because the pace was slow, but I also didn't like this movie because the pace was slow. See what I'm getting at? Aside from that, I can't complain much. Performances were fine, effects were impressive, and best of all, nothing dastardly was done to J.K. Rowling's story.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a nice improvement and a fine addition to the Harry Potter series and should serve as a solid emotional base for Part 2 to take off with next year. If you've enjoyed the HP movies so far, this should be a satisfying experience at least. If not, let the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 redeem your faith in the series. 7/10<br/><br/>P.S. Keep on the lookout for the scene about the deathly hallows story. It has some of the most beautiful and artistic animation I have ever seen in a movie."

","11 December 2010. This beginning of the end for the Harry Potter series is a disappointment and apparently without the book the movie is unable to stand alone as a movie and instead becomes a disjointed, disconnected series of movie scenes that initially begins with fusion between a TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991) action thriller and a junior version of BRAZIL (1985) and a retro-stylistic, parody version of the cold war, totalitarianism. The rest of the movies eventually almost becomes more like an expensive video game as Harry and company get to survive to the next level in a series of disconnected, random levels. Throughout there are logic gaps, omitted scenes that avoided much needed character, plot development. The purported transformation from magical children entertainment into a darker fantastic juvenile action thriller merges too close the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy which in many ways remains a fantasy classic and by comparison pales in J.R.R.

","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I"" took up many difficult challenges such as tying up elements from the previous chapters together while not relying on expectations from fans with encyclopedic knowledge. Speaking for myself, as a ""newbie"", I enjoyed that penultimate film for what it was: an entertaining action-packed opus full of quiet and engaging moments.<br/><br/>The film also prepares us to a spectacular finale people have been waiting for during half a decade (half a month for me) without exhibiting any hurry to get into it, as if it took the proper time to tell its own story and as if the last book was too important to condense it into a three-hour format.<br/><br/>Now, there are additional objects of praises: the film allows us to get us a full view on every character who took part in Harry Potter's journey: Hagrid, the two good Defense Against the Dark Arts Teachers Rupin and Moody, the Weasley family (including Harry's sweetheart Ginny). And yet the film essentially focuses on the Power Trio: Harry, Ron and Hermione, taking them to locations they've never been in, as if the priority was to evacuate a few demons and seal their friendship first before they would find the definite strength in unity, to combine with the skills cumulated over their adventures at Hogwarts. I liked that aspect of the film.<br/><br/>And by the time it ended after two and half hours, I totally forgot there were still four or three Horcruxes to find and many obstacles paving the path to Voldemort. I don't know how this is going to be handled in Part II, especially in two hours and ten minutes (a rather short time by the series' standards), but I can't wait for the final round of the 'Harry Potter' series, a saga that defined a decade and where we literally saw three kids growing up before our eyes, while their world of wonder faded out, making way to the Dark Side.<br/><br/>Yes, long gone is the whimsical wizardry and its streams of spells and curses. The crucial moment occurs in the first act when Harry leaves everyone after the death of a few regulars (no need to spoil their name but surely you didn't expect a clean death toll?). He's intercepted by Ron who tells him to get off his high horse and stop thinking as the chosen one; this is no melancholy time when the Evil force commits mass killings and kidnappings, it's time to fight and everyone is on the same boat. Ron developed some maturity like Harry facial hair and he found the properly humbling words.<br/><br/>Which takes me back to the first film, I remember my first question was ""what is a Muggle?"". I initially thought the series was set in parallel universes (sort of) and there had to be zero interference between. ""Deathly Hallows"" opens with a nightmarish apocalyptic vision √† la 'Dark Knight' proving that not only the Muggles aren't immune to the wrath of Voldemort and his minions but that they're targets as well. And speaking of Voldemort, from the table scene reuniting all the main villains, with him as the master of ceremony, we also understand that the line between good and evil is now clearly drawn.<br/><br/>There are degrees of vileness though, some are more reluctant than others, but when you look at the top ""management"", you know no quarter won't be asked. ""Deathly Hallows"" is different in tone but made me retrospectively understand the tragic climaxes of the previous chapters, it was all leading to it. Whether J.K. Rowling had that scenario in mind when writing the first book, one can be dubious, but there was no way that such a set-up couldn't lead to a larger-than-life exploration of the dark side of wizardry.<br/><br/>And not only the film inspires such expansion but it also allows us to have a subplot revealing the deepest motives of Voldemort: his quest for the Deathly Hallows, three old relics that might allow him to become the Master of Death and whose symbol echoes some conspiracy imagery. Rowling had a wide enough universe and such a rich gallery of characters she had quite a toolbox to build an inventive adventure, but she still had room for new stuff, including the infiltration of Voldemort in the Ministry of Magic through a corrupt member named Plus Thicknesses (Guy Henry).<br/><br/>But the heart of the story is the adventure in the wilderness lived by Ron, Harry and Hermione sealing their friendship and testing their mutual trust. There are moments of tension (sometimes sexual), moments of fun and relief and there's also a part where they simply walking down the street in London (and I expected a Rowling cameo). I appreciated that for all its richness, the film didn't get too thick and took the time for some long panoramic shots and extended scenes with the trio, as a last brief halt into our most beloved characters before the final action.<br/><br/>There was action all right in the first and ending sections but this is a film quietly introspective and often captivating. I concede sometimes, many devices seemed too far fetched but the pace is so fast that you don't have time to step back and think of the flaws, our minds are set in the quest for the Horcruxes and the defeating of Voldemort. And the series has turned into such a dark tone that for all I know, Harry might lose the fight or have a Pyrrhic victory.<br/><br/>I personally believe the film owes us a happy ending by now so I'm looking forward to have my expectations fulfilled in ""Part II""."
"Lejink","6","0","0","13 July 2012"," Deathly dark...
","I have read the book but obviously have only come to this first part of the film dramatisation rather late in the day. Not a bad thing actually as it reduces the book-to-film comparison it's very easy to fall into. Thus I found myself watching it almost afresh and was able to watch it as a film first rather than an adaptation.<br/><br/>That said, I did find it slow in parts yet conversely haphazard in some of the no out essential editing to get the required halfway point of what is a very long and detailed novel. This method rather exposes the acting skills of the young leads and while they've come in a bit since the early adventures, I still don't think they can quite carry the movie off on their own shoulders. The action sequences are much darker and scarier than before but probably too far apart to really have the maximum effect. In between we get a lot of scenes in the dark, on the woods, by a loch and in a tent, where we're meant to get caught up in an imaginary triangle between Harry, Ron and Hermione. There's no Hogwarts, the Express train or even Hagrid's Cottage and also very little in the way of experienced support to relieve the lack of dramatic tension too.<br/><br/>This accent on melodrama reaches its nadir with the death of Dobbie in a terribly overblown ""Little Nell"" type scene. From there we don't even get a cliff-hanging climax to propel us onto the sequel, which while I will watch it soon, will I think be more satisfying as it reaches its conclusion. This did look to me very like half a film but with more vigorous editing could have ended up better than it did, at least in my eyes."

","Being the last book of the Harry Potter series you would expect all of the lose ends to finally be answered, however in this film I feel as though things were missed, events that would of made the film so much more than it was.<br/><br/>Of course they would split the arguably most important part of the franchise into two. But now looking at it, i wish they hadn't. Yes i love the cartoonish like graphics for the retelling of the Deathly Hallows story brilliantly narrated by Emma Watson but I found the entire film to be on the verge of boring. That says a lot since all previous films have been in my opinion outstanding. This film concentrates on to much of the storyline and no action. It lacks any gripping scenes and almost makes you want to fall asleep in the long conversations the characters have about nothing.<br/><br/>However, i do see why they decided to follow this course of the splitting of the book. But i feel that they have forgotten the main audience to this franchise. Young people. These people are less likely to want storyline and are more wanting of action and dramatic death scenes instead of discussions about ""what are we going to do now?"". That being said Dobby's death scene had to be one of the most emotional scenes in the whole film. It was truly heart wrenching the way the characters reacted and the sound of the lovable dobby's voice slipping away. That scene was pure class, was a shame we had to wait most of the film for that one moment however.<br/><br/>Overall the film needed more ""lets go"" and less ""lets sit and talk about it"", but if your a true lover of Harry Potter, i cant see why this film isn't an acceptable penultimate film to the franchise."

","Apprentice sorcerer Harry Potter is under the protection of his fellow wizards, as his nemesis Voldemort is waging a civil war within the magic realm. Harry is prophesied to defeat this evil tyrant, but how can he fight such a powerful enemy, and what is Voldemort's secret agenda ? <br/><br/>I hate to say it, but I found this Harry Potter film to be a bit of a chore. It starts well, with a big sky battle with the Death-Eaters and then a funny scene where our heroes infiltrate the new evil regime at the Ministry of Magic, but then it bogs down into a forty-minute sequence where Harry, Ron and Hermione just sit about, bicker, and don't know what to do in a succession of bleak beaches and forests. This section is dull, drab and a downer; when did Harry Potter turn into Finnegan's Wake ? The film picks up again for the last half-an-hour, when we finally learn what the Deathly Hallows are (through a lovely piece of calligraphy-style animation) and there's lots more action, but I'd cut out the whole middle-third of the picture (and wouldn't have split the seventh book into two parts either). What I love about these movies is their sense of wonder, the contrast between worlds, the humour and the crazy people, all of which works wonderfully, particularly in the first three films. As the continuing story gets more and more dogmatic a lot of that is lost; this one has no scenes at Hogwarts at all, and many of the most enjoyable characters are either missing entirely or only briefly glimpsed. Despite this it still manages to be fun, thanks to the stalwart efforts of the whole cast and the extremely high production quality. Some scenes are great, like the creepy sequence in Godric's Hollow, or Dobby's heroic return to save his friends, and as ever the visual effects are excellent - I especially like the goading monster in the locket which Ron has to destroy. I guess this was a tough picture to make - a fantasy film full of angst and with no ending - so it's pretty good considering, but for me it just doesn't compare with Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone."

About half the film is them looking for a locket, the other half finding out how to destroy it.

","I watched this movie like a year ago, and had no interest to re-watch it, so this review is totally based on my already faded memory. Don't get me wrong, my memory faded not because I have problems remembering thing, but because this movie has nothing much to remember.<br/><br/>To start, this Part 1 is totally different from the previous 6 Harry Potter movies. There is no Hogwarts, no Quidditch, no funny lessons. The film is set with very dark tone and theme, with visuals full of fear and loathing, doom and gloom. No more guidance from Dumbledore, no more protection from the adult wizards, it's the story of our three kids out on the streets, by themselves, trying to find and destroy something called ""Horcruxes"". Most of the time what they do is wandering in the forest, arguing, being jealous of each other, and our poor Harry sometimes hold his head in pain because of the Dark Lord Voldemort. The supporting cast did great, as usual, but too bad, the Trio takes most of the screen time and I can't get enough of my favorite evil side Snape by Alan Rickman and Bellatrix by Helena Bonham Carter.<br/><br/>Being Part 1 of 2, it goes without saying that there is very little closure come the film's finale, which despite being long-overdue within the lengthy 146-minute runtime, arrives with no climax. To be honest, there's still a lot of fun to be had, such as a gripping infiltration in to Ministry of Magic and a terrifying confrontation with Voldemort's pet-snake Nagini, and a fairy tale about the Deathly Hallows, but overall, it does not come close to expectation.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/"

","The Harry Potter films are the highest grossing film franchise of all time. This is precisely why when I heard that the final of J.K.

To me it seemed like a shameless attempt at milking as much money out of the moviegoers as they possibly could. However, after having seen both of the final films, I now see that it was really the best course of action that the filmmakers could have taken. The Potter films have gotten increasingly darker since the first one debuted way back in 2001. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is the darkest film of the bunch so far.

Nor was the wait worthwhile: the replies rarely added much. <br/><br/>It is also relentlessly morose ‚Äî not ""dark"" or even ""bleak,"" just depressing ‚Äî which one might forgive if the shreds of comic relief weren't so trite and half-hearted."

I like the way that they confront their fears but did anyone else see the lord of the rings connection? I mean seriously 'copyright', this horcrux is just like the one ring - it causes people to get angry and makes then sort of evil inside (when Ron was wearing it and couldn't take the horcrux's power, he thought Hermione was in love with Harry = awkward) I'm telling you someone has to tell J R R Tolkien about J K Rowling coping ideas.

","The end is near and now the power of Voldemort can clearly be traced out. This installments majorly focuses on the climax which is near. Henceforth the sole attention is paid to the action sequences. What I believe is that the movie is stretched without any reason just to produce another installment. Nothing much important happens in this part and the major part is left for the last installment. All the questions which were aroused in Half Blood Prince are majorly left unanswered. This is a let down again and the producers now are greedy for another one clearly. The romantic relationships are more focused without any importance just to cover up the running time. Therefore its really slow paced making you yawn at certain places. I would rather rate it 6.5. Its the weakest of all."

","I have now watched this movie twice, not because I enjoyed it the first time but rather to refresh my memory before I go and watch the last movie with my brother. My brother loves Harry Potter but I am not a big fan, and personally this movie seems to lack consistency. Okay, I have seen other shows which seem to wrap everything up quite quickly, and I am sure Rowlings does the same with her books (and unlike some writers, she did restrain herself to seven books, though the books do progressively get longer).<br/><br/>The first thing that irritated me about this book is that it starts as a children's story and progressively moves to more adult themes, however the names remain childish names (such as Hogwarts and Dumbledore) and that does not really fit in such a dark story (as it turns out to be). Secondly the movie begins with Harry searching for the six remaining horecrux's, but only finds one, and then suddenly has to go and find another three powerful magical items. One wonders if he simply abandons his quest of the horecrux's (though I guess I will find out soon enough). Further, much of the movie ends up with him finding a way to destroy the one horecrux he has, but seems to jump from dead end to dead end. In the end, though, this movie just turns out to be one big dead end.<br/><br/>No, I'm not a big Harry Potter fan.

The cinematography and acting is the best by far in this series. Even if this is a build up for part 2 it still has a lot of action in it, so part 2 is gonna be action packed with magic. This is the most mature Harry Potter movie and has a lot of dark tone to it for the better.

","This really is nothing special whatsoever, after Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince, I thought the film would have escalated to have much more suspense and a lot more action. I left bitterly disappointed. A brief synopsis of this very poor mess of a film is that Harry and his friends now go and find horcruxes and intend to destroy them, however they spend the whole film looking for one. This is nothing more than 2 hours of them camping in the forest, a very small battle with 2 wizards who nobody has ever heard of and a brief stand-off at Malfoy Manor. You should see it just to know what is happening if you haven't read the book. However if you have read the book and do not want to be disappointed - do not waste your money. It is nothing more than a money making strategy, this film is by far the worst Harry Potter film ever made. It is so bad that I sometimes forget that it was even released, I sometimes catch myself saying "" It's been ages since the Half-Blood Prince was released wasn't it? "" and my friends would reply with "" I know, but they made Deathly Hallows part 1 didn't they back in November? "". I barely recognise it as a film, it's more of a trailer for the part 2 if I'm completely honest. 5/10, poor, but not awful. Boring film, too long and too tedious. David Yates is going to have to give us something very special in part 2 to wash the away the horror of part 1."

And during all this time, basically only three things advances the story; you learn how to destroy the Horcruxes, you find and destroy one and you learn that Voldemort is after the three Deathly Hallows. Two and half hours for this!

There isn't no boring moment even when the characters are lost in their confusion. Two sets really amazed me: The ministry of magic and Godric's hollow.<br/><br/>However, the pace is maybe too fast because I got some holes at the narrative. First of all, this kind of movie should begin with a resume of previous movies. I take notes while reading thus i don't understand why the filmmakers don't do this same effort for the audience. If i went there with the kid, i imagine he would have been totally throw back by the beginning because a torture with dark people sitting around a table and a huge snake would appear crazy for the non initiated! Next, i didn't understand the problem that Voldemort has with his wand, how many horcruxes haven already been destructed and how many are left, why have they been followed in London.<br/><br/>Beyond those remarks about adaptation, the movie really takes its strength in the fantastic trio of actors.

"JamesHitchcock","6","0","0","8 January 2011"," A lengthy introduction to something else
","Unlike the other six novels in the Harry Potter series ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is being filmed in two parts of which this is the first, Part Two being slated for release in July 2011. The reason for this is that J. K. Rowling's last Potter novel is a long and complex one and that to film it all in one go would either result in a movie of insane length or involve omitting many scenes and details from the book, something which Potter anoraks would never forgive. (The film-makers took plenty of flak for altering some of Rowling's plot details in the earlier instalments).<br/><br/>It has become a commonplace to remark that the Potter series has been getting progressively ""darker"", both literally and metaphorically, ever since the third episode, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", and ""Deathly Hallows"" continues this trend. The plot is a complex one, concentrating on the efforts of Harry, Ron and Hermione to I will not attempt to summarise it here2010/2011 two-part epic fantasy film to find and destroy the Horcruxes, magical objects which hold Voldemort's secret of immortality. The Deathly Hallows of the title are three other magical objects which play an important part in the plot.<br/><br/>This film is the first in the series not to be set in Hogwarts School (although we learn that Severus Snape is the new headmaster). Since the death of Albus Dumbledore at the end of the sixth film, there has been a revolution in the wizarding world. Lord Voldemort and his supporters, the Death Eaters, have taken control of the Ministry of Magic and are using their new-found power to impose a quasi-Nazi dictatorship and to persecute Muggle-born or mixed-blood wizards. Whereas the atmosphere of the earlier instalments, especially those directed by Chris Columbus, resembled that of the traditional British boarding school story with added magical elements, parts of ""Deathly Hallows"" are closer to Orwell's ""1984"" or similar dystopian satires.<br/><br/>""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is not my favourite of the Harry Potter series; I certainly did not enjoy it as much as the previous entry, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". The acting is as good as ever, well up to the normal standards of the series, but the character of Albus Dumbledore was sadly missed. (He died at the end of ""Half-Blood Prince""). Whether played by Richard Harris or Michael Gambon, Dumbledore functioned as a source of wisdom and authority, the moral anchor of the series, and his absence from this film means that something feels lacking. The decision to film the novel in two parts does not seem to have come off, at least as far as Part 1 is concerned. Whereas all the earlier films ended with a satisfying resolution, this one comes to a rather abrupt close, leaving the plot hanging in mid-air. For all its length (nearly 2 1/2 hours), ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" feels less like a film in its own right than an introduction to another film which will not be released for another few months. We can only hope that part 2 will be better. 6/10"

We all expected the film to have us on the edge of our seats, chewing our nails down to the skin, and for the those that got up at midnight to get the book back in the days, probably crying. I can't lie I was on the edge of my seat, nibbling away, only to be severely disappointed that the film is in fact in two halves. I never got chance to reach the crying phase, should there have ever been one! Although the film makers did give us warning, I still felt some kind of conclusion was snatched away from me, being an avid book fan and all.<br/><br/>This instalment is basically all about Harry trying to finish off old Voldemort, whilst Voldemort tries to finish off Harry, dragging many more down with him along the way. Harry, Hermione and Ron search for Horcruxes (well more so Hermione and Harry as Ron jealously sulks in the background) which are the remaining pieces of the evil wizard's soul. However, they're not safely guarded by a three headed dog in a randomly chosen Hogwarts room this time, things have come a long way since then - battling with a snake, strangulation by a gold pendant chain and Ministry mayhem entail, all for a bit of soul. The action scenes are incredible, set in the most beautiful scenery, with the very much adult cast nowadays. For Daniel Radcliffe super fans out there, the writers have made ample time of shirtless shots for Harry, so fear not!<br/><br/>Now basically, I'll cut to the chase on whether you should see this movie and ultimately it has to be a big YES! Even if you've hated the books, slated the previous movies and been hell bent on being a true Uncle Vernon style muggle, you have to see this just for peer pressure. There will be nothing worse than coffee breaks at work, dinner with friends or even a bit of hardcore clubbing and not being able to share in the Harry Potter epidemic that grips the nation whenever a new film comes out.<br/><br/>Overall, a must-see."

Another thing is they don't tell people who have not read the harry potter books that Fleur was one of the triwizards in the goblet of fire and most people would think she's a brand new character. I also dislike the fact that they have not yet told you that Lupin and Tonks are about to have a baby.

","If you're a hardcore HP fan then I'm sure this movie will not disappoint. The first of the last, this film really does have to perform, and perform it does.<br/><br/>The mood of the film is a dark one, one of the darkest. As it turns out, Harry Potter gets darker and more depressing as they go along. However, what do you expect? Harry's adventures aren't designed for laughs, even though there still are some. It seems there is a little less action in this film. It focuses more on the characters themselves: Harry's quest to defeat Voldemort, Hermione's regret having left her parents and Ron's feelings for Hermione. Yes, there are still some fighting sequences from the start, but you have to remember that there's still another film, and those who have read the books will know that jinxes, curses and punches are plentiful in the second half.<br/><br/>As for the acting, you get the impression that the film makers have called over Daniel, Rupert and Emma and said ""look, this is the last film, OK? Let's make it a good one"". As a result, the performance has improved dramatically. Superb timing, I think. Voldermort and Snape say very little in this new instalment, though you still feel their presence in some way or another.<br/><br/>Despite all these fantastic additions to the film, I still have a few complaints. Even though the book is split into two parts, the writers have cut some of my favourite scenes out. They completely missed Dudley shaking Harry's hand and toned down the torture scene with Hermione and Bellatrix to retain their 12A rating. I would forgive them, yet I discover that they have gone and added completely unnecessary sequences to fill them in. I personally loath the scene where Harry and Hermione start dancing. It ruins the feeling of the moment, so you end up thinking ""huh?"". When Ginny asks Harry to do up her dress, you wonder why the writers have included it. Surely they could've shown their relationship better than just showing off skin. I also think that the trios journey into the Ministry of Magic dragged on a little, and the miming was quite obvious.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I still think it is one of the best films in the series, and Voldermort flying through the air was one of my favourite moments. It certainly leaves an impression on you when you leave the cinema."

","I was eagerly anticipating the first part of the Deathly Hallows but found it to be disappointing. I understand the need for simplification for those who haven't read the book but it seemed to me that the screenplay was over-simplified especially when it came to the main characters.<br/><br/>There was no suggestion of Harry's desire for the Elder wand and his torment at choosing the Horcruxes. There wasn't even a mention of the invisibility cloak which Harry has owned since the beginning! It was a great looking film however, and because of this and the fact I love the books I think it deserves a 6/10. Worth seeing but totally lacking the character depth and not even a hint of the subtle complexities of the books."

","The Harry Potter books and movies have been among the greatest and most successful franchises of all time--more successful, I dare say, than the New York Yankees whom people from other American League cities love to hate. This movie is the beginning of the end. Half of the final book. As I understand it, the other half is already in the can. With the story, the trio of young actors who have grown up in front of our eyes -- Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint -- will move or have already begun moving into the next stage of their careers, which we will follow with interest. It's likely, however, that they will never escape entirely from the penumbra of the Harry Potter series. <br/><br/>This particular chapter can be said either to drag in spots or to provide intervals of quiet between the violence that attends the pursuit of Harry Potter and his friends by Lord Voldemort and his minions. Although Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are undeniably the stars of this series, almost a generation of excellent British actors has employed in featured roles in various episodes of this series. Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter have meaty parts in this particular film, and since chewing the scenery is quite appropriate to the characters, Ms. Bonham Carter in particular comes very near chewing up an entire sound stage to splendid effect. Mr. Fiennes as the evilest of all the evil characters is successfully detestable, and Radcliffe, Ms. Watson and Grint are their usual brave selves under terrifying circumstances.<br/><br/>I'm not the age but I enjoyed the hell out it, something I cannot say for any other franchise film that I've had the misfortune of encountering."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 1 is automatically very different from the previous films. Why? Firstly, at no point during the film is it set at Hogwarts where the other films have been centrally based. Some may not like this change of scenery, however I do because it gives a sense of freedom (and growing up) for the three protagonists. Again this next installment of the saga gets even darker with more deaths, fights, snakes and torture. There is a reason why such films are placed with a certificate of 12, so I suggest that youngsters should not be taken in less you know they can cope. Even I jumped a few times with the appearance of the snake. Again this Gothic feel adds to the sense of growing of age and freedom, as the three protagonists get a feel for what real life is like after leaving the relatively safe haven of Hogwarts. Dangerous; particularly if you are the infamous Harry Potter or are friends with him. Many people have been disappointed with the film, saying that not as much occurs compared with the other films, however, don't forget it is only part 1, and all those who have read the book will know that we have saved the best 'til last, and that this film is setting up for the explosion as the series concludes. So please wait until you have seen the second part before you make your concluding opinion of the film, because some things may not add up until you watch the second. Part 1 focuses mainly on the three protagonists, their relationship with each other, and the task that Harry Potter has put upon himself, with the help of his friends. The film also shows how wicked Voldermort and his other death eaters are, particularly Helena Bohnam Carter, who plays her part fantastically.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a superb film that greatly lives up to my expectations. All aspects of it are really well done, story telling, character development, depth and emotion, even great action. Looking forward to part 2 which I feel has all the capacity, meaning even more thrilling plot to be even better!"

","Bravo, David Yates. You have done it once again.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read the books or watched the previous 6 films, don't even bother. You'll be lost and confused the entire way. But for those familiar with Harry Potter, I dare say you'll be pleased with the faithful adaptation presented to us. It's an entertaining ride from start to finish and despite having a runtime of 146 minutes, there wasn't a moment I felt it too long.<br/><br/>Touching on technicalities, it is undoubtedly a superbly filmed piece. And since the majority of the film is set in the Muggle (""real"") world, it provides a new and refreshing experience with beautiful scenery that isn't Hogwarts, all a backdrop for the wizarding characters and their exciting ventures.<br/><br/>And the acting is just brilliant. It's weird to think 9 years ago, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and (the ever beautiful) Emma Watson were just little kids thrown into the world of what was to be one of the greatest film series ever. Being roughly the same age as them, I can say I've travelled with them, grown with them, matured with them. That is exactly what they deliver, an extremely mature performance that shows their undeniable talent; and of course, the supporting characters, all veteran performers who just add to the brilliancy.<br/><br/>The pacing was criticised, and justifiably so. If you're looking for a concise and action packed-to-the-brim film, similar to the previous films, you won't find it here. But you will find a dark and emotional work that draws you in if you're willing. Bear in mind, it is only the first half of the epic finale. Oh, and the much talked about 'dance scene' that immediately divided audiences and critics alike? I didn't have a huge problem with it, but it certainly felt disjointed and out of place; not necessary, but I have to say, it was sweet.<br/><br/>Was it the best in the entire series? Some may argue yes, but I personally felt Half-Blood Prince to be superior, though this is a close second. Part 1 is a perfect setup for the resounding finale waiting in store for us next year. This was thrilling as it is; I can't imagine how electrifying Part 2 will be.<br/><br/>Personal Highlights: Other than all Emma Watson scenes (she can truly act), do watch out for a particular animated sequence in the middle of the film that is creative and innovative. Also, Harry and Hermione's visit to snow-covered Godric's Hollow is one of the most beautifully shot scenes in the entire film."

","If you enjoy the other Harry Potter films¬Öeven if you just like the books of Harry Potter¬Öyou'll love this movie! This was part 1 of a two part series of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" I honestly expected this movie to be action packed with all wands blazing with war...mainly because until now...I didn't know what the books were about, lol. Now that I know what the books are about, it's easy to see why the first movie was not as action packed as I originally thought. This movie was demonstrating that, even through the most difficult times...true friends will always be there. Interestingly enough...there were a few awkward scenes in the movie with the character Hermione and Harry. I'm not going to go into detail, because it may ruin the movie for you...but I'll just say that it seems like they are trying to form a love triangle with Ron, Harry, and Hermione. I could be wrong...but the movies seem to be headed that direction. Overall...it was pretty amazing! Definitely something you do NOT want to miss while it's in theaters!

","Almost everyone reading this review will have read the Harry Potter novels and seen the previous six films. Deathly Hallows part 1 is a natural progression from the earlier works--faithful to the book and very well done.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy the film very much, but that reflects the ""calm before the storm"" aspect of the plot. Everything in this film is preparing us for the final shootout (curseout?) that will take place in 7b.<br/><br/>We don't learn too much new in this movie. We already know that adolescents have sexual fantasies, Emma Watson looks good in jeans, and Voldemort is a really, really bad guy.<br/><br/>Except for the three stars, all the other regulars just have cameo roles, although Dauby has one great scene.<br/><br/>If you're into Harry Potter, naturally you have to see this film. If not, it's not the one with which to begin. <br/><br/>As always, the special effects are great, and many will be lost on a small screen. If you're going to see the movie, see it in a theater if possible."

","This is one of the best Harry Potter films yet. It follows the book very well (probably the best so far). This is my personal favorite Potter movie ever, It has the best acting yet and very amazing special effects. The actors are amazingly great and very well cast but have been from the beginning. This part of the series has just the right balance of effects and normal movie acting. Radcliffe has done an excellent job of being harry and always has but it is shown greatly in this movie. Watson is a very great actor and does an amazing job with this film. Grint has always been a good actor throughout all of the movies in this one though he does a superb job of portraying the character well."
"roguetrip99","7","0","0","20 December 2010"," A bit bland, but that's because all the action is in Part II
","*possible spoilers*<br/><br/>I first want to say that splitting the final movie into 2 parts was a stroke of genius, because it reduces the likelihood of the plot being completely butchered, which is what happened with all of the HP movies except the first two. As anyone who has read Deathly Hallows knows, much of the beginning involves the trio on the lam, hiding out in the woods, and doing a whole lot of nothing. Fortunately, DH part 1 doesn't deviate too much from the book, save for a completely unnecessary just-friends dance scene between Harry and Hermione. The scene in Godric's Hollow is creepy and nerve-wracking, just like in the book, although not quite as wonderfully terrifying as the cave scene in HBP. The scene in Malfoy Manor is also quite exciting, although again, the meat and potatoes of DH will be in Part 2. The acting in DH part 1 is wonderfully done, with no real exceptions. Helen Botham Carter is back as the deliciously evil Bellatrix Lestrange and Ralph Finnes once again captures his iconic role as Voldemort just right. Dobby (forgot who the voice actor was) really shines in this movie, and Imelda Staunton is back for a brief reprise of arguably the most despicable fictional character of all time; Dolores Umbridge. Overall, yes this movie suffers from a serious lack of action, but that's because that's how it is in the book. So no real complaints on my part."

","First of all, I must warn young kids who are hoping to see this movie that they are in for a bit of a disappointment. At the start of the HP film franchise they were more or less for children, but just as the title character reaches maturity in the book, so also the film's theme is more adult and more mature.<br/><br/>But seriously, David Yates has done an excellent job this time, compared to the previous 2 HP movies. Starting from the grim opening speech by Rufus Scrimegour to the end, the performance is top-class. The 3 main players (Radcliffe, Grint and Watson) are more good-looking than they were in the previous film, and I must say that Bonnie Wright (Ginny) looks gorgeous too. For once, Voldemort is seen having a meeting with his Death Eaters, among them the Malfoys and Bellatrix Lestrange (of whom Helena Bonham Carter still does an excellent and really scary job). The return of Dobby for me was well-timed and his tragic end really touched me. The wedding scene is tastefully done, so also is the escape from it by the trio.<br/><br/>If I have any knock for the movie, it is the meeting of Harry Potter and Fleur Delacour. Since Clemence Poesy (Fleur) was not present in HP6, it was only logical (for me at least) that she should have greeted Harry more warmly than the tepid embrace; after all, she hadn't seen him since the Triwizard Tournament. But this is only a minor detail and it does not spoil the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't wait for the final part. But I regret that after that, it will all end. The will come the difficult reality that no more HP movies will be made. I've thoroughly enjoyed myself and I will definitely feel sad when it is all over."

","After the slightly below par 5th and 6th instalments of this saga I was pleasantly surprised with this entry.<br/><br/>All the Hogwart aspects of these films are stripped away making this film feel more like a road movie as Harry and his friends search for objects that will destroy the evil Voldemort.<br/><br/>It's not without its slow moments but overall this film maintains the ever growing darkness that this series has been brewing towards while also allowing the three principle performers to play some scenes with depth. The cut off point for this film feels rightly placed while also leaving the audience wanting more. <br/><br/>All of the normal faces from previous films return albeit briefly but this film much like the last two feel like a drawn out build up for the final film."

I loved the Lovegood house. But Malfoy Manor was really disappointing.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the whole movie was the Tale of the Three brothers. I loved the animation and the style that was chosen to illustrate this story, it made a better impression on me like this than in the book.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie I was left with the impression that nothing had really happened but I wanted to see the next part because I recalled from the book that things happened next and I needed to see the end of it in a sense... <br/><br/>So not a bad movie in the sense it gave me the need to go see the next part."

","Reviewing ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is like reviewing ""Gone With the Wind"" after Scarlett O'Hara declares she will never go hungry again. On one hand, you know you've seen a very good first half. On the other hand, the latter had an intermission that was just a few minutes long, and the intermission to the former with be eight months (seven as of this writing).<br/><br/>Despite this obvious drawback, ""HP7: Part 1"" still holds up. As long as you know that the story will not resolve itself by the end (for some odd reason, a lot of ""critics"" didn't seem to be aware of this), you will be treated to a character driven epic that takes its time, is to-the-point, and features three strong performances from the well-rounded trio that is Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson.<br/><br/>In a brilliant and heartbreaking opening scene, the new Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) tries in vain to establish confidence in the wizarding community. Meanwhile, Harry watches out of his window as the Dursleys evacuate #4 Privet Drive. At the reconstructed Burrow, Ron Weasley watches the sunset with concern. And as for Hermione Granger, she is eliminating her parents' memories of her to ensure they cannot reveal her whereabouts or be concerned about her. It's a terrific opening; perfectly acted, well edited, and amazing enough, you will not find it in the book.<br/><br/>Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson own the screen from beginning to end without needing support from veteran adults. Though their body language was sometimes underplayed for various scenes, they still manage to convey their characters' deep emotions and conflicts. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Radcliffe and Watson. As many of commented, the dance between them in the tent (again, a great scene you will not find in the book) is a highlight of both their relationship and this movie. Watch how they play it. The dance isn't done for romantic purposes; it's two close friends trying to find solace in an immensely difficult time.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for Grint to get more meat to his role after film #4. Wish granted. He gets into why Ron can be both caring and selfish. Watch how he has to convince Harry early in the film not to search for the Horcruxes on his own, and then contrast it to when he lashes out at Harry for not having a plan to find them.<br/><br/>It's a strong film for writer Steven Kloves too. While ""Half- Blood Prince"" meandered, here he has constructed a focused script. Impressively enough, he manages to inject more humor into this film than what was in the book (the scene with the seven Harry's is a good example), but for the most part, he keeps an appropriately serious and sometimes retrospective tone.<br/><br/>As for David Yates, this is his best ""Potter"" film yet, and he's getting more sophisticated. The evacuation of Harry Potter early in the film proves he can do action, and I loved how he interpreted Ron's worst fears after he opened locket Horcrux. Some have said that he paced the middle section too turgidly, but I digress. He's taking his time developing the relationships between the main three. Plus, if it weren't for this section, you wouldn't feel the satisfaction that will come with part 2. It's this long trial that truly tests the characters' emotional mettle and ultimately makes them determine that this mission is worth it. Finally, just when I thought that basilisk from ""The Chamber of Secrets"" was scary enough, Yates made me jump out of my seat with what he did with Nagini!<br/><br/>In the art department, Stuart Craig doesn't have Hogwarts at his disposal, but I still enjoyed he designs to the Ministry of Magic (one scene looked inspired by ""Brazil""), Mr. Lovegood's house, and the Malfoy Manor. The film score by Alexandre Desplat wasn't as great as I hoped (you might miss his only usage of Hedwig's Theme in the beginning), but he still has some inspired moments, including ""Obliviate,"" ""The Ministry of Magic,"" and ""Godric's Hollow."" Eduardo Serra turns out to be a great choice to replace Bruno Delbonnel with the cinematography. I loved his wide shots as the trio hiked around England. Finally, the choice to animate ""The Tale of the Three Brothers"" was very inspired.<br/><br/>Admitted, there are small quibbles. A lot of characters get introduced in the first 20 minutes, some for exposition alone. Ron's reasoning for returning to Harry and Hermione isn't entirely convincing (although I did get a kick when he sheepishly raised the damaged locket to Hermione like it was some sort of wedding present). The mirror shard Harry has is an unexplained plot hole (only book readers will know why he has it). And, of course, this is only one half of a story (to be expected).<br/><br/>It was my impression, prior to watching this film, that the ""Harry Potter"" movies were at their strongest when they WEREN'T constantly loyal to their books. This is why I enjoyed films 3, 4, and 5, so much; they felt very much like their own tales and didn't feel like they had to be accountable to the novels. It is ironic, therefore, that this film holds very strong and is simultaneously close to the book. Perhaps Warner Bros. knew what they were doing after all splitting ""Part 7"" in two. Had it been one installment, character development would have been sacrificed and the film probably would have turned into an overlong treasure hunt. Instead, the story is allowed to breathe and gain significance. While this may only be a prelude, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" still ranks high on the best of the ""Harry Potter"" films. I hope Warner Bros. will hold special screenings in July that will allow us to see both parts back to back, as I think that will give this conclusion it's biggest punch."
"kapuffy26","Null","0","0","16 December 2010"," Worthy piece of filmmaking
","David Yates's adaptation of Deathly Hallows is perhaps the best HP adaptation I have seen to date, comparable only to Cuaron's third, visually enticing installment. Here, in Deathly Hallows, Yates experiments with mood, making a film that is truly gritty and entertaining. Not once do we, the audience, forget the dangers that the main trio are in. Every shot of this film is sprinkled with gloom and intensity, as is appropriated since the novel is no different. Firstly, I must praise the performances. Never had the trio given such nuanced performances. Gone are the days when Hermione bossed her two buddies around with her snobbish remarks and prudish sneers; gone are the days when Ron was regarded as mere comic relief; and gone are the days when Harry was just a mere wide-eyed boy, marveling at the beautiful expanse of his world. Emma Watson now plays Hermione with a sense of conviction and realism, Rupert plays Ron as a relatable human being capable of feeling a wide variety of emotions (including a keen sense of jealousy), and Dan plays Harry as an average guy who happens to be coping with the reality of his circumstances the only way someone of his age would know how. I like how Yates manages the scenes between the three, giving their friendship a great deal of depth. He is finally given the time to emphasize their dialogues, which--overall--enhances the character development.<br/><br/>The cinematography of this film is nothing short of extraordinary. I really admire the fact that good cinematographers have been hired to take on the last set of films (primarily those directed by Yates), since Bruno Delbonel mastered the camera-work for Half-blood Prince and Eduardo Serra did some intense work for Deathly Hallows. The camera-work is measured when it needs to be, but shakes in certain scenes as a means of providing a raw quality to the film. It fits the overall mood the film is conveying, emphasizing its pallid gray tones.<br/><br/>Lastly, Alexandre Desplat was an ideal choice of composer for Deathly Hallows. He truly knew how to produce a score that was as chilling as it was moving, adding an extra layer to this movie that could have been lacking if another--less learned--composer would have taken reign.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a huge technical achievement, proving that Harry Potter's story is not all about the whimsy and the magic; but about friendship, courage, integrity, dedication, love, and loyalty. Once Part 2 is released, these set of films will mark this series as a true classic, one that can stand next to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings."

","So i must start by saying that I am a huge fan of harry potter! Now, the evolution of the harry potter films has been a continuously tarnishing event. In my opinion, from the POA and on the movies were beginning to be terrible. No character development and limited magical experience. In HP and the Deathly Hallows part 1, another factor stood out. The fact that characters were not dressed in shabby clothes finally got out. Why did they insist on having the characters dressed like hobos. Anyways, I had definitely lost hope in the movies since i saw order of the Phoenix and half-blood prince. This movie rekindled my desire and love of the films. I thought breaking the book in the two parts was pivotal to contained most of the plot. At first I was afraid it would be a bust because it would not contain the battle of Hogwarts and I thought it would be Harry , Ron and Hermione just walking in forests the entire movie. I was wrong. Deathly Hallows part 1 contained a balance of action, drama and of course magical display. The struggle of the protagonist is so evident and illustrated extremely well. I need to see it again. and if you haven't, you should really consider it. The films are no longer suited for children but a more mature audience, so give it a try. If fantasy isn't your scene, this contains a great plot line anyways and its very possible you will enjoy this movie. The ending is a great cliffhanger and set up for what I am sure will be the greatest and of course the last of the Harry Potter films."

The first time I went to see this movie with one friend; eventually, I had seen it 4 times within the first two weeks because friends of mine who have *not* read the books did not understand, so I returned and actually had to explain why this was happening etc. I feel like more emphasis should have been placed on a certain character who is crucial in part II, and a character who should have died wound up surviving. How they will explain that in Part II is beyond me. Visually, it was breath-taking. The acting, superb (of course!) You can really feel as if you're THERE while on the journey. It is a bit of a tear-jerker for the sensitive people, but mainly because you realize that this is the movie before the **very** last one and you know it's coming to an end :P Some characters took on the role of others, which is expected in book-to-film adaptations; I loved this movie, however I feel that people should read the book before going to see it to really grasp what's going on.

","If you've read all the Harry Potter books, then you should know that, as the series went on, they essentially became an allegory for totalitarianism. Certainly one can see that in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson reprise their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. The three are now having to live almost in secret due to the almost fascistic takeover of the wizarding world by Lord Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) minions. In fact, while the three are undercover in the office building, the factory looks like something out of Nazi Germany or Stalin's USSR: the employees robotically help to publish material which pushes a fear of the ""other"" (in this case Muggles, or non-wizards). Harry, Ron and Hermione are like the French Resistance, one might say.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a good thing that they broke the final book into two movies. So far, they're doing a really good job not only bringing the magic to the screen, but also warning of the dangers that totalitarian entities - represented here by the Death Eaters - pose. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Tom Felton, Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Julie Walters reprise their roles from the previous movies, with new additions Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans."
"Jona1988","8","0","0","13 December 2010"," Satisfying and well simply great!
","Maybe the film company felt that by splitting the book into two movies they could make twice as much cash. But after seeing Part 1 I feel that even if money was the motive it was the right choice for the quality also. I was very satisfied with the film.<br/><br/>The seventh book was a great ending to a brilliant series. However if one splits it on the middle I think the first half is considerably weaker. The infamous camping parts where the book really started to drag. So one could expect the adaptation of the first part to feel a bit slower also. But I was positively surprised by how well they have succeeded, the film is not just very good on it's own but might even stand out as one of the better in the series. The series has gotten more and more mature for each film. Not just the tone and violence but also the characters, their emotions and such. It's great fun to see how the characters grow and the relations between them develop. It all works brilliant. I think the films have done well in capturing the feel of the characters form the books and in this film you get to follow them even closer. All the actors make a great performance. New additions to the cast Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans are good and suit there roles fine. The tone of the film is pretty gray and sad like the story, but they have done it well to get the right feel without making it dull and empty. The film stays on track and keeps the right tone all the way. Doesn't add any unnecessary jokes and no cheesy scenes or dialogue which has happened in previous films. No attempts to make the film both mature and childish, something one could fear they would try. The action scenes in the Harry Potter films has never been the strong point. The characters and story is still the best but the action has gotten better and this is without doubt the best yet. Thanks to being split in two the story telling is much more detailed and done in a more graspable pace. The story has gotten more complicated but I feel it's easier to follow whats going on here than in Prisoner of Azkaban. I can't imagine how the story could be told in a good way in just one film, doing it like this was the best way.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a superb film that greatly lives up to my expectations. All aspects of it are really well done, story telling, character development, depth and emotion, even great action. Looking forward to part 2 which I feel has all the capacity, meaning even more thrilling plot to be even better!"
"knox_jamal12","10","0","0","11 December 2010"," Just the Beginning of the End
","""¬Öjust the beginning of the end"". That is what the first part of the final chapter in the Harry Potter says to me. With the first six films being a mere premise to the last two films of the franchise, to think about coming end to the cherished series cause me a bit of sadness. Being a die-hard Harry Potter fan, this particular ""Part One"" did not disappoint.<br/><br/>This film opens with an epic struggle for survival as seven ""Potters"" attempt to smuggle Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) out of his Aunt and Uncle's house given his upcoming birthday. The dynamics of the scene give an immensely powerful first statement for the film. The screenwriter Steve Kloves does a brilliant job in my opinion of manifesting the action from the novel on the screen. Throughout the movie we see a different turn from previous Potter movies. We see a lot more of the dynamics in the characters relationships with each other. We see a little bit more romance, lightly played but obvious. We see present well within the movie the idea of Harry's dependence on Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). We see a lot of team work present and suiting the feel well, the story begins to slow down allowing bit more room for back story explanations. This time the feel of the film is one of a slower pace, which in my opinion serves well to ease the audience into the films inevitable end. I whole-heartedly agree with the decision made to split the film into two parts. I think that it gives more space for the storyline to spread out and really capture the whole big picture, as is illustrated well in Rowling's book. Plus it brings even more money to the franchise.<br/><br/>The actors also have done an amazing job throughout the whole decade that this film has taken to rise to its current and immense glory. We've had the privilege to watch as Daniel Radcliffe, brilliantly portrayed as the scrawny bespectacled boy we grew to love in the first book and movie, to the mature, beastly looking hero, taking an even greater leap from the books' descriptions and making the change from Daniel to Harry on screen all the more powerful and beautiful. Watson also grew from slightly annoying and cute little girl to a smoking hot, mature British woman, despite her recent hair change. Rupert Grint even did a bit of growing up. He's gotten a deeper voice, but remains that endlessly loyal companion to Harry throughout all the films. The actors and actresses have always played their given parts brilliantly. It surprises me that most of the whole cast and crew have been there from the beginning (except for the directors). It's further touching to reflect on the brilliant family these people have become in the production of this amazing franchise.<br/><br/>In retrospect there are some things that I do wish had been done better. Like some of the finer ends of the movie were a little left out. But I think overall David Yates did a great job with this film, as he has with the previous films he's directed in the series. He definitely seems to me the most familiar with the tone of the movie and though shaped the film in a way that suited him, his taste suits the novel and the rest of us just fine. I definitely look forward the final installment of the franchise this upcoming summer. It will be a bittersweet birthday present, considering I began my journey with Potter on my birthday nearly 10 years ago. I recommend this movie to any who'll watch. It will not disappoint."

","This is a very good movie and I'm not really a good fan of Harry potter, but in this movie the directors capture my attention with amazing special effects. Also the history has a lot of comic scenes and then BAM an action Scene. So I recommended this movie. Also the effects in 3D are very good. The directors make an excellent decision to divide this movie in two parts because in the end you will want to see the final part. Actually I have to see the other harry potter movies because I don't remember a lot of details of the history, so I have to spend some time to see them. So for all the really fans of harry potter you are going to enjoy the movie, and for all the people who aren't fans of harry potter also you are going to enjoy it."

","The perfectness of HP and the deathly hallows part 1 cannot be spoken in words.<br/><br/>The film starts off with the Warner Bros logo, but it's more darker than in the previous HP film. From that moment and onwards the movie had action/excitement in almost every scene until the end. The plot is awesome and more personal drama is introduced as the movie moves on.. It follows the book almost perfect with only some bits cut out which doesn't really make a big deal in the plot itself. I was beginning to wonder when the movie was nearing it's end if it would cut in a bad scene without any notification before the credits began to roll, but i was clearly wrong as the movie was cut after a carefully chosen scene which is going to haunt the HP fans for the next 7 months until the last part is shown on cinema! Thanks Yate for making one of the greatest HP movies yet!"

","Amazing! Harry Potter returns with this fantastic new movie based on the book, but unfortunately it's part one. But I guess the benefit is that Harry Potter doesn't end yet. A benefit for the filmmakers too, as they may make more money.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy the lack of action, though. Since the move preceding this one, I have not seen much action, or fighting. The beginning, there was fighting, but that seemed to be it. It simply seemed to be that the movie was about characters walking around in a forest and hiding. There was a pretty action-backed, and suspenseful and sad scene at the end of the movie, but it wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Ignoring this, I can see why this is an amazing movie, and that is why it deserves such a high rating."

","Deathly Hallows part 1 is arguably the best Harry Potter film to date, right up there with the first film. I was slightly disappointed at first, but upon my second viewing I fell in love with it.<br/><br/>Hogwarts is completely absent from this film. It now focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione leaving their previous lives behind and going into hiding and on the run from the ministry of magic which has been infiltrated by Voldemort's minions. Much of the film takes place out in the wilderness.<br/><br/>We see the trio's friendship strained and repeatedly tested, living in close quarters and struggling to track down the remaining ""Horcruxes""-objects in which Lord Voldemort has contained a fragment of his soul. In order to put an end to Voldemort once and for all, they need to locate these Horcruxes and destroy them. Their journey takes them all over the countryside of Britain.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film was a scene in which our heroes disguise themselves as Ministry Of Magic employees using Polyjuice Potion and infiltrate the ministry, which has now become very Nazi-like in their efforts to detain and interrogate witches and wizards who aren't ""pure-blood"", and those working against Voldemort. BRILLIANTLY done, and while this film has much less light-hearted humor than the last, there are a few chuckles to be had in this scene.<br/><br/>The actors are at the top of their game, I can think of no one here who turned in a lackluster performance. And as always, the film is chock full of highly respected British actors such as Rhys Ifans, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, etc.<br/><br/>The film does have some emotional moments where I could feel myself struggling to keep from getting a little misty eyed. It's unfortunate that the saddest scene is at the end, which does leave a not-so-happy ending, but what can you expect seeing as this is only part 1.<br/><br/>The film isn't for small children, but if they have seen the other films, they will be fine. There's no cursing here beyond ""piss"" or ""damn"". There is a scene that suggests passionate nude kissing, of course without showing parts. There is one scene with a decent amount of blood when a character nearly looses an arm, and also a somewhat brief torture scene (by magic) that is mostly heard rather than seen.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing and moving, very well done. I particularly like ""The Oblivation"" and ""Decoy Detonators"".<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic film. Don't attempt to really understand what's going on if you're not familiar with the past films, you'll be pretty lost."

","Now this movies seems to be spit on by some, and just loved to the core by others.And people are lost to why this seems to be happening. I think it's mostly from the people that have read these Novels, and who have just watched them. That seem to be saying these to totally different points of view. To the ones that say it was awful. Seem to think it was slow and nothing really happened. But to the ones who say other. Are finally happy they stayed to the Novels more then the other movies.<br/><br/>Further more they are really trying hard on making this one close the gaps of all the questions.To do so the splitting into two movies was a great idea. People try to say it was just for the money, but form the detail and pure intensity of it all. It rather hushes that to me. Now if they would have made just one movie. It would have to be 5 hours to try to explain the whole destroying of Voldemort and the intensity of why it's not so easy. Which would have pleased some people, but do you want to sit through that? So the two part was a good idea.<br/><br/>For what a good job they have done. If they stay on the same track. They should bring out another movie that will make those ""movies"" people enjoy it, and this one more then they do now, and keep the novel people further pleased. For as of now. The split liking will stay. After part two. That should be shut up.<br/><br/>I will be waiting impatiently for part two from now on. Two thumbs up."

","It is a shame that Warner Bros decided to split the franchise into 2 parts, but that was however a very smart move. Even though the movies were made to satisfy the fans, but its main reason was to make more money with Harry, Ron, and Hermoine. We'd watched all three of them grow for a decade, now to think that they're all adults and the franchise is going to be over soon, it is an odd feeling to say the least. The wizard world is corrupting because Lord Voldemort is back with his powers. Even the Ministry of Magic has to hide. The movie takes us on a journey with the three friends rather than giving us a battle between Harry and Voldemort. This is the number one reason fans are complaining about: there wasn't enough action and adventure. But in my opinion, the movie is just building tension for the next one. Even though the film doesn't give much on action, the acting is perfectly where we want it. The three friends give it their all but standing out is Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and his evil companion Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter). The make-up part in the franchise is always mesmerizing to see. These artists must've worked really hard to have Voldemort's face looked like that! Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 does not disappoints at all, not with its fine acting and brilliant make-up."
"Stampsfightclub","8","0","0","5 December 2010"," The end is drawing closer
","The seventh instalment of the world's biggest franchise opens the way you may expect our Prime minister to act, as if Bill Nighy was channelling David Cameron and with such a moody tone about you know who's return, you know instantly this will once again be the darkest Potter to come out of Warner Brothers.<br/><br/>As always going to see a Potter film at the cinema is a not to be missed experience. To see all familiar faces with the stakes higher than ever was exciting and we will never see anything like this ever again.<br/><br/>This particular instalment, based on J.K Rowling's global knockout stories, is the first part of the last book, seeing the three main characters set out on a mission to destroy all of Voldermort's horcruxes, which are part of his soul.<br/><br/>Returning director David Yates lets us know straight away we are in for a rough ride as a tearful scene sees Hermione wipe her parents memories. A too brief and not intense Dursley leaving and a torture at Malfoy's home will set the tone for the two and a half hours.<br/><br/>However you can always rely on the supporting cast to give you a good chuckle to remind us of what Potter is all about. Fred and George, albeit brief have a great few lines and screen time, Dobby the house elf you can't help but laugh with and Ron always has something to say.<br/><br/>It is great to see Rupert Grint get more intense and angry and his character's jealousy sees the young star at his dramatic best.<br/><br/>Radcliffe continues to cement a consistent character before our eyes and Watson is given more drama as well. There was a gut wrenching corny dance sequence that is the worst thing to ever happen to the series and my friend and I just looked at each shaking our heads. But in all honesty these two are the stand outs as the film is all set on the roads.<br/><br/>The landscape settings are tremendous, some great choices and picturesque art styling. There was a good chase sequence through a forest and the settings at Godric's Hollow was brilliant.<br/><br/>Critics and fans have looked at this release and raised an eyebrow at the 12A certificate. There are certainly a lot more graphic notes. A torture scene at Malfoy's, a nude Harry and Hermione and snakes that attack the camera. There are a lot of dark themes and scenes here so if you plan to take your children be cautious.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the darkness is required given the context of this careful story. The stakes have raised and things are worse than ever for muggles and wizards alike. We find constant surprises as the trio are jumped numerous times by evil wizards, there is a lot of animosity between friends and family and Voldermort always seems present as we revert back into dream sequences.<br/><br/>At first everything is fast paced with great action, plenty of magic and a tender sadness given all injuries and deaths. When on the run the pace really slackens and you wish it would get moving again and thankfully it does in a flurry of wand battles, evil horcruxes and bloody torture.<br/><br/>This isn't the best Potter by a long shot but it is, as always, something totally unique and entertaining.<br/><br/>Only one more to go."
"julian-mumford","8","0","0","5 December 2010"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1)
","Harry Potter has come a long way, from sunny Hogwarts, Butter Beer and Quidditch. Moving steadily and stealthily throughout the intervening years, from the light to darkness.<br/><br/>This seventh outing has been split into two parts, with the concluding part 2 released in July 2011. This is either because the story is too big to be compressed into one film, or perhaps more money can be made from two separate films, depending on your level of cynicism.<br/><br/>There is precious little sunshine in this episode, moving the franchise into ever murkier and complex themes, stretching the limits of scares, mild horror and peril, that the child friendly certificate will allow.<br/><br/>Following an excellent opening, we are left with Harry or multiple versions of Harry, attempting to flee from the enemies ranged against him. The importance of possessing ""True Blood"" is now consuming the wizarding world with random ""interviews"" and detainment at the whim of the persecutors.<br/><br/>There is a strong inference of an almost Third Reich like pursuit of anyone not conforming to the ideal and this truly takes the story into a disturbing underlying direction, if one chooses to look.<br/><br/>The action is centered on Harry, Hermione and Ron as they flee to desolate windswept moors, dense woods and rolling seascapes, searching for the elusive Horcruxes to destroy. Well loved and new characters appear briefly and just as effectively as before but it is the young wizards show in this episode. It seems strange to see the characters interacting with the real world in a mundane way, strolling down Shaftesbury avenue, ordering cappuccinos in a bedraggled caf√©, something we have not seen before.<br/><br/>An ever more dangerous and ruthless Voldemort (Fiennes), continues to pursue Harry who is again aided by his friends Hermione and Ron, all actors returning to roles they have effectively grown up with in real life. The acting abilities of Ratcliffe, Watson & Grint has always been the franchises weakest link, especially when playing against a roll call of top flight English character actors. Grint has always fared best, largely playing a representation of himself, Watson has improved, leaving Ratcliffe trying hard but always appearing to act rather than just being, which is what screen acting is all about.<br/><br/>The production values are off the scale, Warner Brothers knows this film will make money and together with Director David Yates, have really pushed the boat out. The film is long but well paced and breaks up the action with differing film styles, shaky cam, flashbacks and a beautifully animated sequence where the Deathly Hallows tale is recounted.<br/><br/>The story is well known by all those who have read the books and again the film stays largely true to the source material. A standout scene being a visit to Harry's childhood home, which in the book lends itself to a cinematic outing and here it does not disappoint.<br/><br/>To enable infiltration into the Magical ministry the three characters swap with older employees and we are then treated to three different actors playing the parts of Ron, Harry and Hermione. This allows a sliver of humour which is a welcome relief as the plight of our heroes grows ever more dire. Bill Nighy, always a welcome addition to any cast list, also joins the ensemble as the Minister of Magic.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see the action straining the envelope of what is acceptable to a young audience that have grown up with the films. There are occasions where a slightly extended shot would have added more dramatic impact, rather than a cutaway to blood artfully splashed against the wall. This is not to say we want full on gore but noticeably the transformation at Godric's Hollow would have been more effective with just a few seconds more.<br/><br/>The extended death scene is perhaps a slight misstep, loaded with emotion for a character that some, may not regret passing on. To be fair, JK Rowling does not give the film makers much to work in this regard, as readers of the books will know. A slightly awkward dance scene, does end up as somewhat touching but does flirt perilously close to giggle territory.<br/><br/>Overall this is fun, exciting and scary in parts for younger children. Emotion was perhaps never the franchises strong point and this episode is no exception. However the tone, story and quality throughout the series has always been consistent and if this is anything to go by, we are in for a treat as the series completes.<br/><br/>This is very much a setup film for the final denouement and for those who do not know how this works, expect an abrupt end to this episode, ensuring your return in 2011.<br/><br/>Interestingly the film was to be released in 3D but the conversion process was halted as the target release date could not be met. Part 2 should be ready to be shown in the extra dimension if you prefer.<br/><br/>Summary A very effective thriller or almost ""horror lite"" in places, a film that can stand on it's own, with or without what has come before.<br/><br/>Let us hope, that similar to the Lord of the Rings, on which some of these themes are loosely based, we will enjoy an equally strong finish for part 2.<br/><br/>Recommended"

","I almost forgot that I was watching one of the Harry Potter's movies. I feel like in a different universe compare to its predecessors. Thiz last grand epic is still directed by David Yates who was unknown Director before his involvement in the 5th film ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" in 2007. Actually, Yates has ever tried to implement thiz kind of atmosphere into the 6th film ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) which is dark and gloomy with more realistic approach. But back then, it wasn't supported by attractive storyline. Thiz is the finale of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world when everything is about to end. The villain Voldermort (upss¬Ö I mean You-Know-Who) gets stronger than ever. Harry Potter and his two loyal friends Ron and Hermione have to find hidden Horcruxes in order to destroy the dark lord himself. The movie starts with the doom element and dark impression everywhere, and then enters into Special Effects extravaganza, just like the previous prequels. The story as we know it before, it is centered on Harry, Ron and Hermione. Thiz chapter explores the unrevealed relationship further and for the result is something very different. I think I can see what happens here. Yates tries to lock them up alone in the same room, and then see what could possibly happen. For the first time in thiz franchise, Yates has shown us that Harry Potter's movies aren't just always about Special Effects exhibition, but also about the depth of its characters. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) has done everything he can, to show more mature emotions. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) improves his acting better than ever. Emma Watson (Hermione) has grown up to be a beautiful and gorgeous girl. She obviously has the most promising career in the future. The heavy caliber Supporting Cast members are also in solid performances such as Alan Rickman as Prof. Snape, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange and even Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Yates himself explores every possible technique that he could find, like flash back sequences, racking focus, bird's eye angle, hand-shake camera and even graphic animation when he reels of ""The Tale of Three Brothers"". The animation is artistic, enjoyable and mind-blowing. I ever hoped that Guillermo Del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth"" {2008} and ""Hell Boy"" {2007}) would be the Director of thiz last phenomenal epic. With his resume it will be perfect! But that never happened. Each of us has been growing up with thiz franchise. The franchise itself certainly manifests being more than just the movies, but it's also becoming the part of our culture in thiz generation. It is ""Wingardium Leviosa"" to the highest level, ""Expelliarmus"" all the bad factors, and it surely won't be ""Obliviate"" for a long time, it will be ""Lumos"" brightly until the end.

","Now, as a hardcore Potter book reader, i have been particularly annoyed at how short and relatively unconvincing the previous 6 films had been. Six (Half-blood Prince) in particular was a major disappoint - Yates and Kloves absolutely destroyed what was my favourite book...<br/><br/>However, scepticism aside, i chanced a Potter 7 viewing, only at the cheap night at my local cinema mind, and dared the film to fulfil it's potential and finally live up to what is arguably one of the greatest book series... ever.<br/><br/>After the opening sequence and some truly dreadful acting from young Mr. Radcliffe, i was beginning to wonder whether it would be another for the ""it could have been amazing""-pile. However, the Hedwig charge to save Harry's life had me wondering... perhaps it's actually been written well for once? The heartwarming exchanged thereafter between the weasleys and their brother and son, George, were the big start to the roller-coaster ride of emotion that film geeks, book geeks, and people that just fancied abit of potter were treated to.<br/><br/>Not only has the film VASTLY improved on the previous 6, it very nearly lives up to the genius that was displayed in the book. quick shot changes and classic slow pan to extreme close up switches, were a bevy of the shots that us young film making 'wannabe's' aspire to reproduce. Yates finally convinced me he is not only a half decent director, but that he hasn't given up on his roots as an aspiring artist, displaying his masterpiece through film.<br/><br/>The script and good use of camera work had us as an audience jumping out of our seat one minute, and crying at the tragic death of an old, albeit annoying, friend the next. Even the vacancy in the bafilda bagshot character that was displayed in the book was perfectly produced to a tee.<br/><br/>Although it did miss out one or two things from the book, and certain story elements were slightly changed, the overall emotional ride created was enough to have me convinced - this film is going to score high. However i have to hark back to a previous point, Daniel Radcliffe REALLY cannot act. If it were not for his bratish nature and unconvincing anger issues, this film would easily hit the top of the 9 star bracket... however, all things considered, 8/10 seems fitting.<br/><br/>One thing it does do is leave me wondering, if this is what Yates can do with some time and a movie split in two, can it be possible for him to pull off the shere epic-ness that is - The Battle Of Hogwarts? Now that remains to be seen."

Layer by layer the filmmaker very beautifully drops hints as he unveils the mystery slowly and steadily leaving you satiated yet desperately anticipating the second and final chapter of Deathly Hallows. <br/><br/>As the film progresses you too start solving the jigsaw puzzle. The plot is racy, characters arresting, action scenes thrilling and cinematography chilling. The twists and turns, suspense quotient, drama and fun elements all co-exist making it one of the most gripping Harry Potter films. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I meets all the expectations you had from the most awaited final chapter of the Potter films. <br/><br/>worth all the hype! The wizard casts his magic spell and how! Watch it"
"www-jats","7","0","0","22 November 2010"," not as good as the originals
","It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one, if they haven't read the books already.<br/><br/>With this film, we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise, like Harry Potter himself, has grown and matured as the years (and films) progress. Part I of the ""Deathly Hallows"" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant, bittersweet finale for everybody.<br/><br/>I won't waste time trying to talk about the performances, because they are all great and powerful in their own way. Never mind that many of the cast members are very talented veteran British actors (try getting John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, Imelda Staunton, Jason Isaacs and Bill Nighy in the same film again) - the three young actors who we have come to love and care for following the first film a decade ago, basically carry the franchise on their shoulders, and this film is no exception. Radcliffe looks handsome, Grint looks gruff, and Watson looks gorgeous. They've grown into fine young people.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Steve Kloves doesn't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds, but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it. Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle, but also a character-driven ensemble; there's some complex characterization here. Also there's some action which aren't seen on screen, but mentioned by the characters. It's OK, because it's necessary for the brisk pacing, and it's not really that important anyways. Besides, the human mind can imagine these images far more powerfully.<br/><br/>There are many themes in this film. Sacrifice, determination, (obviously) friendship, and above all - acceptance. As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum - signaling that all hope may be lost. But in the end, will good triumph over evil? Like the film, real life isn't so sure. Also, the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films - it's also another way of acceptance - the films have ended, they're moving on for the better of their lives/careers. It's real life, and I wish all these promising young actors brilliant lives and careers ahead of them.<br/><br/>""Hallows: Part I"" is many parts thrilling, as there are quite a number of intense action sequences. Many of them, of course, are done with well-rendered visual effects, and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring. However, the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping, dramatic moments. They don't feel heavy handed and it's beautiful to look at. The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jaw-droopingly beautiful to both watch and listen. If separated by itself it can win an Oscar for best animated short.<br/><br/>The crew also get their due here. David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago. The cinematography is stunning and exquisite, and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film. The editing is also crisp, it's not choppy when it doesn't need to be. Alexandre Desplat's score really makes a difference, it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful, harmonious, and emotional tones.<br/><br/>In short, I would have to say that this film is the best ""Harry Potter: film yet in all honesty. I grew up with the series, and as per the actors, it will be an emotional goodbye. But rest assured, the finale will be grand.<br/><br/>One more thing. This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet. The novel is done justice, something not seen since the first three films. It's something for both the fans and novel-readers alike, as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film. It's definitely a huge improvement over ""Half-Blood Prince""'s adaptation, which for me is the worst Potter film.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a phenomenon. But, like all things, it most come to an end eventually. This is the beginning of the end, and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 75/100"

","OK thats the 2nd time they have blown the International Statute of Secrecy to smithereens but apart from that this movie numbs you, goosebumps you, sends a shiver down your spine (like Dementors are nearby). A thrilling, very gripping and the loyalest to the great novels yet, this movie is a definite must-see. Lets start with the story; as I said it's very (almost completely) loyal to the book, you don't have to worry about that. Gripping, oh and BTW the Tale of the Three Brothers is filmed beautifully. Its very creative. Number two, is the acting of the three most likable stars, Daniel Radcliffe is politely and tauntingly replying to all those skeptics and critics that he's really grown into a marvellous actor and that he'll never ever be stereotyped. Rupert Grint has portrayed the brooding, friendly, a bit double-minded and the deepest fears of Ron Weasley as though they are his own, from now on versatility has a new meaning - Rupert Grint I am still recovering from this girl who I don't know why is trying to blow me away, apart............anything Emma Watson has shown that she's the top girl in Hollywood for a reason. She's attached to Hermione Jean Granger like they are Loving sisters and for that matter she shuts up those blabbing mouths that had been critical of the fact that she once thought of leaving the series and never fully or truly came back. Believe me I am not biased but these three are future Hall of Famers. Tom Felton hasn't had much to do yet cause Draco's major portion is the second part as is Ralph Fiennes's but I know they're gonna be great. The rest of the cast including everyone from Dobby to the newest Potter Cast member - Rhys Ifans (Xenophilius) and also Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour), were an absolute delight to watch.I was so much absorbed in the movie that the 148 minutes of this fantabulous flick flew by like 20 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Nutshell - Do yourself a favour and watch this movie for sure. P.S:- Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography for this movie is a must."

","To start with, The Deathly Hallows is, like a hundred other reviews would have said, the best movie within the Harry Potter franchise. It is dark, exhilarating, vaguely funny, a mood lifter and most importantly, it stays to the book. Yes, David Yeats gets it right this time.<br/><br/>The movie has been cleverly split into two parts, and this one ends at unarguably the perfect moment, leaving the audience wanting the 2nd part at the earliest. Rowling's masterpiece has been delivered in a visually stunning 2 hour format with success.<br/><br/>Coming to the cast, the regulars have done a great job, playing the roles of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley, while Ralph Fiennes continues to show why he should be in the list of one of the best Antagonists ever, as Lord Voldemort. Special mention to the crew, who have brought a dramatic change from the usual score, to a completely new and better one. Also, the animated shot of the Tale of The Three Brothers has been depicted wonderfully and is one of the many bright spots of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning, with beautiful scenic shots taken in different climatic conditions, and never fails to impress. David Yeats has done more than sit in a director's revolving chair and makes this movie an immense success. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have developed really mature as actors and their chemistry on-screen is magic. There are a few lighter moments during the movie, amidst, to put in Rowling's words, dark times, and those moments are more than welcoming.<br/><br/>If at all, there were to be a downfall, it would be the pace. Ironically, this has also been one of the positives, but there were times when we wished the next scene would come soon. Yates has delved deep into his previous mistakes and tried to make sure they never repeat, with major success.<br/><br/>In the end, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 1 has certainly lived up to its hype, lived up to the book and will certainly be the foundation for what is believed and hoped to be a gripping end to this magnificent story. Great watch, great visuals, great acting, great story. <br/><br/>9 / 10."
"mamamia126","9","0","0","26 November 2010"," Though different from any of the other films, BRILLIANCE!
","As a die-hard HP fan, (meaning I've read every on of the books, some multiple times), I was more than satisfied with the this film. After being slightly disappointed and longing for something after the last couple of films, David Yates has brought the initial ""magic"" to the movie franchise that I haven't completely felt since the second film, The Chamber of Secrets. The ironic thing, however, is that this film was a MAJOR departure from the first few. As I'm sure any fan has noticed, the movies have gotten increasingly darker and darker, and this was no exception. Because the series has reached its highest point of intensity, this movie is exempt from familiar screen-shots of Hogwarts, jolly trips to Diagon Alley, Quidditch, the Great Hall, and even the familiar, ""cute and magical"" melodies often heard at the beginning of the films. The Hogwarts ""crew,"" (Neville, Cho, Seamus, Dean, etc.) are only shown once in the whole film, and only for a brief scene in which they chased off Death Eaters. The whole movie chronicled Harry, Ron, and Hermione's search for horcruxes, enlightenment of the tale of the Deathly Hallows, and evasion from the Death Eaters, who are now stronger and more than ever, having taken over the Ministry of Magic. <br/><br/>One thing I really liked about this film is the audience involvement with the Death Eaters as we ""sit in"" on their meetings and watch intense interaction between the members. I commend the cinematographers and visual effects artists for awesome ""action scenes,"" but I have never been disappointed by the animation in any of the HP films.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints is that it definitely seemed to be dragging towards the middle while Harry, Ron, and Hermione camped out at different sites and tried to figure out their next moves in the conquest for the horcruxes. For about 45 minutes, it seemed like the film wasn't going ANYWHERE, but that could probably attributed to the fact that Harry wasn't getting anywhere in his search.<br/><br/>The ending action was satisfactory, but kind of abrupt. As much as I am eager to watch the conclusion to the series, I couldn't be happier that the film was broken up into two parts. It just seems virtually impossible to fit the last book into one film without leaving out crucial elements to the plot. And in this book, even the details that SEEM minor initially are essentially crucial to the end.<br/><br/>The acting was stellar. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have grown, matured, and improved on-screen incredibly over the last ten years and it is especially visible in this film. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix LeStrange was fabulous as usual.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved the film and am impressed with David Yates' adaptation of such a genius storyline!"

","If it is a film for fans only, it turns out that I'm not a pious fan of Harry Potter series, which could be the truth, I only read one book (I vaguely remembered it was the third one), still I will be satisfied to watch the final installment next year, even though this one hardly meets my appetite. <br/><br/>Okay, let me complain a little bit about the pace, I sense that the trio's road-trip is lengthy and the conflict between Harry and Ron is weakly ensnared (have no idea it is a faithful adaption from the book), and as an average audience, I am very puzzled with the subtraction of how 7 Horcruxes suddenly reduced to 3 after they destroyed one in the film. On the other hand, lots of supporting characters sacrificed their screen-time in order to leave enough stage for the trio, which effectively extinguished a great quantity of fun (poor Snipe only appears in 5 minutes at the beginning). <br/><br/>The great side is that even the plot is getting darker and darker, the merrier moments are all deprived from the film, nevertheless this film is not as scare as its recent precedents (only the python scared me a little bit when it jumped out from nowhere, which could have been upgraded as an impressive 3D set piece). The depiction of the three brothers' anecdote is definite the highlight, the scissor-cut cartoon creates an oriental impression and saves the film from the tiredness. <br/><br/>I wish I could watch it in an IMAX screen instead of just an ordinary one, but I noticed all the seats were occupied, I think this one will reach a new peak on the box office chart in China for Harry Potter series, maybe 300 million Chinese dollars is not a fool's paradise."

"VeeSixieme","7","0","0","25 November 2010"," Very good, but... well, it's not the book.
","I can't help being very strongly biased about this film; I am a huge fan of J. K. Rowling's original work. I felt so excited about my favourite story coming to the big screen that, as a true fan (in all the worst senses of the word), my judgement is impaired in two ways: I am both over-enthusiastic and extremely difficult to satisfy.<br/><br/>Let's be fair: it is a good movie, ""good"" meaning entertaining. You don't want to loose a second of it, and it really feels like a quarter of the actual runtime - but that might also just be my ""over-enthusastic"" side. The fact that I had watched all of the other Harry Potter films half a dozen times each in preparation for this one, and also that I knew the Deathly Hallows book almost by heart, made me enjoy immensely this opus, whether it'd be only out of ""newness"".<br/><br/>But, and maybe I am being less subjective here after all, it is not a film of great quality - nor were we to expect one. The idea of splitting the last HP in two is convenient (""Convenient? More like awesome!""), but this leaves the first part fairly empty in comparison to, say, the other HP films. Moreover, it has to try to compensate for all of the (plot)holes the other films had left it with. Those who haven't read the book would therefore find a lot of continuity mistakes that are difficult to forgive. Although most of the story is well-elaborated, suspenseful and imaginative, the lines are so much reduced to basics that you can't help the feeling that the screenplay must have been revised and rewritten a lot. Yet, we get a few extremely enjoyable moments - some funny, some sweet - every now and then.<br/><br/>As for the acting, well, we're only sorry to see so little of Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and company. But the main trio's acting skills have improved again, and although I still wouldn't hire them if I were to make a movie, I have to admit that they do their job all right (at least, as far as Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are concerned...). Very funny, also, to recognize their manners and mimics in the three older characters they are supposed to be impersonating.<br/><br/>All in all: it's not the book, but it's still magic :)"
"thegoodman-1","7","0","0","25 November 2010"," Brilliant film, but left me unsatisfied
","I've never been a massive fan of the Harry Potter series until recently and I only ever read about 2 or 3 of the books; so I'm not a die hard fan of the series, but i do enjoy the films a lot. I only recently finished watching the half blood prince too, so i wasn't sitting in a dark corner biting my nails waiting for this to come out, so i had no hype to disappoint me. I did however hear a lot about this film, after all, it was the first part in an epic grand finale and they definitely saved the best till last.<br/><br/>The film was brilliant - don't get me wrong - it was full of tension and edge of your seat excitement, but throughout the film I was constantly apprehensive. I was waiting for a massive moment that was going to shock the audience - something totally unexpected - I mean, after all, this is the final piece in a massive film series. So whilst I was waiting for something to happen, nothing really did. There was some bits that I'm sure hardcore fans would tell me otherwise and who probably cried in some of those scenes, but as a regular fan; nothing really major. Overall: fantastic film, but I feel there wasn't enough major moments."
"Christian_Dimartino","10","0","0","24 November 2010"," Just when I thought the Potter series couldn't get any better, a miracle occurs.
","It's been nearly a decade since the first Harry Potter film was released. The Harry Potter franchise is easily one of the most successful franchises in history.Having gone 7 films without a bad film, the series is drawing towards it's finale. With Harry Potter and the deathly hallows part 1 just being released, and part 2 to be released in July.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I didn't think the series could get better after films like The Half blood prince(my personal favorite), The Goblet of fire, and The Priosner of Azkaban. But after seeing The Deathly hallows Part 1, I was proved wrong. THe beginning of the end is off to a great start.<br/><br/>This one begins where the last one left off. And from the beginning of this, you can tell nothing is going to be the same. This isn't kids stuff anymore. Harry,Ron, and Hermione(Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) set off to find Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes(a.k.a. pieces of his soul) in order to defeat him. While Voldemort(Ralph Feinnes) and his evil team(including Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Jason Issacs, and Tom Felton) take over the wizarding world.<br/><br/>Each Potter film has been better by each one. The newer ones are better for one main reason:They are soooo dark. I knew after seeing The Goblet of fire that this whole ""Earwaxed flavored jelly beans stuff"" is a thing in the past. These movies are really grim,and actually sort of scary. And really evil.<br/><br/>That's a great thing abut the Potter series. This is the first film in which all of the side actors(such as Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Issacs) get something to really do. This is also the first film in which I actually felt for the characters. The three main actors really do terrific jobs.<br/><br/>The side actors are great too. Especially Helena Bonham Carter's evil,evil Bellatrix Lestrange. She's a menacing bitch, as she has been in every film. There is one scene where she really shines,when she's interrogating Hermione. She is really scary.<br/><br/>This is also the most heartfelt. There is a scene that Radcliffe and Watson share where they dance. Though it's kind of random, it's sweet. This is also the most epic,and most gripping, and the most powerful, and the most exciting. And it still sticks to what Harry Potter is all about... magic.<br/><br/>The friendship between the three friends has always brought the series together. I'm curious about one thing: If Part 1 was so good, I wonder how good part 2 will be? I loved this film. I think it's one of the years best. I will warn you though: If you have never read a word of Harry Potter or seen any of the films, you will be lost. Well, i've done both. So I loved it. I think it's one of the years best. To sum it up: It's better than Twilight.<br/><br/>A"
"Ryan_MYeah","9","0","0","24 November 2010"," The darkest entry in the series so far, but by far the best since Prisoner of Azkaban.
","The film is based on the first half of the final book in the series by J.K. Rowling, so it's understandably incomplete. Not to sound too enthusiastic, but the movie is outstanding, and the best Potter film since Prisoner of Azkaban.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma ""The Standout"" Watson return as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. These three are trying to defeat the sinister, and malicious Lord Voldemort (Played by Ralph Fiennes), who sends his Death Eaters on a mission to find Harry, so that he may destroy him once and for all. Harry, with the help of his friends, tries to find, and destroy the remaining horcruxes, hidden objects that give Voldemort eternal life. As they try to uncover each of these objects, jealousy starts to arise between them, emotions are tested, and the mystery of a secret known as the Deathly Hallows is uncovered.<br/><br/>I'm normally not too vocal about censorship, but I personally wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of ten. The series that started with the family friendly Philosopher's Stone, has evolved into by far and away, the most tonally dark, and brutally violent entry in the series so far. This inspired ambition is thanks to director David Yates, who holds the record for directing the most feature film adaptations of the series. It's not only a great fantasy, but it works as an effective study of the character's hidden desires, and secret jealousies. The movie at times feels slow, but slow pace aside, the movie is totally enrapturing, none the least of which is a terrific animated segment explaining the origin of the Deathly Hallows, right up to the film's heart stopping finale, comparable to the brilliant cliffhanger ending of The Two Towers, that leaves me so excited to revisit the film.<br/><br/>The film's main cast, that include Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Gambon, Fiennes, Coltrane, Rickman, Carter, Felton, and Staunton are back in top form, and most are better than ever, specifically the three children, who have come a long way over the past ten years, and deliver truly adult and complex performances. These returning members are helped out by great newcomers such as Bill Nighy, and Rhys Ifans, who clearly enjoy playing their characters, despite short screen time.<br/><br/>Such a dark entry in the series like this is nothing if not for the brilliant tech crew. The visual effects artists provide brilliant work, Stuart Craig's production design is darker, and grimmer than ever, the brooding cinematography by Eduardo Serra is right on the money, and the subtle mostly strings score by Alexandre Desplat is the best non-John Williams score for the series, and compliments the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The only flaw is making us wait eight months for the last installment, but since such a day will be bittersweet at best, I'm content on waiting as long as possible to see it all conclude.<br/><br/>I give Deathly Hallows Part 1 ***1/2 out of ****"
"EmoryThomas","10","0","0","24 November 2010"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1: Captivating
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is absolutely spellbinding; a full-blown fantasy epic with the magic, heart, and characters we have come to love over the last decade's worth of Harry Potter films. However it is a different world. For our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione are no longer bound to the safe haven Hogwarts once provided, but are on the run, trying to find the Horcruxes to defeat Voldemort.<br/><br/>Dan, Rupert, and Emma have never been better, and Rupert especially manages to project genuine anguish and emotion into the audience, something we have not seen from him before. Emma Watson has always been in my opinion the strongest of the three, and its no different here. You can't teach the way she delivers lines and between her and Toby Jones as Dobby, the two of them steal the show. That's not to say that Daniel Radcliffe was not a standout as Harry. He carries the film quite well as our reluctant hero, and manages to convincingly pull off some very tense moments in the film. Ralph Fiennes as always is terrifying as the Dark Lord, even with his limited screen time, and Helena Bonham Carter is Bellatrix Lestrange (notably in the final few scenes which get quite crazy). This franchise really has casted better than any I've seen in quite some time. <br/><br/>The special effects as always are breathtaking, with many enthralling action sequences throughout, with some noteworthy cinematography from Eduardo Serra. The nature and scenery shots are absolutely beautiful and the darker, greenish tints play quite nicely with the film's mature tone. On that note this truly is the darkest film by far. Violence and gore is seen throughout, as well as some more adult themes, and the little ones should be cautioned. That being said, if your family has grown up with Harry Potter, then it should be no problem.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, this film adapts the book incredibly well, probably the best since Chamber of Secrets, due to its splitting of the final book. Some have criticized the film as being slow in the middle because of the camping scenes. I have to disagree with these critiques however, for it moved quite nicely, and every scene had information relevant to the plot. Fans of the books will be incredibly excited by the attention to detail portrayed in this ""Potter"", and the subplots included. David Yates has finally directed the film that will please both the die-hard fans and the casual moviegoer. All of the films have been masterfully done, but I am aware as a fan of the books, that some fans have been slightly disappointed by the adaptations of the last two films. That being said I was extremely satisfied by this film as both an adaptation and prelude. I do feel like this film will be especially fun to watch back to back once Part 2 comes out, which I can not wait for. If you have not seen the previous movies, or read the books, do not bother with this movie. You will not enjoy it more than likely, and be confused beyond reasonable doubt. Overall this film is absolutely mind-blowing, and now my favorite of the films that were previously Goblet of Fire and Prisoner of Azkaban. And yet, it is only half the journey. For the epic finale awaits in July, and as we draw nearer to the close of our beloved boy wizard, one can only wonder if the magic will ever really end?....."

","This movie was really well done. I loved the editing, the music, the acting, the costumes, and set pieces. I would highly recommend this movie. The ending was really sad and dramatic. The script was really well done. the director was excellent. Helena Bonham Carter was the best. Emma Watson did a fantastic job. The pace of the movie was not too rushed. They adapted the book very well. It's to his great credit that Yates can keep these slow-paced scenes captivating and then easily switch to the comfort of a well-timed joke or intense action scene. Despite an emphasis on these characters being lost, both directionally and spiritually, Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 is still a movie that knows how to have fun. It just always mixes in the thrills with the sorrow. You can have a high-speed broom chase, but not everyone will make it out unscathed. You can have a funny and thrilling heist scene, but there will be the undertones of Nazi Germany. It's a movie where a scene can begin with someone getting flushed down a toilet and end with a critical injury and yet somehow it all works."

","While watching movie, in few places I had doubts about this movie. Not that movie ain't great, but that many scenes that were actually important to movie story were cuted out and few that actually don't matter nothing were included. Take example of Kreacher's story, and the scene when Harry and Herimiona dance in the tent (actualy, that scene is never written in book). So, what's more important ?! To see their knowledge of dancing, or to understand Kreacher's life (actualy, when Kreacher crush down on the ground of being overwhelmed with happiness was one of most emotional scenes in the book). That's one minus. Then, the story about entering the Ministry was, softly said, terrible. I mean, in one moment they realize that they should go to Ministry, and in then they're there ... However, when we throw away these few misleads in movie, we get one great movie that warms us for epic finale that will cast out the mightiness of the Harry Potter to maximum. Still, I'm a bit afraid of the things they might throw away in second part. <br/><br/>Movie doesen't follow the book at every way, which is a bit disappointing if you ask me (no matter if movie would be 3hrs, every fan of Harry Potter would watch it and eat every word - and I seriously doubt that they had money problem), but act in the movie was really great, so as the effects were (not that there are really much of them, but personally I liked that flight-fight scene, no matter that even that scene was cuted out a bit), and there were some moments when you could really laugh no matter that you know that that will happen. <br/><br/>After seeing the end of the first part, which came too fast (I mean, they put 500 pages into 143 minutes, by cutting out some main parts of book and adding some really crappy scenes), I realize that movie wasn't that bad; however, my hope still lies in second part, which I hope will be like ""really-really better"". Last 200 pages of book wouldn't be hard to put in some 2h'n 30min movie, but we will see.<br/><br/>Waiting June 2011 with hope beyond known; Harry Potter franchise will end like it deserves : Epicaly !"
"u992491","7","0","0","24 November 2010"," Faithful remake of the novel
","An accurate portrayal of the book, this movie warrants two parts to cover the ground of detail omitted in the previous films; especially the cat-vomit adaption of Half Blood Prince.<br/><br/>Having said that, I did have some grievances: 1. Annoying hand-held camera work. This sort of narrative doesn't suit it and it's not consistent with others in the series.<br/><br/>2. Stilted dialogue, (Yate's trademark). It seems that the 3 central characters can't have a simple conversation with each other - even when something significant happens and they NEED TO TALK. Harry should be sharing his visions, his wand's weirdo behaviour, etc; instead he's slow dancing with Hermione.<br/><br/>3. The ending. The movie ends when Voldermorte acquires the wand and Harry burries Dobby. I'd rather it end where Ollivander explains the elder wand and the continuing connection between Voldermorte and Harry's wand, highlighting the significance of Voldermorte's pursuit of the Elder. I think this ending departs with an additional layer of meaning, giving the audience something to digest for the next film, and would've been a better way to conclude a segue ending.<br/><br/>For any HP book loyalist, this movie won't disappoint. The only thing left to do now is remake the travesty that's Half Blood Prince."

","There are a lot of viewers out there that may look at this film and decide that is was a little boring and drawn out. Well, if you're a Harry Potter fan and watch this film in the context of all the others in the series, hopefully you'll appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>I can say that there was more story line than computer generated wizardry, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There was still enough action sequence to make this an enjoyable film for a variety of audiences and it certainly appealed to a more mature audience compared to its predecessors. <br/><br/>The majority of the movie has a dark overtone to it and this results in much dire consequences for some of the characters involved in the action. Since the setting has been taken out of wizard world of Hogwarts and has been placed in the real world, the movie makes a stronger connection to the audience.<br/><br/>The only thing I felt this movie could have included more of is the development of the personal relationships between the characters. Though there were some scenes that did push these stories along, the movie did little to give finality to many of the questions the audience has had since the beginning regarding ""who ends up with who"".<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great movie that added deeper tones, drew in newer audiences, and brought the series closer to home. It also certainly did what it was intended to do which is to set up the final showdown."

","The six previous Harry Potter films were good in their own right, however part one of the seventh installment is director David Yates's masterpiece (since he took over the series with The Order of The Phoenix in 2007). Yates targets a more adult and grown up audience in this film, however, it is a very familiar audience and gives the original fans of the series a more contemporary film that has developed with its fans themselves. Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson's acting talents have matured after being together for so many films creating flawless chemistry. They help create an entirely different dark and evil atmosphere. The film delves deep into the realms of while inserting the comedic antics along to lift the audience up along the way. Therefore, leave the kids at home and prepare for the series' best chance for an an heard of best picture nomination. Yates sets the tone of the film right away with the words of Bill Nighy's character Rufus Scrimgeour, ""These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today."" This is a very important statement and follows Harry, Ron and Hermione on their journey to destroy the Horcruxes and discover the Deathly Hallows to the films heroic somber conclusion opening up the evil realm in which Part 2 will be encapsulated in.<br/><br/>David Yates rallies his young actors in the film and has inspired them to give the best performances of their careers. It is obvious that experience has grown within them and has been passed down to these young actors by a very well known, experienced and talented supporting cast including Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix), Alan Rickman (Snape), Bill Nighy (Rufus) and Brandon Gleeson (Mad Eye Moody). The cast's talent is driven by a very successful and thought out adaptive screenplay by Steve Kloves that captures both the magic and the emotion of JK Rolling's novels. The visuals in the film are the best of the series flawlessly bringing the book to life. Yates exploits this because he was able to make the film follow the book the best out of all of the previous films because he had two films to do it. Characters have been developed to a whole new level in the film allowing one of the littlest characters Dobby the house elf to own the screen. Dobby is captured perfectly on film as the bad ass that was undersold in the books. All of this helped to create the cinematic Harry potter triumph, but it is the ending of the film where the film shines the brightest. The series has become apart of many people's lives and is viewed as a part of reality. Therefore the ending the film places the audience in the middle of the anguish the characters feel and even fans who already know how the story ends will be cheering nonetheless to see how Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 ends.<br/><br/>The film only tells half of the final Harry Potter story causing the audience to wait until July 2011 to see the story's emotional conclusion. Two tickets are needed several months apart to see the entire five plus hour conclusion. This is no longer a family movie, therefore, children need to be left at home while viewing this deep metaphorical journey. Also, in order to see this film and understand what is going on it is necessary to see the six previous films or have read the books. Failure to do this will leave you dazed and confused because even though this is the best of the films it relies heavily on the foundation that the previous films have built.<br/><br/>Even though the film only tells half of the story leaving you wanting more, do not let this fool you because you will be fulfilled. Go see it now and let Dobby show you what house elves can do and prepare yourself for the second part of the epic finale."

","These past 3 years with David Yates has been a roller-coaster ride. He's had his high moments, and then most of the time he's had his low moments. OTP was a decent movie, HBP was more of a romantic comedy than a harry potter movie, but with the deathly hallows part 1 Yates hits the nail straight on the head and brings in the emotion and story that the last two have been missing.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes for me were the most emotionally powerful. they showed how each of our three heroes are risking it all to save the world from voldemort's clutches. some say that the beginning dragged a little bit. but i thought it was perfectly paced. even though some spots were a little rushed, for example, the wedding sequence, but that was just to save time for the huge middle section of this epic movie. now the middle had some of my favorite scenes in the movie even though there wasn't that much wand waving involved, and it also provided some of the best performances of the movie. one scene in particular was the Hermione and harry dancing sequence, even though it wasn't in the book it was an absolute breath of fresh air and happiness in this other wise dark and foreboding world. godrics hollow was very well done and so was dobby's death. <br/><br/>All in all harry potter and the deathly hallows is not only yates' best movie to date, but it is the most emotionally powerful of all of the potter films"

","Harry Potter, who doesn't know the name Haryy Potter? Truth be told the powers that be could throw out any old garbage film and we the helpless fans would jump upon it and go in our thousands. Thankfully that hasn't happened.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hollows is a fine novel, one every fan should read and the film part 1 is true to the book and every fan will like it. It stars off with the brilliant "" 7 Harry's "" scene which is fantastic and from there it moves swiftly to the wedding and familiar faces are plentiful. We get to meet all the old favourites Mad Eye,The Weasleys,Lumpkin,Hermoine,Hagrid and of course Harry then we see the warm Weasley families home and all is OK, alas our blood thirst is quenched.<br/><br/>But the problem is after the start the film hits a dead end. We are left with the three main characters in isolation and not much else is going on. This is part of the story and necessary but to be blunt it is a little boring. However the last 30 minutes bring the tale back to life and do more than enough to excite the audience. The film as you all know is a little darker and perhaps more suitable for the 12+ age group.<br/><br/>All in all this is a decent film and is more than enough to keep the Potter Heads out there happy.

","Harry Potter was always a hit and miss franchise (at least in movie format) however what it lacked in being technically 'good' it was always fun and filled with enough excitement that it instilled a sense of magic within me. Deathly Hallows part 1 however seriously failed to meet my expectations. The film starts off with and awesome shot of Bill Nighy promising magic and fun and a battle between teen wizards and the gestapo, what we get however is 2 hours of extremely slow paced plot dabbled with wizarding fights. Don't get me wrong I LOVED some of the parts though the parts that I did love were so few and far between that at times it seemed like a chore to watch. I understand that this film was setting up everything for part 2 and that they wanted to split the book into 2 fairly lengthy films BUT this really wasn't necessary if it meant losing the thrilling nature of the film. I would've been perfectly happy to sit through 3 hours of fast paced frivolity compared to 2 hours of dribble that MAYBE will pick up in part 2.<br/><br/>As always my respect for Daniel Radcliffe flies out the door the moment he opens his mouth. If you were expecting great acting from the guy then I seriously pity you. That being said there was some STUPENDOUS acting from Rhys Ifans, Ralph Finnes, Alan Rickman and Bill Nighy. They stopped at no expense to get the best English actors in this film to play supporting roles. Throw Daniel Day-Lewis into the mix and I would've forgiven everything else about the film and given it a 10/10.<br/><br/>I seriously hope that part 2 does live up to the fast paced thrill ride that the rest of the series has been, If not then Part 1 has completely gone to waste.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I can only give this film a better than average. 6.5/10"

","I've seen all of the Harry Potter films and read the first 3 books. Going to the films has been a big movie event for us ever since the first one was announced all those years ago. I really enjoyed the first couple of ""innocent"" romps.<br/><br/>For my money though - and I have to say this - Rowling had no way to foresee the immense success of the first couple of books. They are fun, fresh and you want to find out more - so you keep reading/watching. Then it started getting serious - and a worldwide audience grew and required satisfaction. This is where the writer began to search for deeper issues, more complexity, more ""poke"". The plot lines begin to get stretched deep and moody, the author is trying to get to things which she never anticipated ever having to write about, because she never thought there would ever be any demand for any later works. She tries hard with the elemental Good Vs Evil thing and through interesting characters and connections manages to get to the 4th book out. I put Book 4 down because the whole concept had run its course by then. I didn't need to read anymore.<br/><br/>Book/Film 4 is the point where my patience wears thin. So you can imagine that by this film I'm going along because Harry Potter films have become a habit - they have punctuated my life.<br/><br/>I didn't really enjoy this film - it's not there to be enjoyed. It's a bleak, dark, thankless watch which has not one jot of the joy and fun of the early works. Sure - there's a war, sure, the badies are winning, sure - our heroes don't look so bright and shiny now that they don't really know what they are doing. But I found that I hardly cared; I wanted to, but I didn't.<br/><br/>I'm assured that the film is very true to the book; and this film will satisfy devotees of the books (like my wife...). But it just didn't do it for me. I watched it as someone who has seen all the films and felt the need to watch this out of a sense of completeness. I'm not going to say I was disappointed - I like the screen Harry Potter and want to see how he and his friends develop and perform as characters. Given the content I don't think that the film could have been any different to how it was; I just wanted it to be better somehow."

","I chose to go and see this on a cold damp Tuesday evening because I remember a bad experience watching the previous Harry Potter last year. I foolishly went on the Saturday of the opening week and the cinema was packed. It wasn't until the interval that I finally managed to threaten the teenager behind me enough to stop him kicking my seat all through the second half. But that was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away¬Ö I must take some of my pills. Here's a very brief summary before I tell you what I thought of this one (summary haters please hide the chosen one in a forest while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Lord Voldemort and his followers have taken over the Ministry of Magic and are hot on the trail of Harry Potter. Those loyal to him try to move him to a safer location, but they are betrayed and some of their number are killed or injured. After a further attack Harry, Ron and Hermione escape and decide to go it alone. They have discovered that one of the remaining Horcruxes is at the Ministry. Posing as three of the members of the Ministry they manage to steal the Horcrux, but have no way of destroying it. In his will, Dumbledor has left each of them an item that could help. Harry has been bequeathed the snitch he captured in his first game of quidditch as well as the Sword of Gryffindor which is currently lost. Hermione discovers that it is possible that the Sword could destroy the Horcrux. A mysterious light leads Harry to the sword and they are able to destroy the Horcrux. There a three more to be found and Lord Voldemort is becoming more and more powerful as time goes on. I have missed an awful lot out, but those are the salient points and, I hope, very few (if any) spoilers.<br/><br/>As we have come to expect, this is a beautifully made film, although much darker than the others. It was nice to see the three main characters out in the real world for a change. I love the animation that was used for the explanation of the meaning of the Deathly Hallows, beautifully done! Great performances all round, particularly from Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione. All are growing into fine actors.<br/><br/>As you may notice from reading my summary (assuming you weren't hiding in a forest), that a knowledge of all of the previous six episodes does help when watching this instalment. I did find it a bit hard to get into at first, but was soon enthralled again. The scenes in the ministry did remind me a little of Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil and there are more than hits of 'The Lord of the Rings' throughout. Over all, a very good film and one I heartily recommend.<br/><br/>My score: 8.3/10"

","David Yates really wanted to try a new kind of Harry Potter, and the fact that Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't in school helped him, also that this is the last episode, so he's trying hard to make the best of it. They also cut it at a pretty good bit, it's cliff hanging, but it was the best they could do(they might want to make the final battle long, that's why they went far more than half of the book.<br/><br/>If you're a grown up and you're checking this review because you're children want to see it and you think it will be maximum action, don't think that, just please go and see it and you will probably realize you enjoyed it, of course you should now quite a lot of the story and should read the books(if you don't have done it already).

But Daniel Radcliffe didn't work well in this film according to me. I am not saying they should have changed Harry or something, (...wait a minute, what if they did!? I'd appreciate the movies a lot more, thats what! And so would a lot of others out there), but the book portrays Harry as someone who 'takes charge' from the moment he hears of the Hallows. But the movie doesn't show him coming to the sudden and ingenious conclusion that ""Hallows must defeat Horcruxes"" (one of the best moments in the book). Here is where the movie failed in my opinion. But the part preceding it, that was just magnificent. The Tale of the Three Brothers - truly a feast for the eyes. Do keep an eye out for that. Also that dance scene in the tent at the Forest? 1 word - Why??? And worst of all, they put that scene in place of the ""Potterwatch"" radio bit in the book.. Bad mistake. Honestly, had I gone in with an open mind I may have enjoyed the film more, but I just couldn't.. I am too attached to the books!

","So, here we are: the beginning of the end for the Harry Potter film series - and there are both good and bad things to say about this first part of the last story. The film's main flaw is that it drags a bit in certain parts (like the portion in the Ministry of Magic, and a few individual scenes besides that) and makes you wish the characters would get on with whatever they're doing: some more editing definitely wouldn't have gone amiss. Meanwhile, some other parts, like Dumbledore's background and Grindelwald, are covered minimally, which may be confusing for someone who hasn't read the book.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are other scenes which are adapted brilliantly; examples include the hilarious scene with seven Harrys, the animated depiction of the Tale of the Three Brothers, and Ron taking on the locket Horcrux. As with the previous films, there are also some good bits where the filmmakers make up something of their own rather than adapting directly from the book, such as the very effective opening of the film, and a nice little dance scene between Harry and Hermione. There's a generally dark atmosphere, and a sense of unease and unfamiliarity that comes with the main characters no longer being in the familiar setting of Hogwarts, which is all to the good for this story. And just about every actor in the cast does their absolute best: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are perhaps better than they have been in any of the previous films.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 isn't the best of all the Potter films, but it has some great moments, and does its job by setting the scene for what promises to be an epic climax."

IT supposed to be a fantasy and they make it somehow a twilight which does not really compliment the movie.<br/><br/>Having said that ron and hermione really pull strings on the acting bit, harry was a little bit of but it was overall good.

","I was impressed as always with the film itself but it could have been cut down to a much shorter film. The layover in the different locations got a bit boring. I'm guessing without doing any exact timing it could have been cut down to at least under 2 hours. I'm hoping the final part will have a bit more action and less milling around. I would rather sit through a three to four hour single part film then have to wait 8 months for the final part. The old epic films when we'd sit through a 3¬Ω hour film with an intermission would be perfect for this finale. They could have combined both parts, made it in 3-D and had a brief intermission.<br/><br/>And I definitely agree with the person that said, don't bring the kids. The series has gotten darker since movie #5. The cast and film has grown up in years as should the viewers. I would not bring my grade school child but someone who saw Part 1 as a youngster would appreciate it more now some 10 years later. Can't wait for the final film, hoping for a good follow-up and watching both parts on blu-ray in a year or two."

","To begin I have not followed with the series of Harry Potter movies that have come out since ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" in 2001, but I was fascinated with this newest edition to the series ""The Deathly Hallows"" mostly from what others had been saying and the idea that the film would be split into two parts. So after deliberation, I went and saw the movie. To be fair, I did enjoy the film, from start to finish I was intrigued by the events that transgressed and began to get an understanding of the characters. I was a little slow in understanding the plot of the movie but gradually got a small idea as to what was happening. The actors all do a fair job with their roles and character development was one of those moments where the writing truly impressed me. The foreboding scenery and visuals aided to enhance the seemingly hopeless plight of the characters and some of the dialogue further added to the mood of the film. However, I do have to say that the film really isn't the same for one who first comes into the series. One really must have seen some of the other films to truly grasp what's going on in this one. There were times when I thought that I knew what was happening in the story but then quickly began to question myself after something else happened. Sometimes I couldn't really understand the dialogue and that left me feeling a little confused, which persisted throughout the film. In conclusion I have to say that ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" while entertaining, was just alright to me. For those who have seen the other movies might think that this movie is great, but I just didn't get that same feeling. However, I will say that the film did get me interested in the series just from seeing this film and I can safely say that I am looking forward to seeing part 2."

But, like Ebert, I like to review the movie as a single entity, by itself.<br/><br/>Secondly, I can answer some of my own question by saying ""Yes, this is a prequel to the main, movie, which will be Part 2."" That offers some conciliation but not too much, no.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was boring. Long and boring (please see disclaimer #2). Acting has gotten a little better so has the script. There were a couple of ""action"" moments but alas not enough to carry the movie.<br/><br/>Another gripe I had was because of their accents, MOST of the names (places and people) they were saying were completely unintelligible. (See disclaimer #1)<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm waiting for Part 2 as well."

","I don't take my family to the movies very often -- too expensive. But we've gone to see the new Harry Potter movies since the second one. I wish I had been warned about this one. In the scene where Ron is about to destroy the locket, and he sees Harry and Hermione taunting him, then kissing, all of a sudden they are both naked, caressing, and making out. I was horrified, embarrassed, and totally furious. I go to reasonable lengths to keep pornography away from my family, and there it was on the big screen in a Harry Potter movie! Unbelievable. It may have been only a few seconds long, but those few seconds ruined the whole movie for me. I'm done with those movies."

","Saw a screening last night, I thought it was good. It has a few laugh out loud moments. There's also a few boring moments where nothing seems to be happening just to build tension I guess.<br/><br/>I think the filmmakers intended that the viewers had all read the book recently. I had only read it once, when it first came out, and apparently had forgotten a lot, so there were many parts where I wasn't quite sure what happened or was happening...<br/><br/>Also a few bits seem unrealistic. And obviously that's kinda a dumb thing to say about a movie about magic... but I won't list them as this is a non-spoiler review."
"InaneSwine","10","2","5","18 February 2016"," A perfect quiet before the storm
","You'd be forgiven for questioning whether this was a Potter movie after all. No Maggie Smith, no floating candles, no Quidditch - we never even set foot inside Hogwarts. But believe me - we get a Potter movie like you've never seen.<br/><br/>Most of the visual magic takes place in the first act, as we're treated to a batch of Polyjuice Potion, a Wizard wedding and a rather spectacular chase sequence on a flying motorbike. But for the main chunk of the film, Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is a character study, plain and simple. Supported by beautiful landscapes and top-notch cinematography, the film focuses almost exclusively on our three heroes as they travel far and wide in their search for an answer to what is turning into a full-scale war.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows goes to places not previously explored, particularly given the franchise's lighter beginnings under the guidance of Chris Columbus, as we now tackle heavy issues of racism, ethnic cleansing, slavery and Rowling's magical interpretation of Nazism. The style and atmosphere is reminiscent of post-apocalyptic fiction and cosy-catastrophe concepts worthy of H.G. Wells or John Wyndham. The icing on the cake would be Ben Hibon's superbly animated ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", one of the finest sequences in the entire franchise. As if that weren't enough, we also get perfectly timed blends of horror, romance and, finally, tragedy.<br/><br/>Aside from a few niggling points that only a reader of the book could complain about - maybe Harry's farewell to the Dursleys was too rushed - the film is a wonderfully atmospheric prelude, a tight interpretation of its source material, and a perfect quiet before the storm."

","I have seen all movies in the series. I should of stopped watching after the extremely boring Half Blood Prince. The Deathly Hollow made no sense once so ever. Half way through the movie I stopped caring about what was going to happen next. I have seen thousands of movies and never have I seen a movie that I could not make sense out of like this one. It was just one random scene to the next, never explaining anything. Forgive me, this is my first review. For the first time I feel it necessary to tell someone how bad this movie is. There is no way that I am going to see the conclusion. No even if it was free. Please don't waste your time and money on this one."
"TobinTelleran","5","2","5","29 November 2010"," If only the leads were trained actors
","Stayed very true to the book as far as I can remember it. The actors have all grown up but still don't really feel like pros. This really showed in this film.<br/><br/>I would have to say the main reason for this would be that in the previous movies it really felt that they were checking boxes for what they had to achieve to make the movie make sense and to cover the required material from the books. This achieved two things. The action was generally quite high and also keep the plot moving.<br/><br/>In the Deathly Hallows Part One this was not the case at all. For the first time we really had a chance to see the characters develop and react to what was going on around them. Harry, Hermoenie & Ron didn't rise to the challenge here. I really think that if a 'real' actor had been in their place, say Dakkota Fanning, than we could have really got inside these characters heads. This made it drag a little and the tension kept being broken.<br/><br/>Apart from that this was an enjoyable film."

Acting, special-effects and crucially the storyline were all probably better than ever. You could watch this film again and again and it would never get boring - honestly, I would say that it was quite possibly the best of all the films so far,and I cannot wait for the next one :)<br/><br/>Also, Voldemort has never been so terrifying :')"
"alvispotter-1","10","2","5","18 November 2010"," I never thought it could still get this much better! Best in the series and my favorite of all times
","As it is obvious from reading my review title, i am a huge Harry Potter fan and i have been since its inception. I have loved all the books and all of the films (yes, i have, but there's no doubt i like some more than others)and have gotten impressed with how good the films became in Yates hands (i loved Newell, but Yates is my top choice right up cuaron). The fifth one was amazing even with all the material that had to be cut, and Half Blood Prince turned out my favorite film not only in the series but in the whole world (and i do watch a lot of good films, but nothing can beat my love for HP). <br/><br/>Taking all that into consideration and also considering that my favorite book was Deathly Hallows and that i've been waiting on every HP fan page for the last year and a half, this film: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 completely exceeded perfectly my expectations and topped them by a million times. There was not a minute of the film i did not love seriously, and i just cant get over the shock of the film.<br/><br/>There are uncountable reasons why this film quickly became my favorite. First of, i think that splitting the last book in two parts was the best idea EVER, and i actually think we all win, and furthermore, we all won. The filmmakers will make much more money and all the fans all over the world will be much happier and much less disappointed with the films because they would be able to include much more from the grand and epic finale. And i think I'm not the only one when i say that that's exactly what happened. It is my favorite film not only because it's incredibly true to the first half of the book, but because it was done perfectly well in my opinion. Im definitely going to see it 3 or 4 times more because it was really amazing, so that's where the filmmakers win. But i want to make clear that it is impossible that the filmmakers made such a nice film if they didn't care of the fans, so not only do they care of the cash but of the fans as well, which is an honor. I loved from the beginning to end. So if you have sticked with my review, you can see that i LOVED the film like few other things, and believe it or not, it wasn't just only because i am a huge potter fan, but because the film was incredibly done: the cinematography was superb (congratulations Eduardo Serra, you nailed the landscapes and the whole angles throughout the film, bravo), the editing was pretty good (even though i know your hate for mark day), the score was pretty nice fitting (i still prefer hooper's HBP and Williams POA, but it is my third favorite and it was incredible. Desplat you did great, and if it is true you are already on board for part 2, I'm very happy, even though i cant deny i would have loved Williams), the visual effects were perhaps the best in the series (and i believe this time they can get the Oscar for that), the acting from the trio is undoubtedly THE BEST IN THE SERIES, they totally stepped up their game and just acted amazingly throughout the film; the adult cast was amazing as usual, and i loved Ralph's performance more than before, and i loved Rhys ifans and the guy who play mundungus, and Toby Jones, and however briefly snape, and Helena and pretty much everyone, but i want to congratulate hugely to Rupert and Emma (especially Rupert who was also hilarious) for their amazing performance... The sets were great (nicely done Stuart Craig), the costumes, make up, SCRIPT (congratulations Kloves) were incredible, but most of all i want to congratulate Yates, who gave a more than superb directing, not only being hugely HUGELY faithful to the book, but making the story flow in an amazing way. I simply cant imagine any other director doing these last films, and I'm happy as hell you are doing them. So as you can see, both fan review and movie review, i loved the movie, and i have no doubt is one of my favorites in the world (again, i watch tons of good film, but HP is unbeatable for me). I know this review is hugely long but it is because i loved the film and i cant stop saying so. I actually thought it would be hard to top Half blood prince, but hell it did.... Yates just keeps getting better and better. So once again, thank you filmmakers (especially Yates) for making this perfect film for me and i guess for may others out there. But thank you JK Rowling for creating such a master book in which they could make this awesome film. I recommend it with all my heart and my passion of films. The non readers will love it for how amazingly paced it is and the story, and the readers believe me that you wont be disappointed AT ALL with the film and it might become your favorite. I know it is a huge shot, but i can see this film getting a good shot with technical awards at the Oscars, and maybe a nom for best film. 10/10. Just a perfect film. And needless to say how excited i am for part 2, and how devastating it will be when it is all over."
"Xillx","4","2","6","21 November 2010"," Huge improvement, from horrible to mediocre
","Previous movies were a complete waste of talent and totally ruined the story. But by separating the last novel in 2 movies, they now have the chance to mess up twice as more scenes.<br/><br/>While a few of the scenes are somewhat true to the book (explaining my 4 rating), the rest feels cheap. Why remove the drama? When HP is denied the sword at the beginning, why does he stay with a bland stare instead of getting angry and defying the Minister like in the book? Was that too complicated? Like: - ""Ok now you will have to act aggressively"" - ""act aggessrilevy? never heard of it, can I please just look at the wall there?"" That is a Huge change in his personality: In the book he has courage and can stand on his feet, in this movie he has a blank look more often than not, and dresses like a college geek. A sweatshirt? WTF<br/><br/>The sames goes for the initial scene, they do not even mention it's happening at the Malfoy's manor and why. Hell the first 30 minutes of the movie is like they tried to remake the book without words and with the actors expressing the least emotions as possible. The entire production falls apart. The scene in the Dursley's house feels like a bad theatre production.<br/><br/>And gosh the music, who's fault is it, the composer or the lousy director? I have a feeling it's more the director.<br/><br/>This movie series will all have to be redone properly."
"nikhilesh-v","6","2","6","20 November 2010"," Slow Good but Greedy Move
","Another Harry Potter movie which is definitely much better than the book! No offence to Ms. Rowling but her writing since the Goblet of Fire, lost its heat. The Deathly Hallows is a movie which should not have had another part. Its a money move by the producers which makes an otherwise good movie into a waste of time. The gore factor has been increased with also in increased dark-nature to the movie line. The movie's first half seemed like it was there just to fill in the 146 minutes of Runtime and it was horrendously boring. If this wasn't a money train people would've easily made the movie into 1 part. The acting as usual is beyond sucky, with no expressions other than 0.o by all the actors except for Ralph Fiennes. One time watch in your Cinema hall. I wouldn't recommend the 3D version as the normal one gives one a headache as itself. Fanboys need to look at the movie without bias."
"tmansonster","10","2","6","19 November 2010"," Holy Hallows!! Get Thee To An IMAX
","This film was made for IMAX. It is at times visually breathtaking, emotionally excoriating, sublimely beautiful, majestic in scope and ambition, subtle as silk, and acutely funny. Most of all the emotional and visual experience in IMAX is often hair-raisingly and deeply visceral.<br/><br/>Rickman, Fiennes, Watson, Radcliffe, Bonham-Carter, Isaacs, Felton, Ifans, all have scenes in which within the space of no more than a few seconds you go on an emotional roller coaster involving anything from anxiety, fear, self-pity, psychotic outburst, to resignation and back again.<br/><br/>Once more Emma Watson is the emotional centre of the film, in one scene with Radcliffe her emotional range is genuinely awe inspiring, with only the big screen doing it, and the torture scene, and so many others, justice. Rupert Grint is at long last allowed to be three dimensional, and Radcliffe proves just how subtle an actor he is, dominating the screen in the best all-round performance to date.<br/><br/>Yates has got the best performances out of all the vast array of characters, but special mention has to go to newcomers Peter Mullan as Yaxley (raw intensity), Andy Linden as Mundungus (likeable rogue), Nick Moran (attractive predator), and David O'Hara, Sophie Thompson, and Steffan Rhodri as perfect polyjuiced potioneers playing Harry, Hermione, and Ron respectively.<br/><br/>The Ministry of Magic scenes are awesome in their scale and richness, the 7 Potters scene hilarious, and a sense of dread is sustained throughout the film. But in the end, for all its David Lean-like epic and visual qualities, it is the trio that give this film its heart and soul. Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Daniel Radcliffe, are formidable actors who can now be genuinely given proper credit for carrying this mind-boggling franchise to its conclusion."

","At the moment Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One is the lowest rated Potter movie on Rotten Tomatoes, and has gotten a poor reception from some of the top critics across the globe. Unfortunately for these self-satisfied critics who like nothing more than to hear the sound of their own bickering this movie wasn't made for them. This movie was made for the millions of Harry Potter fans who have reread the books and rewatched the movies dozens of times and who were ready to see the epic story of their hero come to an end. For them this movie is a masterpiece and that is why Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One is the best we've seen from the Potter Franchise to date.<br/><br/>The movie takes more lines verbatim from the book than any of its predecessors. Book fans will be smiling throughout as their favourite line gets its air time. And for the first time in Potter movie history people will not be leaving the theatre bitching about what wasn't in the movie. The decision to split the movie finally gave the filmmakers enough time to do the book justice. The slower moving pace of the movie may bore some, but really allows the characters to get their final payoff.<br/><br/>And of course these characters were the highlight of the film. Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have developed into three of the best young actors of our generation. Our favourite trio really flex their acting muscle during the fight between Harry and Ron, Harry and Hermione's walk through Godric's Hollow, and Hermione 's torture scene. For the first time we are away from Hogwarts and they cannot rely on the adult actors to pick up the slack, but they don't miss the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane one bit.<br/><br/>Director, David Yates, took a much more ""artsy"" approach to this film than they've had in the past making for some quite fantastic visuals. The animated ""Tale of the Three Brothers"" scene is beautifully done and really keeps you captivated throughout quite a long story which yet again is taken almost directly from the book. The panning scenery shots we see in this film add another layer of depth to this visual masterpiece.<br/><br/>Part One of the finale certainly does not pull any punches in the violence department between Bathilda's attack, Ron's splinching and the previously mentioned Hermionie torture scene. All of this leaves us wondering what surprises we could be in for during the much gorier and violent Part Two of the movie.<br/><br/>I couldn't finish this review without mentioning what is undoubtedly the saddest scene in a Harry Potter movie to date. If Dobby's death at the end doesn't have you tearing up you're probably Lord Voldemort... or at least had your soul ripped apart a few times.<br/><br/>Yes the movie leaves you on a hanging point, yes it wasn't 24/7 action, yes it didn't have the charm of the first few. But Deathly Hallows Part One had much more than that and if you're getting hung up on these details go join the critics who are bashing this movie and you can all get your hate on together because for the rest of us this movie is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>Rating: S-A-B-R-E +1 Check out our site at : Sabretoothmovies.blogspot.com"
"tolga-ismen-1","7","2","6","19 November 2010"," Beautiful but boring
","The problem of the Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is evident from the title: Part 1. There is no climax in the movie. The story is left inconclusive as it should be since it will be concluded in Part 2. I could understand if Part 2 will be released within 4 to 6 weeks so that we can watch them back to back. Now we will probably forget about the despair that the trio experienced and Part 2 will be baseless. The main problem of the all HP movies were the unclarity of the reason of the evil ones. I did not read any of the books but just watching the films I never got the mega plan of Valdermort. Why he was evil, why he was killing all these people? And more importantly why all these people are following him. Now we have a better idea. Valdermort is the Adolf Hitler of the wizards. But still, Hitler and Nazis had a socio-economic motive. We do not understand why these bad guys do not like the others. However, I must add this is a very beautiful movie. The scenes, the emotions and the character development is very successful. It feels more like a European art movie than a Hollywood blockbuster. This is a general trend. The story was also secondary in Avatar. You must watch the movie if you are familiar with the series but do not expect too much from the story. I really hope that the DVD will be available before Part 2 release so that we can refresh our mind before watching it. Finally, I believe the scene that Harry and Hermoine was making out was unnecessary and too graphic. This is still a children movie and it was too much for 7 year-old."

"garyvanb","7","1","2","21 November 2018"," Things Get Positively Dreary!
","The focus is on Harry, Hermoine and Ron, on their quest, with just a few scenes involving any others, and Valdemort is back, but still on the peripheral. And the three carrying around that horcrux as it sucks the life from them and makes them turn on each other is reminiscent of the One Ring from Lord of the Rings, and not the most entertaining time I've had watching a Harry Potter movie. Things are downright dour! This is a kid's film?
Still, it's not totally bad. The scenes with Valdemort show him to be a great villain, as he feeds one of the teachers to his snake, and the beginning has a thrilling sequence with a bunch of Harry Potter look-alikes, and the end, where Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lastrange tortures Hermoine and the elf Dobby shows up to save them all, but they pay a price, were also very good. But they're all like glowing lights in the midst of a very dismal and depressing darkness."
"MrBayren","4","1","2","22 August 2018"," Better late than never but it doesn't feel like I missed out on much.
","Not much to say really. Rather boring in general and containing lots of plot inconsistencies. I think the most disappointing thing is the magic or lack thereof I should say. Specifically when it comes to combat at least. I like all the trinkets and some of the spells are quite interesting but when it comes to fighting it's as plain as Hovis white bread. This is a magical world with limitless potential (to a degree) and there isn't a whole lot of creativity at all. It's basically as if they're all firing little magical crackers that knock people out. The worst offender was that chase scene through the forest, which was almost made me sick with its horrific camera shaking and random crackers being launch at trees. The deathly hallows items felt very tacked on but I assume that will be explored further in part 2. <br/><br/>The acting was not that great. Most of the cast was bordering on cheesy/bad, only some of the adults were more passable. The style might have fit better earlier on when it was more school time fun but this is becoming too serious for it to work. For me, the worst offence was how the mysteries were being unravelled without any work. There was a trend of cutting to a new location and having Hermione or Harry very conveniently happen upon a new clue that was sort of explained by some magical reasoning if we were given anything at all.<br/><br/>Overall can't say I hated it but I did start checking Reddit so you could say I was underwhelmed. I've heard Part 2 is much better so I'm hoping for quite the turnaround."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a film directed by David Yates. Since this was the second last instalment, my anticipation for this one was sky high. And after watching the film, I can say that that film exceeded all my expectations.<br/><br/>Plot: Harry, Ron and Hermione team up to destroy the secret to his immortality - Horcruxes.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film started the trend of the last part being split up to two films. But I can say without doubt that none have achieved the level of greatness that this film achieved. As I have stressed in the previous instalments, the character work in this film is just like no other film series. The makers know what the audience expects and just taps on to that. From the very first scene you know that the stakes are real and the setting itself made me worry for the safety of the characters. We have some amazing action sequences in the film which are very beautifully shot and nicely edited. The film mostly takes place between the 3 main characters of the film. And it never feels boring just to watch them doing what they are great at. Alexandre Desplat's score is just amazing. The sets and camera work for the film is beautiful. The VFX is the best the series has to offer. Some characters do suffer consequences and you do feel sad for them. The film does end in a cliffhanger but that will not disappoint as it is known the film will continue.<br/><br/>Performances: Daniel Radcliffe was great as Harry Potter. The emotional depth this character has is deep and you feel for him. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is just great. For the first time in the series, I felt the emotional side of this character. Rupert Grint successfully portrays a different side of Ronald Weasley. This film does introduce Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour. The role is small but good enough to leave an impression. Also introduced here is Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood. I did feel the role was good but a bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be a scene when Harry decides to cheer Hermione when she is sad by having a small dance with her. This scene showed the maturity and understanding these characters have for each other. I came to know from somewhere that this scene was nowhere in the book. So it is a big pat on the makers' back for innovating something new and presenting us in a good way.<br/><br/>Verdict: For a second last film in a franchise, this film does justice. It sets up scenes for what is about to come and makes us ready for some consequences that might not just be in our favour. Thanks again to David Yates, Steve Kloves and the entire team of Harry Potter for bringing us a franchise that knows how to treat a particular story with respect. I can't just wait for the final instalment.<br/><br/>I am going with a 10."

What are they? Where are they? Can they do it? What chance do they have? It's a race against time for our main heroes and time is not on their side.

","Harry, Ron and Hermoine fight against the dark forces while at the same time making all attempts at destroying the Horcruxes. The sharp entry and exit from the Gringotts gives goosebumps. The exit of Ron after strife and dramatic entry and destroying of horcrux add as complementary. The betrayal of Luna's father and sacrifice of Tobby are worth mentioning. The part ends with Voldemort gaining access to Elder wand and is supposed to be most powerful."

The First part of the Deathly Hallows movies works beautifully as a normal movie while being a fine addition to the Harry Potter movie series, though the movie changes the tone of the series dramatically as if the Goblet of Fire didn't do that enough. The movie does cram a lot into its running time, end in a cliffhanger and rely upon coincidences quite a bit but still manages to be a good movie because of the amazing acting and writing, making it a highly recommended movie."

I haven't read the books, but I can't believe that JK Rowlings would have written hundreds of pages of boring material with nothing happening. This movie lacks interest and could have been edited down to one hour of screen time for an extended version of both deathly hollows as one movie. I'm not impressed one bit by this 2.5 hour snore."

As I've said in all my reviews up to this point, I haven't read a single story in the series so I'm basically just watching the movies without the benefit of comparing them to anything. Whereas I thought the previous film was somewhat boring a long-winded, that certainly wasn't the case here and I ended up finding this one to be one of the best of the series.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this one is that there seemed to be a lot more emotion as the various characters are face some sort of battle against one another. There was a lot of inner fighting among the characters and I must admit that I was shocked to see how much I was caught up in the drama. There were a lot of scenes where Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were in some sort of drama and the actors perfectly sold it. In fact, to me Watson clearly stole the film here and managed to turn in her best performance.<br/><br/>Visually the film is quite impressive, although the special effects certainly aren't as in-your-face as the previous film. Technically speaking the movie is impressive with some great cinematography, a nice rousing score and of course there are some very good performances.

The film scored Academy Award nominations for its visual effects and art direction, but came short as always. Just no luck with the Academy for Potter.<br/><br/>Fans of the franchise will be shocked by the deaths of many (dear) characters such as Mad-Eye, Gobby or Hedwig here. As if it wasn't already enough that they had to deal with Dumbledore's demise. One of my personal highlights is the story of the three brothers in this movie. Apart from that I really liked Luna Lovegood who stole every scene she was in. Great actress Evanna Lynch and I really want to see more from her in the future. Her character of course isn't going to be Potter's girlfriend (that would be Ginny), but she's too cool for him anyway. Also her dad plays a big role this time. One of my favorite quotes from her is when she says that Potter does not want to talk to them right now, but is simply too polite to say. As mysterious as Draco's role is, the same goes for Snape. Or maybe not, as he is downright evil in this film and we won't find out the truth until the final chapter.<br/><br/>Another highlight would be when Ron, Harry and Hermione were in Britain's wilderness on their own. The central characters' tension, conflicts, but also the bonding are the biggest strength of this film and the harmonic dance sequence with Harry and Hermione is truly a thing of beauty with all the horrible messages pouring in through the radio. The maybe toughest scene to watch was Bellatrix torturing Hermione, also a contender for the whole franchise. It's kinda pointless to recommend or not recommend this film as, if you consider watching this, you have liked the earlier films anyway. I personally believe it is a pretty good film and builds up nicely to the 8th and last chapter of the hyper-successful Harry Potter franchise. Of course, it was also once again among the most commercially successful films of the year, but that's a given."

","Due to how the writer chose to end Part One, I was not so interested in seeing Part Two ... I did not return to the theater for the final episode of the Harry Potter series of film. Basically, if the writer would have been writing the story of Bambi, she would have killed off Flower, the skunk ... for which ceased my interest in anything she might do in the future. I sincerely hope that others share my opinion of the way this particular film ended! Basically, it pi$$ed me off big time ... and the DVD's are stored away, never to be watched again! Basically, you don't have a slave set free just to die an unheroic death! You don't kill off this character at all ... it just isn't done! Especially when the character becomes so cherished by one and all, including the audience! To kill off that character is nothing short of being nasty and wicked to the audience! As you can see ... it really played a number on my head, to the point that I would never trust this author again.<br/><br/>Second mistake ... which has to do with the cutting of the film, and not the writer. A scene was removed from the movie that should not have been! At the beginning, when Harry's Uncle, Aunt, and the brat are escaping by moving away ... the kid was suppose to approach Harry and basically make amends for all that he did to Harry ... the scene was cut, and it should not have been! The reason it should not have been is that the scene reinforced the fact that we need not be as our parents are ... we can be better! Cutting that out was a huge mistake! Well, there you have it ... I found this movie to be a huge disappointment."

I thought the film dragged on a bit too much and it didn't really engage me as much as the previous films. I think the camping with Harry,Ron and Hermione went on for too long. Although there was some good action in it. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's a bad movie however it certainly was one of the weaker ones. The acting was very good and it was another dark movie.

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a fantasy film that is directed by David Yates and the first of two cinematic parts that form the screen adaptation of the novel by J. K. Rowling. It is the seventh installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron and Rowling. The story follows Harry Potter on a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality ‚Äì the Horcruxes. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. It is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and is followed by the concluding entry, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2.<br/><br/>The first installment of the two-film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows follows Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they search for the pieces of Voldemort's soul that he extracted from his being and hid in obscure locations both far and wide. If the trio is unable to locate and destroy them all, Voldemort will remain immortal. Despite their long friendship, a combination of dark forces, romantic tensions, and long- held secrets threaten to sabotage the mission.<br/><br/>Deliberate, nervy sequel that wisely matures with the fan base. The deliberation and general caution of the picture is a perfect way to say good-bye to this amazing run of feature films.Also, the good outweighs the mediocre, so in the end this is one of the better installments in the series.Deathly Hallows: Part I is obviously a beautifully filmed, emotionally satisfying penultimate installment for the Harry Potter series."
"Mr_Jellyfish","7","1","2","24 November 2011"," A refreshingly surreal and dark blockbuster. Plenty of money has been thrown at this film, but it retains a sense of identity that is unmistakably British
","It will be no surprise to anyone that the latest instalment of Harry Potter is ""darker than the one before it"", but I certainly wasn't expecting such a pitch-black blend of melancholy, depression and horror- with a bit of sex thrown in. What the hell happened? One minute Potter is a scrawny little dork, getting into trouble in the enchanted school of Hogwarts, the next he's covered in the blood of his friends, a look of quiet acceptance on his face, as he prepares to die. I haven't been paying the utmost attention to the series, but I have at least seen every film once. If you haven't, don't even bother watching The Deathly Hollows, because no attempt will be made to bring you up to speed with the story so far. Instead you'll spend the entire film wondering why so many famous and much loved British actors keep popping up with just a handful of lines of dialogue between them. It is a curious thing, but ultimately good, that so much time is spent with the film's heroic trio while people like John Hurt, Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs and so, so many more (basically all the British actors) are left to hover around in the background, largely left out of focus.<br/><br/>There is a tangle of different plots that keeps the narrative going forwards, but they are of such simple design that the ideas never really bog you down. It's more a case of ""find the MacGuffin"" which is actually a refreshing change from the complicated relationships of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who all hate each other now apparently. The story itself is relatively linear; Harry and the team must find and destroy some pieces of evil Lord Voldemort's soul, which have been hidden away in keepsakes and scattered about (though usually found in locations that were important to the dark lord). There's also the Deathly Hallows themselves, which are explained in a rather lovely animation sequence, as three magical devices that, when combined, can defeat death itself. <br/><br/>Voldemort obviously wants to get his mittens on these Deathly Hallows, while the heroic trio are more concerned with finding a means to destroy an unbreakable locket, which contains a piece of his aforementioned soul. It's simple stuff, but allows for plenty of emoting on the kid's side, as the burden of their quest becomes too much to bear. Cracks begin to appear in their relationship, especially between Harry and Ron, while Hermione actually holds the gang together- although, it's fair to say, she is the source of most of the trouble. Indeed, this new instalment has a lot of sexual undertones- and at one point throws subtlety completely out of the window, when Hermione becomes a cold, hard dominatrix- possibly channelling Galadriel's temptation of the one Ring. Speaking of which, the new Harry Potter, like the majority of the previous instalments, borrows heavily from Tolkien lore, most notably with the corrupting power of Voldemort's locket, which the trio take turns in carrying round their necks. The locket is one of the primary contributing factors to the cracks in the trio's friendship, ratcheting up the tension and the melancholy in equal measure. While the film is host to many a famous face, the young stars; Radcliffe, Grint and Watson do an admirable job, their acting lending the fantasy a healthy injection of realism.<br/><br/>The kids are so normal, that at times they seem at odds with the overly camp, theatrical actors that prance around having immense fun with their limited roles. It is worth noting, however, that despite the apparently sombre look of the film, the spiky humour is consistent throughout, and there is an ample amount of surrealism that gives this film a particular shine. The infiltration of the Ministry of Magic is a stand out moment; equal parts disturbing and bizarrely humorous, drawing on great films like Terry Gilliam's Brazil for inspiration. Another wonderful scene is Harry and Hermione's trip to see Bathilda Bagshot, which is scarier than most of the horror film's out at the moment. <br/><br/>All in all, the film is dark, but funnier than the previous chapter's in the series. There are plenty of flaws, particularly if you find yourself unconvinced by the film's protagonists, who carry the story on their shoulders. There are plenty of clich√©'s, and the moments you wish would last longer are hurried along to make way for more scene's of Harry sitting around looking tired. However, the overall feel of the film, the darkness that must come before the light, is pretty powerful. If you allow yourself to be invested in the story and the characters, rather than approaching it with snooty cynicism, you will probably find yourself going along for the ride. <br/><br/>Children of a certain age may not understand a lot of what's going on, and will likely be terrified during the scary moments, which are often quite horrific, but chances are the people who have invested in this film have already grown up with the previous six instalments. If you are unfamiliar with the story so far, go back and watch the other films, or at least read the synopses on Wikipedia.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a good movie, there's plenty of exciting set pieces, sharp wit throughout and lots of time to develop the characters in interesting ways. Just remember that it is actually darker than you're expecting it ."

","I have grown up with ""Harry Potter"" and as preparation for the last film, which is going to be shown this week, I am going to be re-watching all of the previous films this week.<br/><br/>It is Harry's supposedly 7th year at school, but he chooses not to return to Hogwarts. Instead, he vows to set out to find and destroy all the Horcruxes, with his friends, Ron and Hermione. As the trio searches, they come across the existence of the Deathly Hallows- the 3 most powerful objects in the Wizarding World.<br/><br/>I will be honest. When this first came out last year, I was expecting something big. But instead, I found myself getting bored. I found that I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought that I would. I found myself missing the fun that the previous films had. Where was the friendly banter between students? Where were the Quidditch games? In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"", there is none of that. I guess I can't blame them. It's all serious now. Voldemort's growing stronger by the minute and everyone's getting ready.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't all bad. But I found that, although it was a lengthy film, nothing ever really happened. All the good stuff took place in the first and last 10 minutes of the movie. What happened in between? I can't even remember. What a disappointment.<br/><br/>It's sad knowing that the series is coming to an end. I just hope that ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" will deliver and give the series the BANG! it deserves to go out with. This film just consisted of pure build-up. Just development, development and more development. Not that that wasn't bad, but where was the action and thrill? I hope that the last film will redeem the series.

","Absolutely Boring...<br/><br/>Why? There wasn't anything in the movie that made me excited or scared. However, Voldemort's power shown in the movie was the only highlight of the movie that I saw as a good theme. Another thing, NO HOGWARTS!??!? Where is Hogwarts? That is another thing I am unhappy about, and that is Hogwarts. The series starts with Hogwarts and ends with Hogwarts, and it isn't shown at all in the movie. If they would of shown Hogwarts, and what it currently looks like (Abandoned), it would add more suspense and make it a better movie. Also, they need to tone up the action because there was close to no action practically at all. Other than the Viper and the encounter with Draco, Bellatrix, and company, there was no action. I didn't think it was necessary to show Hermione's relationship throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give it a 4 / 10. Now you know why."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","5 April 2011"," Solidly entertaining despite feeling a bit like it's in a holding pattern but helped by the very dark tone to this penultimate film
","Voldemort's power is increasing and has taken control of Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic. Those standing against him have fled to regroup in a safer place albeit at great personal risk to themselves in their attempts to protect Harry. When Harry decides to find the rest of the Horcruxes to be able to defeat him, his friends agree to join him. However as darkness grows in the world at large, the trio find themselves facing impossible odds as they discover that Voldemort is pursuing three powerful objects of legend in the world of magic.<br/><br/>It took quite a few films but once the series moved away from the introductory stages and got darker, I have started to enjoy them a lot more. OK, I'm not into the story so much that I'm frantic for the final film to come but I am finding the dark tone and content to be much more engaging and satisfying than the more colourful opening films. So I come to the penultimate in the series ‚Äì although it is the final book split into two parts, which is the better decision since this film runs a bit too long while only covering half of it! HP7a wastes no time in getting dark as we open with several scenes of danger and it sets the tone for the rest of the film where there are many sequences and events that will challenge younger viewers. As an adult (of sorts) I enjoyed this and found that it made the danger more real within the film and thus engaged me more. It needed to do this because there are longer sections of the film where the main characters are hiding out and the drama is between them; these didn't work as well for me because I have less of myself invested in them as people, however they are well interspersed with action so that it never really feels like it is sagging too much.<br/><br/>Of course sagging (or rather, lack of conclusion) is a bit of a problem in the film because it is only half of it. The ending in particular does provide a cliff hanger but it doesn't manage to overcome the feeling that, like the lead three, we're waiting for something to happen for a lot of the film rather than actually having a lot happen. It does still work though and I mostly enjoyed it; it helps a lot that the film looks great and that the special effects work to assist the dark content. The cast are reasonably good although some of the dialogue in the character driven scenes I did find a little clunky. The lead three have grown into the parts and mostly they avoid melodrama when there is tension between them. The support cast are generally strong and made up of essentially every living British actor doing small turns to good effect.<br/><br/>Harry Potter 7a is not a brilliant film by any means and it does struggle with the fact that it is waiting for the conclusion rather than being the conclusion. However it does provide frequent dark sections and action which keep it lively but have the downside of risking frightening away younger viewers. This dark tone does really make it for me as the film engaged me by just how bleak it was in terms of content and cinematography and, while it is understandably not as good as I would have liked, I did enjoy it and I am now looking forward to a conclusion that can keep this dark, adult tone but also bring everything to a close."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","2","25 March 2011"," Thus far my favorite Harry Potter adaptation
","I haven't always been kind to the film adaptations of the Harry Potter books because they always seemed to be missing something. J.K. Rowling created a world on the page that was robust and alive, populated by dozens of interesting characters and wondrous things to behold. The movies, mainly after the second installment seemed to miss the point. They always felt like Cliff Notes summaries. That's a complaint I've had with this series for about the last four installments. Yet, here we are at the end and at last they've gotten it absolutely right. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is the beginning of the end, the top half of a two-part finale that concludes in July. This is the best installment of the series, in my opinion, and the truest to Rowling's vision. Harry's destiny has been looming all along through some admittedly tiresome fore-bearings and now those portents of doom finally come to a head.<br/><br/>This film finds Harry being hunted by the evil Voldemort and his Death Eaters who know that the moment the lad turns 18, his protection spell will be lifted and he will be fair game. Some of Harry's professor's attempt to help him escape when an ambush is sprung that sends Harry, Ron and Hermione on the lam. The trio's flight from Voldemort, and the now-corrupt Ministry of Magic, makes up the bulk of the movie as they try and obtain the horcruxes, objects that contain various pieces of the dark lord's blackened soul.<br/><br/>They set off across the English countryside never fully aware of who they can trust. The scenes outdoors (there are no scenes at Hogwarts) leave time for a surprising amount of character development especially in the now strained relationship between Harry and Ron. Outwardly, Ron is worried that Harry is endangering in his family - inside, he fears that Harry is winning Hermione's heart. What comes of that conflict is something that has been missing from his series all along: these three young actors that we've watched grow up since childhood - Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - are finally given room to act. Their performances are compelling. They are angry, frustrated, tired, hungry and scared out of their wits. They play each note just right. Grint plays Ron with an undercurrent of bitterness. Watson began her performance as a bookworm but has now become the logic center. Radcliff maintains his performance with a perfect heir of dread and melancholy.<br/><br/>Those performances are the foreground of a movie that is beautifully produced. Director David Yates and his cinematographer Eduardo Serra (who shot Blood Diamond and Unbreakable) match the story's grim tone by keeping the skies eternally overcast and the landscape fore-bidding and lonely at the same time. This film, unlike previous installments, has a heavy tone that owes more to The Lord of the Rings. This time they aren't content with just a press stamp copy of the books. They really make the story come alive especially in moments when we think the trio is safe but then the trap is sprung. There are visual tricks here that I didn't expect, most delight is a breathtaking, and oddly beautiful, animated sequence told in shadow as Hermione reads the story of The Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>There is a sense of melancholy that sets in with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I and not all of it has to do with Harry's fate. In a way, we sense the closing of an era. These are characters that we have come to love, that we've watched grow up and now they head into their final battle and their destiny. We know that Part II will focus mainly on tying up loose ends (I hope it will be more than that) but if the bottom half of this finale is as compelling as the top, we're in for a very wonderful send-off.<br/><br/>***1/2 (of four)"

If Harry can only take the apparently alternate-lifestyle Sam with him to the top of the volcanic mountain and throw in the ring, then the annoying emo chick with the pale face and the vampire fetish will die, which will bring about peace in The Middle East and erase all memories of the Telletubies.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","31 December 2010"," Maturing
","It's general consensus that the franchise has matured into a movie no longer for little kids. The Hogwarts School of Watchcraft has all but disappeared from the scene, together with it the familiar motifs such as quidditch. But this is still an adventure fantasy, for grown ups as well as young adults. Almost like in an NFL game, the line- ups are displayed up front. First, there is a meeting chaired by none other than Voldemort himself, with in attendance everybody and anybody that has earned a rightful place in the team. Bellatrix even volunteers to kill Harry but Voldemort loses no time in putting her in her place, declaring in no uncertain terms that such exquisite pleasure is reserved for himself and himself alone. The line-up of the bright side starts with the reunion of the trio in Harry's hideout, followed by worthy members of the Order of Phoenix streaming in, led by the inimitable pair of Hagrid and Alastor Mad-Eye Moody. (I haven't attached the name of the actors to the characters in the customary manner. If you don't remember who plays who, you should have. There are, however, two new comers, which I'll come to later).<br/><br/>What follows is almost like a road movie, with the trio in a continuous run from Voldemort and company, for their dear lives, while at the same time trying to find that counter-stroke to remove this ominous threat once and for all. The race is on. What they need to find is a bunch of something called Horcruxes, fragments of Voldemort's soul to be destroyed. That only one so far is found in this first part makes it quite obvious that this is only a teaser of things to come in the grand finale (i.e. after 10 years and 7 movies). In the process, the trio encounters two new comers to the franchise. Bill Nighty plays the rather officious official of the magic establishment while Rhys Ifans is Xenophilius Lovegood, a provocative journalists who reveals to the trio important legends that are crucial to their quest.<br/><br/>About the trio who whom kids in the last decade grew up, it's a pleasure to see them mature into actors with credentials. Rupert Grint brings out the so far hidden inferiority complex of Ron. Daniel Radcliff is more than ever the titular enduring hero. Emma Watson is particularly good in portraying in subtle nuances Hermione complex feelings towards these two young men with whom she grew up ‚Äì friendship and sibling-like bonding with Harry and slightly awkward but very palpable adolescence love with Ron.<br/><br/>We all look forward to THIS summer.<br/><br/>Posted on January 1, 2011"

","Note: The original text is in Portuguese. I use the Google Translator to translate. There are some passages a little bit strange. But I think you will understand what i'm saying.<br/><br/>""Part one of an epic finale"" says the poster of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Death: Part 1.<br/><br/>Yes, ""epic"" is a great setting for this first part. After almost a decade, Harry Potter is one step closer to its climax final. And the brightly Part 1 prepares the ground for the anticipated conclusion. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the best film in the series. And it is simple to understand why. The screenplay by Steve Kloves, adapted from the book by J. K. Rowling, at no time is gone - Feature that I always felt the show - everything is fine exploited in an unconventional rhythm in blockbusters. Each sequence lasts for several minutes, and no action. But they are sequences very important to explore more deeply the relationship the main trio, Harry, Hermione and Ron, and bring the viewer more still the same and the voltage from which they are. But of course, That history has been divided into two parts contributed much Kloves to develop your best adaptation so far.<br/><br/>The performance of the leading trio for the first time convinced me, and also moved. Daniel Radcliffe, who began to show an evolution of interpretation in recent Bond movies, finally gets here better demonstrate the feelings and also increase their expression. Just as Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who seem more comfortable than ever in their roles. But the highlight is Grint, who despite continue to be the comic relief, does very well when you have to create a more serious and emotional. As for the supporting cast, the names speak for themselves: Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Brendan Glesson (Alastor Moody), Peter Mullan (Yaxley), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange), Timothy Spall (Wormtail). And yet this is Part 1 participation of the excellent Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour) and around also great John Hurt (Ollivander).<br/><br/>Eduardo Serra's photography from the production design by Stuart Craig creates the darker look for the series so far. And even when there is color, the tone is melancholy. But it could not be otherwise. After all, evil is now dominant. And for that reason, the film is more Heavy saga. In the opening scenes already spoken of ""Muggles"" murdered. At one point, and full of open wounds blood are shown without censorship. The director David Yates saves the public and makes sure to show the blood, deaths, and all horror that is reigning in that universe. There are no cuts to minimize situations. But there are also moments where the characters seek a little joy in the situation of terror, and this is a consequence search that is one of the most touching scenes in the movie where Harry and Hermione dancing in an attempt to forget for a moment the horrible reality in which they find themselves.<br/><br/>Despite being a film full of tension and suspense, David Yates, a flawless direction, chooses to use more open plans and plans average, making the film not stifling, so even in the midst of all that tension, the projection does not cause ill feeling in the viewer.<br/><br/>The action scenes, which are few, they are still exciting, which mainly occurs at the beginning of the film. The effect of the visual Deathly Hallows: Part 1 are the most developed of the entire series. But what stands out is the elf Dobby, who is back in this first part and this time very convincing, which contributes to the scenes sadder than long. And yet in the visual aspects, the film surprises to change its visual language to a fully digital animation stylized, it serves to show the viewer a story read by Hermione, which is full of significance to the plot.<br/><br/>I stress once again, Harry Potter does not look anything like a blockbuster. It's a slow film - which does not mean it is ""stopped"" or boring - with a few action scenes and focused on feeling. And this demonstrates the courage of their directors - and also respect and trust the fans - to split the order into two parts, just to create a movie very deep and dense, being as faithful as possible to work J. K. Rowling."
"ackstasis","7","1","2","10 December 2010"," ""These are dark times, there is no denying""
","I've always had a bit of a beef with ""Deathly Hallows,"" the final novel in J.K. Rowling's lucrative franchise. My main issue is that nothing much happened (or, perhaps more accurately, nothing happened that the discerning reader couldn't spot from 100 pages away). Kill off a marginal character here, throw in a Christ allegory there. And don't get me started on that epilogue! Even so, I approached Part 1 of the final cinematic chapter with a mind uncluttered by prejudice or preconception. I've always thought the reins should have been passed onto a new director for each film, but David Yates at least redeemed himself for the rushed 'Order of the Phoenix (2007)' with 'Half Blood Prince (2009),' which chose its tone and then stuck to it.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)' predictably suffers the pitfalls of its source material: namely, that nothing much happened in the first 400 pages of the novel. Because of this, the film feels more like a prologue than a chapter. Yates does an excellent job at establishing the mood, but then fails to do anything with it. Harry broods for a while, Ron gets angry for no apparent reason, Harry briefly dances to a dubiously out-of-place Nick Cave song, and then returns to his brooding. There's an episodic structure to the narrative, but each episode fails to give any overriding sense of achievement (invariably ending with Death Eaters suddenly bursting onto the scene). And why, for that matter, does Yates insist on constantly trying to surprise us? We know the bloody snake is coming back one more time. I don't like waiting around for obvious shock tactics!<br/><br/>But good news there is: the actors are all terrific. The three leads can now carry a movie pretty much by themselves, the services of such veterans as Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, and David Thewlis reduced to a mere sidebar. In the absence of Hogwarts, the locations are beautifully chosen, so secluded and serene that it's difficult to believe that the Fourth Reich is breaking out in the wizarding world. So I've been complaining a lot, but overall I enjoyed the film. Aside from a few amateurish flourishes that got my goat, 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is an enjoyable viewing experience, and I await the final installment - without bated breath, but I await it nevertheless."
"MaeAbdulbaki","9","1","2","8 December 2010"," One of the Best Harry Potter Films
","**This review contains spoilers**<br/><br/>I have to admit, I had my doubts when I heard David Yates was again directing the last two Harry Potter films--the two most important ones in the epic finale of J.K. Rowling's masterpiece. He did a mediocre job at best directing the fifth and sixth installments, focusing too much of his attention on the action and not enough on character interactions or story.<br/><br/>However, after seeing part one of ""Deathly Hallows"", I am happy to have been proved wrong.<br/><br/>The movie held much of the magic, sadness and hopelessness that the book embodied in the first half. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson held their own and went above and beyond expectations. They truly embodied their characters here more than ever.<br/><br/>This movie had everything from humor to action. It wasn't prolonged or drawn out and the lack of music in some places gives it the right mood of foreboding, melancholy, or sadness. Also, during the chase scene in the forest the music would have only downplayed what was going on.<br/><br/>The characters have really grown up and the journey they take is not only in search of Horcruxes, but is also a road to maturity.<br/><br/>Things that were done exceptionally well: The fight between Harry and Ron was just so terrific. I could really feel the anger Ron was spewing at Harry due to the Horcrux around his neck, which makes everything you're feeling very much worse. His insecurities about Hermione's affection toward him were also brought out because of this and Rupert Grint did an amazing job here as well as the scene where he destroys the locket and when he tells his friends how he found them. That monologue could have turned out disastrously cheesy and over done, but it wasn't. It was very sweet and you could tell that in that very moment how much Ron loved Hermione. The comedic timing is done well also.<br/><br/>The dance between Harry and Hermione was very sweet and really adds a feeling of loss as Harry tries to cheer up his friend after Ron leaves. The Seven Potters scene was very well done also. You're really convinced that there are seven different people parading around as Harry. Very funny.<br/><br/>The infiltration of the ministry was very good. Lots of suspense. Hermione leaving her parents and erasing herself from their memories was very sad. Also, Dobby's death was one of the most depressing things you'll see in any of the Potter movies.<br/><br/>I could go through a whole list, but really it was all the little moments that made the movie special. Looks, gestures and whatnot really cemented this movie.<br/><br/>What could have been done better: I wish Harry had told Ron that he thought of Hermione as a sister and how depressed she was during his absence after Ron destroys the locket that held evil versions of Harry and Hermione berating Ron and feeding off his fears. I'm being nit picky, but the movies seem to feed off of a fantasy Harry/Hermione relationship sometimes and don't give enough justice to Ron. So, I thought it needed to be said.<br/><br/>I had also hoped that Ron would scream Hermione's name when she was being tortured, but that can be forgiven as his facial expressions and Emma Watson's very real screams did it justice enough.<br/><br/>These are overall little things that, looking at the movie as a whole, can be overlooked.<br/><br/>Having written all this, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is not a movie to be missed for Potter watchers, movie and book fans alike. It ranks right up there with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". I have hope that the second part will be just as satisfying."

","I wont go into too much detail as to why I'm disappointed with this movie. That being said, I still remain disappointed. There were some points in the movie I did enjoy but the pacing, in whole, was dreadful. Much like the last Harry Potter film. I don't know why we needed to see HP and HG dance in a tent. Was that really relevant? The flow was so slow, when something finally did happen, I forgot to care about the most important aspect of the film, imo, the characters.I'm not sure exactly what went wrong with this franchise. David Yates Maybe??? I am sure, however, that I would not advise my friends to spend $25.00, per couple, to see this in the theater. Definitely a ""renter""."
"webspinner128","9","1","2","4 December 2010"," Like a Good Wine, Harry Potter Gets Better with Age
","The unique thing about the Harry Potter is that unlike most movies things it has had a chance to evolve. Very rarely will you see Hollywood take such great pains to maintain such a momentum as it has with this series. Perhaps because HP is just so huge, and the novels just so perfect, that to get it wrong would be crime against nature. Because of this we get characters and a story that grows up with us, from the awkward but pleasant freshman years, through Cuaron's dark, coming-of-age masterpiece, and on to this solid penultimate chapter<br/><br/>Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is not perfect. It has the same flaws any other movie adapted from a book does--too much material and two little time to include it all. Thankfully the decision to split the last book in half paid off because the pacing doesn't seem nearly as rushed as the others. David Yates, who has had time to hone his Potter craftsmanship, has taken the best of the series' drama, fear, suspense, and humor and fashioned it into something very enjoyable. But with this one the stakes are so high and impending doom so pervasive, that it becomes obvious that you aren't watching a children's fantasy anymore. The kids have to safe, whimsical Hogwarts to return to. Instead they are lost out in the open world amongst unsympathetic Muggles and a wizarding world that has become completely treacherous.<br/><br/>Aiding this gritty realism is the closer attention paid to the psyche of Potter trinity (Harry, Ron, and Hermione). After a chaotic, violent first half-hour Harry, Ron, and Hermione go into lonely exile where they are confronted with possibly the scariest monster we've seen in HP thus far: powerlessness and hopelessness. Frustrated and powerless, the trio spends weeks walking in the English wilderness, listening for their loved ones' names as the radio reports the newly-murdered. At the same time the heroes are forced to confront the weaknesses of their very friendship, so much more poignantly laid bare in wasteland than it was amongst the hormonal chatter of the teens back at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the other characters do not shine with nuance and charisma in the limited screen time they are given. Newbies Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour and Peter Mullen as the Death Eater Yaxley are particularly efficient with their few minutes, not to mention Potter alum Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge.<br/><br/>But despite having the same magic of the other films, Deathly Hallows Part I is where the series finally matures."
"Reel_starz","8","1","2","1 December 2010"," The darkest and best chapter (so far) of a beloved saga
","When people ask whether I like Harry Potter, I find myself in an awkward position. On one hand, ever since my mom first read me The Sorcerer's Stone when I was eight, I have been enchanted by the world J.K. Rowling brought to life, and for a time, I read the books voraciously, tearing through each one multiple times in a row. On the other hand, I found the final two books a severe letdown after hundreds of pages of rising anticipation, and the movies, while satisfactory, always seemed to be missing something. With the possible exception of the first film, they lacked that magical spark, that sense of wonder and mystery, that made the books so special.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, after seeing David Yates's adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 1), I was reminded of why I'd loved Harry Potter so much as a kid. Perhaps it was the knowledge that the end of the franchise is imminent, but for the first time in my history of watching Harry Potter movies, I was genuinely captivated. This entry had a vivacity and spirit that was absent from its predecessors, which were decent revisions of Rowling's books but not particularly great movies. Energetic and poignant, Deathly Hallows finally managed to surmount that trend.<br/><br/>From the very first scene, depicting a conference of sorts between the Death Eaters and Voldemort, it is obvious that this is not going to be a cheerful movie. While the previous few installments, beginning with the Goblet of Fire, have gradually grown darker and more serious, none of those can compare to the bleakness that pervades Deathly Hallows, both thematically and visually. Even during the day-time scenes, shades of black, gray and blue suffuse the screen, a world away from the radiant Diagon Alley and flamboyant Hogwarts uniforms in the first film, helping to accentuate the perpetually melancholy atmosphere. In fact, some parts of the film, especially one sequence involving a snake and flies, are downright creepy; during my screening, several of the younger audience members noticeably cringed with fright at some of the more spine-chilling moments. All this darkness is not superfluous. If it hadn't been before, it is now clear how much is at stake, and the shift of action away from Hogwarts provides not only a breath of fresh air, a welcome escape from the confines of the school, but it also compels audiences to fully realize the danger Voldemort poses to both the magical and Muggle worlds. The Death Eaters's regime as they take over the Ministry of Magic is startlingly reminiscent of Nazi Germany, evoking serious issues such as prejudice and genocide.<br/><br/>Even more than the visuals, though, the film's intense emotion is conveyed by its terrific, well-rounded cast. In the fashion of many epics, Harry Potter is truly an ensemble movie, perhaps confirmed by the fact that despite critical acclaim, the Academy has yet to give a single actor in the franchise a nomination, and the veteran performers, many of whom are celebrated British actors, fit in flawlessly, showing off their collective talent yet never upstaging their younger costars. It is a simultaneously fascinating and moving experience to watch Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson on screen, as you both marvel at how well they have matured and fondly recall the three youths we were first introduced to almost ten years ago. Because of their rich, unaffected performances, Harry, Hermione and Ron feel real and multidimensional, not much different from any teenager you'd see on the street, and their effortless chemistry strengthens the sense of camaraderie shared by the three adolescents, which in turn helps form a deep emotional connection with the audience. In part because of the stars' apparent lack of glamour or vanity, we care about the characters they portray.<br/><br/>Besides the cast, the most surprising element of this newest Harry Potter movie is David Yates's direction. Although he helmed the two previous installments, Yates never proved himself more competent and delightful than he does in the Deathly Hallows, handling the somber atmosphere and subject matter with finesse and managing to imbue the film with energy in even the darkest moments. Using the much-maligned yet undeniably effective ""shaky-cam"", a technique I don't remember being employed in any of the previous films, he keeps the many action sequences lively, if a tad chaotic; it is not difficult to imagine the movie working well in 3D, as the film-makers originally planned. Equally impressive is Yates's ability to intersperse moments of humor and joy throughout the movie without detracting from its serious themes. In fact, one of the most memorable scenes, at least for me, was one in which Harry attempts to console a despondent Hermione by dancing with her; devoid of any romantic tension, this bittersweet scene simmers with youthful innocence, a casual reminder to the audience that even though the fate of the world hangs on their shoulders, these people are still kids who yearn for ordinary lives. It is ultimately moments like that, little flashes of life and humanity, that make this a truly memorable journey."

I think Hermoine is the best person for the characters because she has a good sense of humor.. I loved Ron and his brothers and how they grew up a lot from the other harry potters.. i like Rons parents a lot and how they are smart and nice to their children.. Dobby is one of the best and awesome elf. I like helen Carter and the person she played she played a good part. Daniel Ratcliff is always the best at harry potter and the way he plays harry potter is always good. I want to see it on DVD to see the special effects to see how they made Voldermort..

","Although not my favourite book of the series, I do think that this is the best film yet. I did however find it surprising it was only rated a 12A especially following the first scene in the Malfoy's mansion depicting a near lifeless character floating painfully above the table- not something I would want to take a 12 year old to see.<br/><br/>As an avid Potter fan I was, i think most impressed with the improvement of Daniel Radcliffe's emotional capabilities as an actor, something which, personally I have always found lacking.<br/><br/>I also found this film the most true to the books, something which pleased my friends in the cinema as I wasn't huffing every other scene at something that was portrayed ""Wrong"".<br/><br/>The plot was action packed and they haven't missed out some important details like they have, so many other times in the other films- again something I found most annoying in ""The Half Blood Prince"".<br/><br/>The penultimate scene definitely brought a tear to my eye as, as i think it did so many of the other cinema goers.<br/><br/>The effects were stunning through out.<br/><br/>This film is definitely going to see, even if you are not in to the Potter scene, it is full of fight scene's, good one liners, top notch acting and fantastic production, I very much look forward too next summer and the final episode!"

I loved the slow-paced mystery/adventure road movie style and it's great character development. Finally the acting was properly believable, not that they weren't good before. All of them, Daniel, Rupert and Emma are the best actors for the roles but in this one they finally shined.<br/><br/>Most people will say this is their favourite because of it being the latest one, but this is my favourite because I actually cared for the characters.<br/><br/>I loved the directing in this film, sound effects and editing. If I was part of the BAFTAs or Academy Awards or Golden Globes then I would nominated this for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Like it says on here the film is ""emotionally satisfying"". And it is.

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's very enjoyable as it builds up our anticipation and excitement for the final film, as we follow Harry, Ron and Hermione journey to destroy the Horcruxes, with many great twists throughout. I did have a problem with the slow moving plot, it lingers on certain points for far too long, we watch a lot of camping and scenes that are basically only people talking, it was good for character development but there does come a time when we start to crave adventure. The cast is fantastic as usual, with everyone seeming to mature and grow just as much as their characters have, Radcliffe, Watson and Grint are given a lot more here in regards to acting that they ever have previously, delivering emotional performances that are at times heart breaking, they have been through a lot together, but we can feel that this the toughest moment in their friendship. Though it may be slow, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is still an exciting movie that will have fans anticipating part 2, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure of fantasy film. <br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione begin their journey to destroy the Horcruxes, thus destroying Voldemort's immortality, but many unexpected events disturb their quest. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe"

","Another plus in the series of the Harry Potter genre. Now Harry and his team must find three of the most powerful items that had created the Deathly Hallows.

Not to mention losing a very old friend in the process. Ronald also nearly loses his mind which has him abandon the group only to reunite soon after. This movie holds a drastic amount of emotions which all can relate to. This shows what the wizards themselves are becoming, and some do not find the change all that appealing. Especially the Malfoy Family. Though encouraging and tempting the fates of Voldemort may be, there is a fine line between true evil, and those who are just bystanders. With Voldemort, his vision is to become the most powerful of all wizards, and Harry is nearly at his ropes end and losing hope. What a great addition to the most successful movies in history. A must watch."
"jaz16","10","1","2","28 November 2010"," Just Brilliant and Very Moving!
","I loved it! It was spectacularly well directed. I haven't read the book yet(so I can't find anything wrong with the movie)but this story is very powerfully told from the movie. This movie will make you cry at some parts in the movie and make you laugh and smile. You may not ever forget this movie. From the beginning to the end the movie gets you hooked. It takes it's sweetly time in the beginning at first but the movie is worth watching. The Deathly Hallows (Part 1) is probably the best thrilling and moving film so far out of the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>I have to say I felt every emotion Hermione felt in the movie by Emma Watson's performance. She has really grown as a actress. Emma has really shown that she's got some amazing acting chops.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I felt really sorry for Harry. He's been through a lot. Daniel Radcliffe does amazingly good at playing Harry.<br/><br/>I loved Rupert Grint's performance in this movie. He shines bright and you never forget the scenes he's in. <br/><br/>Again I loved it. It's epic. All the actors were just brilliant in this movie, very convincing. Praises to all the people who worked on this film and of course to J.K.

"moviewizguy","9","1","2","28 November 2010"," It All Ends Here
","Part 1 begins as Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction--the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. (Warner Bros. Pictures)<br/><br/>As the WB logo appeared deteriorating before my very eyes, I knew things have changed since the first HP film. Each succeeding HP film has gotten progressively darker as the series is coming to its end. HP7, the first part of the last film, doesn't change the pattern. It's a dark film, literally and figuratively. The film shows blood as if it were nothing and even the cinematography has gone shaky-cam style in some action scenes. However, being part of the last film and all, HP7 doesn't have a lot of action as one might have thought. It's arguably the slowest moving HP film to date and that's equally its main strength and downfall.<br/><br/>Having the pace slow down quite a bit hurts the film for the most obvious reason: It meanders, especially in the second act. I actually felt like looking at my watch, which never happened to me before in the previous films. However, the film is still filled with a lot of information. Non-readers will find themselves overwhelmed by the information hurdled at them and even I, who have read the books, felt confused in parts of the film. Ironically, most of the series' best moments are in this film. That's because the slow pace allows for a lot of intimate scenes between the three young actors, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint.<br/><br/>These three actors have grown with each passing film and it shows here. I think Watson and Grint were really at the top of their games in this film. Radcliffe, while the weakest, is good too but not as good as the other two. While I'll take intimate scenes between them over action any day, there were just some scenes that were really tedious. Still, that didn't ruin the film for me. It just bothered me. The other cast members don't appear in the film as much, but it's appropriate considering the three main actors are isolated from society. Like the previous HP films, the cinematography and production are gorgeous and the score by newcomer Alexandre Desplat brings in a fresh voice to the franchise.<br/><br/>As a fan, I would say this is the most disappointing HP film to date, although that's no way to say the film is bad. It's a good film, but a very flawed one at that mainly due to it's slow pacing. The three actors are as great as ever and the film ends at the perfect point for part two. If you're a HP fan, there's no doubt you'll enjoy this."
"mysteryfan04","7","1","2","27 November 2010"," Darker With Less Action
","It's the beginning of the end. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a major departure from the previous films. This movie is a lot darker, more violent, and thankfully, scarier than most horror films out nowadays. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are finally seventeen. They are now ready to take Dumbledore's mission to destroy all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, which hold his soul. As the trio tries to hunt down all of the Horcruxes, they mature and discover just how much they've grown emotionally and romantically. The numerous scares work thanks to the wonderful visuals, musical score, and cinematography. Like the other Harry Potter films, there are few action scenes, but when present, they are well-choreographed and completely engaging. The characters are further developed, revealing new relationships as well as some intriguing secrets. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson deliver their best performances yet. Each one of them gets their moment to shine and prove why they deserve to have great careers after this franchise ends. The director and screenwriter were terrific in making this film more mature then its predecessors, but several flaws place it below the best of the films (the 3rd, 5th, and 6th in my opinion). Too many awkward scenes are present, and the usual touches of humor are placed in the most inappropriate moments of the film. The plot as a whole will feel tricky and confusing at various points throughout the film because far too much is happening at once. Additionally, the pacing feels a little off. Harry Potter 7: Part 1 is a solid but uneven penultimate entry to the deservedly popular franchise."
"imajestr","8","1","2","26 November 2010"," Both a Triumph and a Failure in Some Ways...
","This is not a film propelled by its plot. Plot, specifically, is its central weakness.<br/><br/>Probably its greatest strength is the cinematography. Its a visually gorgeous film in every way possible. The house elves look better than they ever have, the weird inky trails the Death Eaters leave as they fly is even better looking than in any previous film.<br/><br/>And, of course, the characters, as should be, are the focus. It is hard to write an entirely fair critique having read the books, but the characters continue to reveal their complexities and their weaknesses. All around, they continue to gain depth.<br/><br/>But, to delve into this film's weaker point, one must look at it as a standalone film, which is what it tries to be, and succeeds on some levels, but fails on others.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it very much feels like the first half of a story. There is no resolution, which is not problematic in itself, except for the fact that a good deal of the film feels stalled in the woods. This is by far the slowest of the films, and the least spectacular in the literal sense of the word. The magic is not gone, nor is the humor, which, honestly, is handled very well considering the dark overtones. However, we spend a good deal of the film hanging out, aimlessly, in the woods.<br/><br/>Aimlessness is exactly the problem, and its a frustration that is supposed to be shared between the characters and the audience, but it wavers quite dangerously over a line called ""tedium."" And some of the film does begin to feel tedious, as if we're only stuck in certain scenes because that's what has to happen on screen in order to get to the next thing. I noticed a certain relief in my theater when something funny happened, as if everyone was thinking, ""Alright, something finally happened."" Like they were a little too eager to laugh, and needed something, anything, to keep their attention on the screen.<br/><br/>Of course, this seems nitpicky, but considering that the story here is meant to garner interest, and to increase the tension, and that it gets a little tiresome before the end credits roll, something is clearly not working as it should.<br/><br/>Yet, considering that this is practically spot-on with the first half of the book, it's hard not to have sympathy for the production team. Whatever problems the book had, so too does the movie have, and for fans that is going to seem great, but the movie still does not move in an entirely satisfactory way.<br/><br/>This is to be fairly expected, and for someone unfamiliar with the story, I imagine it must leave one waiting tensely for the next installment."
"johntheholder","7","1","2","25 November 2010"," scriptwriting vs direction
","A good film basically is composed of certain variables. The main ones , arguably are : Script , Direction and Acting .<br/><br/>I haven't read Harry Potter books ( maybe the two first ones a few years back) , but as a human being , my instincts suggest that all the books are fairly of equal good writing and storytelling.<br/><br/>Story = Script : All Harry Potter films have more or less equally good script. ( the screenplay writer's work merely affects the actual story-script , written by J.K Rowling) Plus based on the fact that the main cast is the same , and the supporting cast of all films , although a bit different , clearly wasn't the attribute that resulted in the film's quality.<br/><br/>The attribute, that in the Harry Potter film franchise mostly affected the film's result is ( and cant be no other ) the direction.<br/><br/>The casted directors in all harry potter films are : Chris Columbus , Alfonso Cuaron , Mike Newell, and David Yates.<br/><br/>Out of those four directors , the best ones are : Alfonso Cuaron , Mike Newell ( check their filmography for proof).<br/><br/>The best Harry Potter films are the films directed by those two directors. The Prisoner of Azkaban and The goblet of fire.<br/><br/>Chris Columbus comes third best , and least skilled comes David Yates.<br/><br/>Ironically he is the one that was assigned to direct more Harry Potter films than all of the other directors . He directed the 5th , 6th , 7th part one , 7th part two ( coming).<br/><br/>The worst director the franchise ever hired , directs 4/8 of harry potter films. (The 6th one was the worst , totally neutral film , no impressions at all ) Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows is not a bad film . i give it a 7/10. What i am trying to state, is that if Alfonso Cuaron ( the best out of the four ) or Mike Newells had directed it, the result would have been much better ; it would have been a solid 8/10 ( i bet it would).<br/><br/>An example of David Yates mediocre direction is that in this 7th film , it was as if he didn't want to face "" a hard to shoot- scene"" .<br/><br/>The moving building , that appears first in the prisoner of Azkaban ( where a building appears in the middle of two other ones) , the part where the building slowly appears isn't shown on screen. we see two buildings , then the scene is cut , and then we jump the the scene where the third building is already there.

","The biggest problem with dividing the movie version of HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS into two parts was always going to be that the middle third of that book isn't exactly brimming over with triumphant and joyful rainbows and lollipops. Ordinarily in an episodic serial the like of this one, we tend to get small payoffs along the way to the more climactic victory, each installment coming to a satisfying conclusion even if an over-arching and meta-style cliffhanger still looms. So how, I had long wondered, would the folks at Potter Central deal with that issue? At what point in the all-pervasive bleakness of¬Ö well, the majority of THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, would they find us our moment of the happy on which to bring down the curtain, and usher in Part 2? As it turns out, they just¬Ö don't.

Well written, beautifully executed with superlative performances and a pitch-perfect score, this is a movie full of tension and humor and romance and drama and action and suspense and oh, so much more.<br/><br/>Ah, y'know what? Forget about that bad taste. 'Cause thinking back now to all the deliciousness that preceded it, all is forgiven.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, this movie took hold of my central nervous system and bent it to its will like a kid kneading Play-Doh. Where I was supposed to laugh, I laughed. Where I was supposed to cry, I cried. Where I was supposed to be shocked, or scared, or concerned, or outraged, I was all of those things, and more besides. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS takes you on a tumultuous emotional journey, from beginning to lamentable end, as though your heart were lodged inside that runaway flying car in which Harry and Ron arrived at Hogwarts in THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS -‚Äì after which it then gets thoroughly beaten up by the Whumping Willow.<br/><br/>The two hours and change of this movie fly by, and yet so much happens that, in retrospect, it seems like it must have been a longer film. And yet nothing feels omitted or rushed or glossed over¬Ö although the final deus ex Dobby was, perhaps, a little too heavily signposted.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, there is a lot of death in the movie, both seen and merely referenced. If you're planning to take the kids to see this one, and you have kids who frighten easily, then take my advice and don't. The later HARRY POTTER books are questionable children's fare; this movie is emphatically anything but a kid flick.<br/><br/>It is also, without a doubt, the best HARRY POTTER movie yet -- which is pretty impressive, considering I wouldn't have accounted the book upon which it's based even in the series' Top 5. I'll go even further and say that this may be the best movie adaptation of a book in recent memory.<br/><br/>Okay, so I wasn't thrilled with the ending. But upon reflection, it may just be that I wasn't thrilled that it ended it all; certainly, July 2011 cannot get here soon enough. And in the meantime, at least we have the book... and considering they were able to produce THIS great of a movie out of only the first half of it, then perhaps it's time I gave it another go.<br/><br/>This review is an excerpt.

One thing I love about this was that it didn't sit you down for 5 minutes and say ""previously on Harry Potter"" the film says ""No!"" If you don't know what's been happening in at least the previous 2 or 3 films your lost chemosobe. I fear you would be so lost in this dark adaptation of one of the most read books of the past decade. I loved the end where Voldamort takes Dumbledoor's wand... Epic scene. I'm very happy with this movie, and will probably watch it several times before it leaves IMAX. Don't let anyone tell you you should wait for the blu ray. This is the best movie I've seen in the franchise yet and My pick for the best picture of the year. It has best actor written all over it. Daniel and Emma have really evolved into great actors over the years and there performances had better not be overlooked award season."
"Pumpkin_Man","6","1","2","23 November 2010"," The 1st Part to the Epic Conclusion!!!
","Over the past few years, I've lost a little interest in the Harry Potter series, but I have to see it through 'til the end. This first part was fast-paced and decent, but kinda dragged a little bit toward the end, like it was hurrying to get to the second part. After the death of Dumbledore, Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of Hogwarts in order to find and destroy the last Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort. In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey. Harry also must find the sword of Godric Gryffindor so they can destroy each Horcrux. I would definitely recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1!!!"
"fabps","9","1","2","22 November 2010"," The most faithful Potter film
","This is, without a doubt, the best adapted Harry Potter film to date.<br/><br/>I know that many people think that the decision to split the ""Deathly Hallows"" adaptation in two parts is all about making more profit out of the last installment. Well, certainly they had that on account but, and I hope, they had also wanted to deliver the HP fans all over the world the epic finale that this series deserves. And ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" raises even more the expectations for next July. And why? Simply, Part 1 is one of the best Potter films ever made! After reading all the seven books and watching all the six films, the first film of the ""Deathly Hallows"" adaptation is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>David Yates, after ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" (which, by the way, I quite enjoyed and yes, I'm a HP fan), had the privilege of directing the two-part film and Part 1 is almost by-the-book. Yes, they added scenes that it weren't on the novel and cut some parts that are in the book. However, unlike some in HBP, they help to install the dark mood of the movie and to fresh things up (like the Harry/Hermione dance scene). Talking more about the book parts adapted. Well, as I already said, it's the most faithful Potter movie of all six. While watching I remembered the majority of the scenes I read a few year's ago.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, especially Emma Watson (in my opinion, Hermione surpassed Harry and Ron in a few scenes; is great to see a actor/actress evolve so much over the years). Rupert Grint/ Ron has finally(!) had some intense emotional scenes. Radcliffe was better either. Aside from the trio, we have, as always, Helen Boham Carter as the crazy Bellatrix and, believe me, when I saw her torturing Hermione, biting her arm, I became dazzled by such extraordinary acting skills.<br/><br/>Finally, let me get more technical. The cinematography is beautiful. Eduardo Serra made a wonderful job with the footage. The soundtrack is great; I see that Desplat as worked hard on the picture and I'm anxious for what he is going to do for Part 2.<br/><br/>For me it's 9/10. It's well directed, good acting, great casting, gorgeous cinematography. The adaptation is (at least most of it) like the book, but I think they should stretched the first battle a little bit longer, it seemed a bit rushed (hey don't get me wrong, it was great and smartly filmed, no matter what) and I felt some lack of emotion after the news of Mad-Eye's death. But does not the great quality of this movie. Fellow fans and non-fans, please enjoy it."

","Watched the movie and i must say it is indeed a very good movie.Boring sometimes in scenes but they catch up.Although i must say that i expected more from this movie and it was not that good.If this part 1 is good with all that road trips and limited action what we expect from part 2 [ to those who read the book may understand my point battle of hogwarts,theft from gringotts so many deaths and action and interesting facts revealed like snape was double agent and more]<br/><br/>Loved that animation scene of the deathly hallows and scenes of death eaters although they must give dark and evil characters more time in my opinion <br/><br/>at last wanna say ITS MUST WATCH FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HARRY POTTER <br/><br/>and those who think its a movie of kids who do magic and go school and blah blah <br/><br/>see this MOVIE"
"krzysiektom","9","1","2","22 November 2010"," the best film of the series
","For me it is by far the best film of all HP films so far. Yates did a splendid job. So far I have only enjoyed ""The prisoner of Azkhaban"" and bits a pieces of others, but this one is the first I like a lot from start to finish. It is much more mature than previous ones, just like the trio of heroes is getting more mature. There is no cheesy dialog or childish jokes or sub-plots, the violent bits are done well and the use of music is excellent - sparse, economic but very efficient. Yates is not afraid to have several slow moments without any music, and I liked it. The short story about 3 brothers is a surprising gem of animation in itself. And despite being grim and sad, the film contains quite a lot of delicate humor. The acting is good, especially from Helena Bonham-Carter, the girl playing Hermione and that old silent lady historian, who has a short, mute but very effective appearance."
"MimiXDawn","9","1","2","22 November 2010"," Epic but lacking something
","The latest installment in the epic Harry Potter series is utterly amazing. Sitting in the movie theater, you do not realize that you have been watching this amazing movie for well over two hours until it cuts to black and the credits begin to roll. Harry Potter fans, such as myself, know that this is only the beginning of the battle and all the crazy confusing battles are not until the latter half. Where the split the film is a good decision, but it leaves the viewer dying for the second part; probably great planning on WB's behalf. Well done. It is lacking something though, but as someone who read the books I'm going to believe that something is missing, but overall it is an amazing adaptation."
"iwantorlando05","10","1","2","21 November 2010"," An almost perfect adaptation
","This movie was AMAZING!!! I've got to see it again immediately!! Off the top of my head, my favorite scenes were: Anything with Emma Watson in it. She was amazing in this movie. I was blown away by her performance. I loved the part when she obliviates her parents memories, and when she's face to face with Scabior on the other side of the protective charm, her performance when she's being tortured by Bellatrix is so real that I was genuinely worried about her. It hurt my heart to hear her crying and screaming like that. Poor Hermione.<br/><br/>The locket scene. What a steamy kiss. I also loved the part when Harry is following the Silver Doe...it was exactly like the book! The H/Hr dance was so sweet! Dan looked really sexy in that scene! The opening Malfoy Manor scene and the Godric's Hollow sequence scared the CRAP out of me. I wasn't expecting them to really faithfully adapt those sequences. When Hermione goes into the room with all of those flies and there's blood all over the walls...OMG! :shock: I also loved all the R/Hr moments. This film really took their relationship to a deeper, more adult level. It was so great to see it take that step from the teenage love relationship they had before.<br/><br/>Another scene that I loved was the ministry of magic scene. It was perfectly adapted from the book. Just how I pictured it. I love how it was suspenseful yet funny at the same time.<br/><br/>And last, but not least..the Three Brothers scene was amazing!! I wasn't expecting to see that beautiful piece of animation in the film. I was completely sucked in and Hermione told the story beautifully. I thought it was really smart of the filmmakers to tell the story that way instead of using real actors or just showing Hermione reading it. Great job! So, yeah...I loved the whole movie. There were a couple of things I wish had been included like Luna's room and Krum at the wedding and more of Dumbledore's backstory, but it's hard to judge since we still have a whole other half of movie to look forward to."
"mountaindewrocks","6","1","2","21 November 2010"," An improvement since six, but still not great
","Harry Potter 7 depicts the first half of the final book in the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was definitely an improvement from its predecessor. Unfortunately, this is more of a testament to the badness of six than one to the goodness of seven.<br/><br/>I suppose I shall list out the good and the bad.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>Acting The acting on the part of the young wizarding trio was in this film was definitely dramatically better than in previous films. The acting experience that Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have accrued over their careers shows in this film, and I thoroughly enjoyed their portrayals of their respective characters. Not only did they give more realistic performances in the dramatic and intense scenes, they also balanced their characters by giving very real, down-to-earth performances in the more chill scenes. The integration of humor in this film contributed largely to this balance.<br/><br/>Wit One of the few good aspects of the sixth film was the wit that was put into the script. In this film, the humor makes itself increasingly present and integrates better into the script. The entire audience got a lot of laughs out of the one-liners in this film. In addition, the humor added a more personable, identifiable nature to each of the main characters, especially Ron Weasley.<br/><br/>Story This film stayed far more loyal to its corresponding book than did the sixth. It skipped ahead in the beginning a bit, but overall it included most of the important events of the book.<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>Story Unfortunately, the story also has a negative side to it. Although it was an improvement to the sixth, it was still very rushed. Many of the big events of the story were not fully developed, and thus they seemed out of place. For instance, Ron's departure from the trio comes very suddenly, and lacks the pretext that it had in the books. Many events, including the battle with the seven Potters, and the kidnapping of Harry, Ron, and Hermione by the Snatchers, also seemed very random, since they were not built up to. And finally, many plot details were left out that make the movie confusing to those who haven't read the book. Those who have not read the book will not understand what the mirror shard Harry is always looking into is, nor will they be able to decipher who Grindelwald really is, nor will they understand how the Elder Wand really works, nor will they understand how Harry repelled Voldemort during the seven Potters scene.<br/><br/>Directing Okay, I had a big problem with the way many of the scenes were filmed. A lot of intense scenes disappointed me, as they did not nearly match up with what I imagined they'd be. The seven Potters scene, for instance, was a major flop. The very essence of the ambush was compromised, and to me, it almost seemed as if the Order was attacking the Death Eaters. The chase through the forest (when the trio gets snatched) was also not a welcome change to the plot for me. Harry's accidental breaking of the Taboo was much better than the trio randomly apparating in front of a team of Snatchers, in my opinion. Overall, the directing was one of my biggest problems with this movie. I should note, however, that there was one particular scene I really enjoyed, and that was the reading of the tale of the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>Musical Score The musical score of this film was composed in a very safe manner. In other words, it was nothing really new or exciting. Instead, the score was very plain and simple. It's my belief that as a film series progresses, the musical score should get bolder and bolder. With Harry Potter, however, it stays stagnant throughout the series.<br/><br/>Overall, it's one of the better films of the series, but still not what I would hope for a Harry Potter story. If you have read the book, this film will make much more sense."
"MovieDude1893","10","1","2","21 November 2010"," Half of a masterpiece
","There is a pervading sense of doom in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I. A dark pall is cast over the entire production; even the opening Warner Brother's logo begins to crackle and rust. Harry and his chums encounter their most trying hardships and are forced to face numerous deaths. For a children's fantasy, the first leg of the final chapter shaped up to be fairly dark, and that's hardly a fault. This is the path that all of the other Potter films have led up to, lending the doom a sense of importance. The doom must be there to make the ultimate ending worthwhile. <br/><br/>Yet for all the death and destruction, Deathly Hallows never shies away from moments of touching levity. The film allows the major players moments of tender interaction and light comedy. The fact that these bits actually succeed is a testament to the greatly improved abilities of the three principle actors. Director David Yates has broken from the typical Potter tradition of stately, big budget directorial technique and has thrown in splashes of a more kinetic style with a few well-placed, subtle moments of hand-held photography that make Deathly Hallows seem fresher than a few of its predecessors. <br/><br/>Another first: a completely animated sequence. It is an audacious move and it pays dividends. The sequence (detailing the story of the titular Deathly Hallows) is among the finest moments the series has to offer. It is a frightening and beautiful mixture of shadow-play and stop-motion. <br/><br/>One of the film's major assets is its rouge's gallery of uniformly detestable villains. I can think of few characters or actors that can generate the vitriolic response I have when seeing Imelda Staunton in the role of Dolores Umbridge. Joining her are the usual suspects: Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius and Draco Malfoy. These baddies add a real sense of purpose to the proceedings; evil seems to emanate from their very cores. <br/><br/>Yet, to the film's key strength is its acknowledgment of the previous chapters. I felt twinges of melancholy while watching Harry look at his old bedroom below the stairs of the house on Privet Drive, and that speaks to the series' successful attempts at fleshing out the inner lives of these characters and this world. For a major blockbuster, this is a fairly emotional ride.<br/><br/>Deathly Hollows, however, is not without imperfections. The tail end of the second act is a bit saggy, and some of the character behaviors seem contrived. I'm looking at you, Ron Weasley. Also, the film seems to be in a state of perpetual build up to part two. As such, I cannot adequately comment on where I'd place it in relation to the other films. But, as it stands, Deathly Hallows is poised to become the crowning jewel of an already distinguished series of films."
"FutureFilmer","8","1","2","21 November 2010"," This Movie was one of my most anxiously waited movies... and I'm glad it was worth it
","I have been waiting to see this movie for awhile and I was counting down the days until it came out. I wanted to see it the first weekend it came out and glad that I did. It had A lot, and I mean A lot, of scary scenes. If a little child wanted to see this, they should definitely have an older sibling or a parent to go with them.<br/><br/>Both me and my dad wanted to see more of the movie. I could tell where the movie would end. It could've used more story in this part, but I still liked the movie though. I wish Nevel had been in this movie more. He only had one line though. After one part in the movie, I told my dad that I was glad that we weren't watching it in 3D. It would've been a lot more scarier in 3D. That scary part my heart jumped at was at a snake part. Talk about CREEPY!!! My favorite part was when Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron, drank some polyjuice potion and then disguised themselves as people who worked in the Ministry of Magic. It was hilarious! So I really would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Harry Potter. And remember, if little kids want to see this movie, make sure an older person goes with them."
"vipilcholdera","10","1","2","21 November 2010"," somthng
","Before the movie, we talked about how much more fun the Harry Potter franchise would be as a TV show, because that means that each season could be dedicated to a book and use anywhere from 12 hours to 17 hours to tell the story of each book. And some subplots could get their own episodes, like the various love affairs. This would have the benefit of resolving that storyline while isolating it from the darker happenings, and avoiding groaningly awful situations¬Ö On a TV show, you can have entire episodes that only minimally advance the main plot, but fill in the necessary color and resolve subplots. There's so many things that are half-explored that could, on a TV show, get an entire episode or two all to themselves.<br/><br/>Also noted is the following observation: Movies, even those that run nearly 3 hours long, are more like short stories than novels, and TV shows, with the space for digression and intricate plots twists, are more like novels. But in a perverse irony, movies and TV shows have the reverse prestige of short stories and novels, and so the temptation is to take higher prestige novels and turn them into movies. I have no doubt that this was the logic of turning ""Harry Potter"" into movies instead of TV shows. TV seemed too cheap for the series, especially back when they were first selling the story to Hollywood. But in the years since, prestige TV projects like ""The Wire"" and yes, even ""Lost"" have changed the equation considerably. A lot of TV shows are hands-down better than a lot of movies now, especially since the taboo against having intricate plot lines that make it hard to enter the story halfway in have been lifted. Though you probably wouldn't have that problem with ""Harry Potter"", which makes it even more appealing as a TV series. Viewers could enter at any time they'd like, and grasp the basic idea that Voldemort was bad and he's coming back, which would be enough of a hook to get them to stay and piece together the rest."
"stephisthekingpin","7","1","2","21 November 2010"," ""an adequate cliffhanger for the ending of a phenomenon""
","9 years ago the world was first introduced to the courageous trio of companions whom audiences of all ages have embraced. The series has faced the challenges of adolescence, friendship, rivalry & most significantly death. The Final installment of the Harry Potter films ""The Deathly Hallows"" is presented in two parts and primarily deals with love & death which is quite strongly emphasised throughout the story.<br/><br/>The film begins with the urgency of protecting Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) from the almost indestructible Lord Voldermort portrayed by two time Academy Award Nominated* (Ralph Fiennes) who has completed his ascension to power by taking over Hogwarts with his death eaters by his side. After a threatful and rather upsetting escape from an attack, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) continue the work of the late Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) in destroying the remaining Horcruxes which embody the the torn soul of the evil Lord Voldermort. The sacrifice Harry's friends have made in accompanying him on this mission begins to toll on the friendship they once so closely shared, as Ron questions the faith Harry has for Dumbledore due to the lack of guidance and information to pursue. Along the way frantically racing against time whilst the Dark Lord continues to gain power by the day, Harry discovers the existence of the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world known as the ""Deathly Hallows"", which he now understands is the focus behind Voldemort's intentions. To possess the ""Deathly Hallows"" would create the master of death himself, so the lives of the loved ones dearest to them relies on the decisions they now make.<br/><br/>Without the reading of the books or more particularly if you are approaching this film without seeing the previous titles in the series it will be extremely hard to comprehend what's going on. There are dozens of names and references that without having a Potter encyclopedia by your side will mind boggle you. The flowing of the film is also questionable, although it is only Part One and our questions may be answered in Part two.<br/><br/>On a positive note Eduardo Serra's Cinematography should be praised as it's finest the series has seen; particularly the forest sequences and underwater shots in which a climatic sequence between Harry and the destruction of a horcrux takes place. Alexandre Desplat does a fantastic job scoring the film giving it an all new feel to the music world John Williams created for us early in the series, nothing needs to be said about the visual effects which are always visually pleasing. There are no doubts in the acting of our three heroes as Daniel Radcliffe especially has proved himself as a true leading young man. As always fans will be disappointed in the lack of screen time from the unbelievable supporting cast the series has seen; Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman to name a few and newcomers to the set of Potter Bill Nighy along with Rhys Ifans, although what little time they do have they use to their advantage, my favourite being Alan Rickman as ""Severus Snape"" who casting was sublime.<br/><br/>The splitting of the films is an adequate cliffhanger for the ending of a phenomenon and will surely leave the viewer eagerly anticipating Part Two which opens July 2011."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","1","2","21 November 2010"," My personal favourite of the Harry Potter movies so far
","Just for the record, I love the books(for a while Philosopher's Stone was a huge favourite of mine) and I personally like the films. None of them are masterpieces, but they are likable, entertaining and I think well made too. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 with high expectations, there were many friends of mine who said it was brilliant and the best yet. After seeing it with my family last night I have to say Amen! This was a wonderful film in my opinion, and it does a very good job sticking to a mammoth story. I also think they made the right decision splitting it into two parts, if they hadn't the result I think would have been too rushed.<br/><br/>If I do have a criticism here, I do agree that the pacing is rather slow. I think it started and ended brilliantly, it was the middle where it dragged with a lot of admiring the scenery. As beautiful as it was, it didn't admit much to the story.<br/><br/>Criticism aside, I adored the production values. The darker scenes were indeed dark and somewhat bleak, especially the beginning at Malfoy Manor where it looked like a film noir, while the scenery in the middle of the film was gorgeous. The music was another delight, it was sweeping, grandiose, majestic, for me the most complex and most atmospheric of all the Harry Potter movie scores. The script is an improvement too, not that it was terrible in the other movies, but especially I thought the humour was better judged(ie. Moody's comment about the polyjuice potion), while the story despite the slow pacing was never less than engrossing.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes too that I especially liked. One was Dobby's death, I thought it was heart-rending. Dobby was so lovable and funny, and in this instalment cute too I think(loved the trainers), although I knew it was going to happen I couldn't help shedding tears. I think what got me were his last words, they were so poetic and touching. Another was Godric's Hollow, like the former I knew it was coming but it was done in an atmospheric and unnerving way I couldn't help jump. I was also taken with the first ""obliviate"" scene, the regret in Hermione's face and voice made it incredibly poignant, while the 7 Potters chase was both funny and thrilling. My favourite though was the Three Brothers animated sequence. I was wondering how they were going to do that, and after seeing that scene I have to applaud the writers. It was a clever and beautifully done sequence, with some haunting images especially with death. Harry and Hermione's dance got mixed reactions in the cinema, some thought it was awkward and others like me liked it, at that one I thought they were going to kiss which I don't think would have gone down well.<br/><br/>Yates's direction is also much better than it has been. It wasn't bad in the other two films, but here it looked as though he took real charge, and all the pivotal scenes here were in general wonderfully handled. The acting is mostly very good. Daniel Radcliffe is likable enough, and Rupert Grint has great comic timing. Emma Watson I think gives her best performance of the series so far and she steals every scene she's in, while Alan Rickman while not in much is deliciously suave and dour. The two standouts for me were Helena Bonham Carter, whose Bellatrix was powerful and sometimes even scary and Ralph Fiennes who was really quite creepy sometimes without saying much at all. Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour is good but not as memorable, while I do think they wasted the Dursleys.<br/><br/>Overall, a rock solid film that ended in a perfect place and my personal favourite of the series so far. In fact, it makes me all the more excited for the next. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"Jerique","8","1","2","20 November 2010"," Well-crafted adaptation!
","As a fan of the books, first and foremost, I've been displeased with the film series of Harry Potter since ""Prisoner."" However, I believe David Yates and, more importantly, Steve Kloves have redeemed themselves on this one.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part I) follows the book closely. It is very well-crafted. It omits very little, and changes almost nothing. What does get changed or adjusted for time constraints is for the better. I disliked the omitting of Dudley's sentimental words to Harry as the Dursley's depart. However, a change I liked was the fast-paced editing and cutting of scenes. It doesn't feel as long as it does in the book. Much of the scenes that felt like they dragged on in the novel, went along very quickly and smoothly.<br/><br/>A majority of the comedy really works well. My theatre was roaring for a lot of the film. I think that the film's got a lot of awkward comedy this time around. Perhaps the opening scene with the ""seven Potters"" is what sets the tone for the comedic relief. It relieves a lot of the tension (which is a lot) throughout the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the greatest feats in this film is the use of special and visual effects. It really improves on the frequency and the level of use(s) seen in ""Order."" As far as the films are concerned, I believe this one is the best one in the effects departments. However, it's still not much to sneeze at in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Regardless of if you're a book or film fan, Harry Potter 7 (Part I) is a great film and it shouldn't be missed. In addition, Part II is going to be greatly anticipated."
"bradyxplantdude","8","1","2","20 November 2010"," The Best Book-to-Film Adaption Makes For the Best Film in the Series
","When it comes to a film series like Harry Potter, critics and audiences usually have the same expectations for each film released: a formulaic plot, likable but shallow characters, and a story that tends to take a back seat to humor and action. While this is not all that appreciated by fans of the books and critics, this is probably what has kept the Potter film series as enduring as it has, appealing more to mass audiences than hardcore viewers. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" finally breaks this trend and boldly steps away from the action and humor (but don't worry, there's enough to keep the pace up) to give us a much-needed character study of the main trio that has been, mostly, missing since the third film.<br/><br/>Each film in the series can be loosely sorted into a genre of its own: ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" seem to be more children fantasy films, while ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" has some horror elements. ""Goblet of Fire"" is a blatant action movie, but ""Order of the Phoenix"" comes off more as a drama, and ""Half-Blood Prince"" is definitely a teen comedy. ""Deathly Hallows"" takes the best of these (particularly the drama, horror, and action) and mixes them together into a truly memorable film, with quite a few scenes that borderline art house quality when it comes to the character moments (and there are quite a few of these moments). Granted, this story has been known by many the world over for the past three and a half years, a story that has been notorious with its amount of downtime between important moments, and David Yates and co. would have been justified in cutting a lot of this out (and there IS some trimming done), but instead, they really take advantage of the slow moments to get us better acquainted with Harry and his friends than we ever have before as a movie audience.<br/><br/>Before I go on, I want to say that I have avidly read all seven books at least twice each and I have really grown up alongside Harry throughout the years (I am eighteen now), so I know exactly how the story plays out. In past installments, I always considered the book-to-film translations to be hit or miss. While splitting the book into two films may have infuriated some, it's now obvious that it was the best decision that the film makers could have gone with. It's truly like watching the the book playing out in front of your eyes and the scope of the story just cannot be told in one film without loosing its power and meaning. Even scenes added on felt naturally weaved into the story, rather than just tacked on like in previous installments (see ""Half-Blood Prince""). There's one particular scene when Harry and Hermione share a moment while Ron is away that's nowhere to be found in the book, but establishes that they are like brother and sister, nothing sexual in any way. Moments like this my not be in the book, but after seeing them, you wonder how the story could have survived without them.<br/><br/>If I have one particular complaint about this film, it's the soundtrack. Alexandre Desplat, sadly enough, lives up to the ""splat"" in his name, bringing in the blandest, most unoriginal soundtrack in the series. John Williams created some very magical, yet haunting, themes for the first three, while Patrick Doyle brought some exciting stuff to the table, and Nicholas Hooper wrote ""Fireworks"" for movie five. Enough said. Desplat's work feels sorely underwhelming, providing only hints of notes for certain scenes that really needed a blasting fanfare or a somber melody. And above all, it simply does not seem like a Harry Potter soundtrack at all: I kept thinking ""I heard that in The Dark Knight/The Passion/The Da Vinci Code/Pirates of the Caribbean."" The score offers nothing we haven't heard before, making the news of John Williams' absence from Part 2 all the more painful. This is the one blemish that keeps ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" from getting a perfect ten in my book.<br/><br/>If you are a longtime Potter fan, than you will come out of the theater feeling greatly rewarded. Film critics will appreciate it for its character development, book fans will love it because of how well it translates from the novel, and mass audiences will pay for it due to its thrilling action and clever humor. While the soundtrack may take away a little, it's easy to forget that it's even there and to just enjoy what's unraveling on screen. ""Deathly Hallows"" is the Potter film that the world has been waiting for and is what many of the previous films should have been."
"firefox2k","6","1","2","20 November 2010"," A decent beginning for a spectacular ending
","I just came from this movie and thought to myself, ""I wonder why they didn't take this approach in Goblet of Fire?"" personally we ALL know this is for a money-making aspect and has nothing to do with, ""not being able to tell the story in one movie."" If they actually cared about telling the story correctly they would have made G.O.F into 2 movies.<br/><br/>The movie was rushed, and it seemed that they literally took the best parts from each of the beginning chapters and threw them together. Many lines from the movie were taken from the book word for word, kind of a stretch for the other movies, when they tried to stress the point that it is a movie and not a book.<br/><br/>I personally thought the casting or at least the makeup part of the many of the characters were done poorly as well. The Minister of Magic looked nothing liked the description in the book. Supposedly he was a built rugged looking man with a lion manned hair,but they made him a tall scrawny guy who needed a meal or two. Mundungus Fletcher, Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf,not a reject from the sex-pistols. Bill Weasley is stated as tall ruggedly handsome and athletic, not thin skinny emo rocker.<br/><br/>I love the ideal of filming in the ""real world"" however the sets left something to be desired. they seemed very small, crowded and not realistic to be taken as a ""real world"" Gordics Hollow looked like a sound stage, as well did the Lovegoods and Malfoy manor. They could have at least rented a nice mansion in Louisiana for Malfoy Manor.<br/><br/>I have to give the movie a 6 out of 10. I have to be more critical of this due to the fact that they should have all of the aspects down by now after all these movies. I will say as far as all the movies in the series goes, this one would be in the top 3...so far...not as good as Order of the Phoenix or Sorcerers Stone but better than Goblet of Fire, depending on how it ends."

","Harry Potter's penultimate film journey is an immediate smash, judiciously mixing mythology, romance, teenage lifestyles, lowbrow comedy, adult themes, and nonstop action into a blizzard of entertainment that really could be conjured up only by a wizard who kicked butt in his or her O.W.L. exam. This first-half-of-the-last-book movie is exceptional and suffers only from a weird shift in tone near the middle of the film.<br/><br/>If you have never read a Harry Potter book, this is not the movie for you to watch. Please don't watch it. You'll spend most of the movie muttering to whomever is closest, asking who these characters are and what are they doing and why are they flushing themselves down toilets (the better to get into the Ministry, my dear), and so on. Face it; you're quite the Muggle and will have no chance of comprehending this movie.<br/><br/>For the rest of you... Well, even if you haven't read the seventh (and final) book, you should be able to follow along. I'll try hard not to spoil anything for you, but some things from the earlier books may creep in, so beware.<br/><br/>The movie begins a few days before Harry's 17th birthday, and the Dudley family is leaving their home out of concern for their own safety. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is to be escorted to The Burrow and live with the Weasely family until the school year begins, but he and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have another plan: to find the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which the evil Lord Voldemort has spliced parts of his soul (self preservation, you see).<br/><br/>For the first time in the series, the school of Hogwarts doesn't make an appearance. Harry and his pals, under the indirect order of Albus Dumbeldore, need to find these objects before Voldemort gains any more strength; the Dark Lord, of course, is making great headway into running things anyway, what with his Death Eaters and his infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.<br/><br/>As with the rest of the books and movies, there are dual plots. There's the obvious line of the search for the remaining Horcruxes, and there's the subtle look at the way the trio is growing up, wary of their feelings for one another. One of the more remarkable aspects of J. K. Rowling's books is that she tries to accurately depict the lives of average teenagers - even if the teenagers themselves aren't average at all. So here, we see Ron and Hermione grudgingly accepting how much each means to the other, which leads to confusing and conflicting feelings on their parts as well. All normal for teenagers, and all well done.<br/><br/>A word of caution, if you haven't read the book: good people die. Don't ask me who; I can't tell you. But it's the last book in the series, and there are a lot of secondary and tertiary characters - surely not all of them would be expected to make it, right? Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing their roles for almost a full decade now, and their chemistry is palpable on screen. As usual, they are surrounded by a solid British cast, including Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody), David Thewlis (Remus Lupin), Bill Nighy (Rufus Scrimgeour), Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy), Michael Gambon (Dumbledore), and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). Each plays his or her part with all expected prowess, but rising above all of them is Mrs. Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the nefarious Bellatrix Lestrange with a maniacal glee that borders on pure insanity. Her eye alone has depth.<br/><br/>Here's the only part of the entire movie that just didn't work for me. There is a long stretch in which our heroes search valiantly for the Horcruxes, and during that time there's a bit of a disagreement, causing one of them to leave the other two. Afterwards, the way the remaining two behave - in one scene - almost justifies the anger of their departed friend, thus shifting the tone a little bit. This isn't in the book at all, and I found it a bit worrisome. Why muddy the waters? It's complicated enough for the characters without more drama for the sake of drama.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows, by the way, are magical artifacts, and one of the big questions in the book is whether the three should search for these mythical Hallows or continue to look for the Horcruxes. Doesn't matter much, as they are all intertwined.<br/><br/>Eduardo Serra's cinematography is breathtaking, particularly the first battle scene after Harry leaves the Dudley's house and the battles in the forest and at stately Malfoy Manor. Serra replaced Bruno Delbonnel, who reportedly was afraid he'd begin to repeat himself. But no matter, because the film by no means has a different look or feel than the previous entries (except that the subject matter is even darker, of course).<br/><br/>If you have read the seventh book, you might wonder how this movie ends; where's a good stopping point? Again, I won't reveal that here, but when you see the movie you'll probably agree that it ends appropriately. I mean, this isn't like Back to the Future II, which was cynically used just to set up III; this is a standalone movie that's really supposed to be in conjunction with a companion movie anyway.<br/><br/>As a fan of the Harry Potter books and subsequent movies, I feel that the seventh movie is as outstanding as I expected it would be. Aside from the one strange tonal shift - which is quickly shifted back - there's really very little wrong with this movie, and most people should find it very enjoyable."

","I love the books. I like the films. They're watchable at best. Philosophers Stone and Chamber Of Secrets were faithful though lacked any particular style and fell in with most generic early noughties fantasy films. Prisoner Of Azkaban took a more stylistic approach and managed to capture a medieval look. The Goblet Of fire (the first of the big ones) in my opinion was utter shambles. The acting was inferior to the others, the style seemed to attempt to copy its predecessor with little success and the comedy was forced, staged and unfunny. Order Of the Pheonix tried to cram a lot of story into a short space of time. Clever ideas and directorial sharpness kept it from falling the way Goblet had. Though Yates had much to celebrate with Order of the Pheonix, Halfblood prince seemed to skim the book leaving gaping holes in a pretty simplistic plot. The romance between Potter and Ginny Weasley was hopelessly unengaging and both actors lacked any chemistry.<br/><br/>This film is probably the most faithful to the books. The books narrative is the final installment is written like it should be translated to film, so the cross over shouldn't have been as hard as the others. Being in two halves was definitely the correct approach though the end of this film annoyed me some what. I know the ending, but I am now desperate to see the next one. To me thats job well done to director David Yates, his third of four Potter films. The action is well timed, the horror is just enough to make adult feel a slight amount of dredd, and may only give kids nightmare for a day or two, which in opinion is a good thing. The ""adult"" cast once again tower over the teens, but with less screen time for the ""adults"" the teens are not dwarfed like in previous installments. The film though grim and gritty, is beautifully shot cinematography is superb once again and the special effects are amazing to say the least.<br/><br/>I was really not holding out much hope for Deathly Hallows part 1, but I was pleasantly surprised. Virtually anyone who has watched the others will go see this one, but rest assured to those that are let down by the films as I have been time after time, this one could well be the best outing. Bring on part 2."
"Lifexinxrewind","8","1","2","20 November 2010"," Another strong entry to the series!
","Likes: The 3 main actors did some of their best work, they have really grown over the years and fleshed out these characters to an impressive degree. They provide the most emotional scenes of the HP films. The direction is great, providing the most realistic of the films and a great layer of dread and suspense over everything. The few moments of comic relief are effectively subtle, I enjoyed the lack of silliness and slapstick gags. The beginning with Hermoine making her parents forget her was well done and powerful. The ""heist"" section was fun and interesting. The Voldemort dinner was effectively chilling. Great stuff all around in the scene where they finally destroy the horcrux. Hot evil Hermoine is hot. The action chase in the opening was great. I liked the multiple Harry's and the humor that provided, and the visuals were cool during the flight on the motorcycle. Really awesome camera work and cinematography, providing visuals that furthered the sense of them being all alone in their quest. By not having to rush things the audience gets a much better feel for the frustrating setting for our heroes. In the brief time he is on screen, Alan Rickman once again makes Snape one of the most engaging characters in the series. This film is up their with the best produced entries, quite a feat considering it goes up against the magnificent Prisoner of Azkaban. While I wouldn't say it's the best technically made film, it's probably second best. I've enjoyed seeing the series get darker and more atmospheric as it goes. For the first time there is actual realistic danger towards the characters, which adds a lot. This is one film that carries great emotion weight, giving it the necessary feel to make the audience care leading into the climactic events.<br/><br/>Dislikes: Although some important events took place, not quite enough happens plot wise for my tastes. Definitely not enough Snape! Missed seeing a lot of the other characters, many of whom were given brief cameos in the beginning and never seen again. Dobby's death was fairly cheesy and failed to make me care that much. Perhaps it was due to not reading the books, but since Dobby hadn't been seen since Chamber of Secrets it seemed convenient to bring him back just to save them and get killed off. It wasn't bad, I just didn't really care. Although the character development was necessary and appreciated, there was a few scenes that dragged a bit as I itched to get the plot moving again. (I will say this beats the film feeling rushed, as we felt in Goblet of Fire). The dark nature of the film unfortunately means there is much less of the fun, adventurous feeling some of the other entries provide, which means while this one is totally necessary for the series as a whole, it wouldn't be my first choice to pop in and watch over and over. A few of the characters come in without so much as an introduction and it wasn't made clear why they were important. They just get introduced, and either turn into a bad guy or exit. I still have no clue what the deal is with the shard of glass, and am unsure whether I am supposed to know. (if it is important to not know, and it will be revealed in the next film, please avoid spoiling it for me). Also, there is the expected effect of the ending feeling anti-climactic. It just sneaks up and provides a stopping point to lead into the next film. Just when it was getting good, right?<br/><br/>Overall: This is easily one of the strongest entries in the Harry Potter series, providing fantastic atmosphere and emotional weight. While I would still rate The Prisoner of Azkaban and the under-rated Half-Blood Prince ahead of it, it is definitely above the rest of the installments. Deathly Hallows part 1 continues the tradition of solid films and its flaws probably couldn't have been avoided due to the nature of it being mostly set-up. That being said, this is about as good as it could have been and makes me more than eager to see the conclusion next July. I support the decision to split the final film into two parts because it allowed us to see these characters grow so much more without having to rush the plot more. And that evil Hermoine needs to make another appearance!<br/><br/>Final score 8/10"

","Voldemort's power is growing stronger. He now has control over the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. <br/><br/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to finish Dumbledore's work and find the rest of the Horcruxes to defeat the Dark Lord. <br/><br/>But little hope remains for the Trio, and the rest of the Wizarding World, so everything they do must go as planned..<br/><br/>after seeing the Half blood Prince, i was not looking forward to this entry in the series one bit. They have cut the film into two to make more money (even though the makers say it's to elaborate the story, i can't remember a dance sequence in the book), and Yates was back to direct the film again.<br/><br/>Yates has usurped himself this time and brought ut a fast paced, witty and sometimes downright frightening (I hate snakes) entry into the long running series.<br/><br/>even thought the majority of the film is the trio camping and trying o find a way to destroy an amulet, the action really never lets up in the films lengthy run times.<br/><br/>okay, the film can feel a little like a quest for a certain ring sometimes with the three of them walking along the countryside and sometimes arguing and letting certain things influence their minds, but this is a minor quibble in what has to be the best Potter film since 'Prisoner'.<br/><br/>The three leads do not look like they are reading straight from the books now, and they even get a little bit saucy throughout, in fact the script is packed with innuendo<br/><br/>'it's ten inches but nothing special'<br/><br/>'thats a strange thing to wear in your sock'<br/><br/>but this only adds to the entertainment factor.<br/><br/>The only real problem with the film is the slew of Brit actors who were quite famous when the first film was released, now, just standing in the background not really doing anything but looking thankful for being in the film (Mark Williams come forward) and this happens quite regularly that it can become distracting.<br/><br/>But the real treat is the animated segment of the deathly hallows, very surreal and very eerie, perhaps the most involving bit of the film.<br/><br/>Feinnes oozes menace whenever he is onscreem and easily steals the film from under everyone involved, closely followed by Watson.<br/><br/>If you look a little closer in the connotations of the film, it's all going a little bit Star Wars, but that should not hinder such a well made movie and such a good step up from the dirge of the last film.<br/><br/>See it now and then moan for eight months until part 2.<br/><br/>But it's nice to have that feeling again, so long after the end of the two towers finished."
"eric_dx24","7","1","2","19 November 2010"," A great start for a great end
","Not the best Harry Potter Film, that one goes to Cuaron and his great work with Prisoner of Azkaban but this one grabs a seat as a great thrill ride towards a conclusion fans have waited for for a long time. The dim, quiet rushes through forests and the tension between Ron and Harry, with Hermione in a disposition, delivers in a way that the audience, especially fans of the book, would appreciate. Seeing an in depth focus on the characters and Harry's descent toward helplessness and doubt towards Dumbledore's intentions and his own intentions for the greater good of the whole wizarding world.<br/><br/>This is a movie that reeled me in as a fan, seeing the emotions written in every page of the book brought to life by Steve Kloves' mastery and David Yates' artistry. By the final scene, they leave you unfulfilled (as a predisposed part 1 should) but a with joy nonetheless. One more thing: The Tale of the Three Brothers was great animation, great story telling, and wonderful by itself."

","Well I wouldn't bother to mention the story here as the whole world by now knows what the film is all about. However, for those who haven't read the books, this part 1 of the epic finale is about how the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione leave their comfort zones and set out on the hunt for the Horcruxes (things in which Voldemort has concealed a parts of his soul). During their journey they face all kinds of challenges, emotional as well as dangerous, and also learn about the tale of the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>Now let me get straight to the point. The film sets the dark tone right from the word 'go'; this perhaps is the darkest film in the series. David Yates and Steve Kloves have tried to be absolutely faithful to the book and they succeed to do so with all the major sequences present in the film almost ditto to the book. This is the first brownie point for the duo. The telling is a little different from the rest of the Potter films though, as this time Hogwarts is nowhere in the scheme of things. The film cannot be assessed completely, I believe, as it's not complete, not even in itself. Thus I think it'd be only fair to assess the whole of Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2, combined. However, this is my take on what I felt about DH-Part 1.<br/><br/>Acting: The film fully belongs to the trio. The young brigade's hard work shows; particularly Rupert Grint, who plays Ron with complete √©lan. Dan, Rupert and Emma prove that they're capable of lifting the burden of the entire film on their young shoulders. They manage to grab eyeballs even when only one of them is on screen. They've done a marvelous job and this is the best combined effort of the three, by far. Other notable performances are that of Helena Bonham Carter as the nasty Bellatrix Lestrange (she's superb at belittling), and the menacing Dark Lord (Ralph Fiennes).<br/><br/>Cinematography: Eduardo Serra had a greater challenge on hand than the past cinematographers of the series as this time majority of the action happens in the exteriors. The Portuguese has taken some exceptional shots involving landscapes, barren lands and woods. He's done a great job especially in the Malfoy Manor and Godric's Hollow scenes. Some of the shaky cam shots are brilliant.<br/><br/>Music: I for one didn't quite like Alexandre Desplat's music; perhaps I was too engrossed in the telling and the visuals. But I can surely say there's nothing extraordinary about it. However, the very first soundtrack, Obliviate, is a gem. <br/><br/>Editing: Mark Day has done a fine job by cutting the scenes at crucial points where the telling becomes more than effective. It's contemporary and gives the feel of edginess and anxiety.<br/><br/>Screenplay: Steve Kloves has woven the most important and intriguing situations and detailed them so well that you live virtually every moment of it and yet do not get even a wee bit bored. The scenes are weighed so perfectly in all terms that the film doesn't falter anywhere; you get a full dose of every genre.<br/><br/>Direction: There could've been no other better director than David Yates to direct this one; simply because of two strong reasons. 1) He's a master when it comes to emotions, which is the most important factor in DH-Part 1 with the trio put in all sorts of situations. And 2) Because he's already worked with the cast in OOTP and HBP, therefore he knows exactly what could be extracted from each individual. Besides, his take on the majority of the sequences is untainted and enriching. This one is a class act by Yates.<br/><br/>Highlights <br/><br/>1. They've shown Hermione's house for the first time. 2. All the Death Eaters at the table. 3. Fred and George's short but effective comic relief. 4. The entire Ministry of Magic sequence involving the trio. 5. Harry and Ron's fight. 6. The Harry and Hermione dance in the absence of Ron. 7. Destroying the locket. 8. The Tale of Three Brothers visuals and narration. 9. Dobby (A tear trickled down my cheek when he died). 10. Malfoy Manor confrontation.<br/><br/>Lows <br/><br/>1. The aerial fight in the 7 Potters scene could've been better. 2. Voldemort missing from the Bathilda Bagshot/ Nagini scene at Godric's Hollow. 3. Mad Eye's death is insignificant. (I hope Snape has a better death) 4. Pettigrew doesn't die, forget the silver hand. 5. None of the Order members appear ever again, after the trio leaves the burrow.<br/><br/>However, I feel these lows are too weak to shatter the greatness of this epic. In short, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 is spectacular and full of entertainment good enough to keep you at the edge of your seats and your eyes glued to the big screen for 146 minutes. It's worth watching twice and even thrice. On a second thought, how about 7 times!!!!"
"dennis_chiu1","10","1","2","19 November 2010"," The Highest Praise
","Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is both at once the darkest and brightest star in the franchise's constellation of film adaptations. It is darkest in its detailed depiction of Harry's hero saga during his most horrible days, and brightest in story, acting and poignancy.<br/><br/>In this faithful adaptation of the first half of J.K. Rowling's penultimate novel of the boy wizard who lived, an evil shadow has fallen across the United Kingdom as Lord Voldemort grows in power and control. Evil lurks around every corner and there is no time for birthdays, weddings and other happy occasions. This is a time for mourning the fallen, and retreating for cover until a champion rises to lead the good and brave to victory. This is also a time where young love must bloom in a freezing cold winter and deep friendships provide the only warmth and relief.<br/><br/>It is in this bleakness where we see, more clearly than ever, the heart of Harry James Potter and the loyalty of his friends Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have never been better in their roles, and there is an epiphany where the audience realizes that its emotional investment in these actors and films has yielded a reward greater than it could possibly have imagined.<br/><br/>This is the true triumph of these Harry Potter films -- that they payoff in some proportion to how their original written source material paid off for readers. Rarely do films ever approach a climax equal to an extraordinary literary experience.<br/><br/>The film production is handsome as it gives the audience the great gift of panoramic vistas of England's windswept moors, rugged forests, and overcast shores that are inserted between suspenseful action sequences in London coffee shops, muggle filled streets and inside the Ministry of Magic.<br/><br/>Having read the books many times, I know how everything will end, but I now know, having seen the first part on film, that when Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 runs its last reel this summer, that I will relive all of the giddiness, glory, sadness and sorrow that I felt when I finished the last Harry Potter book.<br/><br/>That is the highest praise I can give any film."

","How would you not want to, but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - The most awaited film premieres in 2010. Beginning were only waiting for the true film fans, and the usual audience had no idea that he would soon find himself in the fascinating world of dreams. Shrek's waited all this and would like the final, but even the most devoted fans wanted to see exactly Potter. And Harry was one competitor in this unequal war, but the Twilight that time had a crowd of anti-fans, and, frankly, the film failed. Oh yeah, by the way half of all those special women not so long ago fanatic from the boy in the glasses, hence the conclusion: all waiting for Potter. To laugh, to surprise, to pass the evening to see half-naked Radcliffe. In general, the reasons are many - the movie alone. And this movie before you.<br/><br/>The entire saga of a simple boy started perfectly with children's books and stories. There was no drama, at least it was not so noticeable. If Harry and was sad that only parents, but the universal problem not his concern. Anyone he did not like, but no one, and not hated. But he grew up and grew older. It is true that Harry himself to younger actors playing his role and gives here is not a game, a trivial features of male face. By the way, and Hermione something prettier from film to film. And Ron and all the boy-bull. Overgrown, unshaven. But it's not in it, and that the final part would have to show us the drama. And all this was going.<br/><br/>Titled book shows us the real drama. It had everything: from human relations to the great battles outlined. And a thorough study of Nutra characters and love heroes. And anyway, there was a lot of things are mixed, but it's not about the book and the movie, which is sounding name - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Idea to divide the book into two parts, liking a lot. And it is not surprising, since previous screening was blamed for their dissimilarity with the original text. But here, we got what we wanted, though the book was not divided evenly. The second part promises mere unbridled epic and beautiful effect, but now everything is on the first part.<br/><br/>Of the plot do not want to say, because those 20-plus chapters transferred appallingly-apocryphal. Yes, the reason of all - desire for money. It is no secret that the drama Yates did just action. There is no dramatic images of the main characters, and quarrels as if from scratch. Love line Hermione and Ron all of a sudden disappeared and never appeared. Frequent displeasure Dumbledore gave way to dry a pair of similar phrases that have only a trivial sense, like: ""Oh, how it's bad that we did not say anything."" About Rita Skitter and its articles of speech is not at all, but in fact they forced to question the clean white mag. Many times povycherkival quite ugly. For example, a conversation Dudley and Harry in the book truly makes you think, but here it is not at all. The Ministry of Magic at a wedding in the beginning of the story, talk about stick and krestrazha, uncertainty about the pop Harry Deathly Hallows, and finally, loving languor of Jeannie - it is all or none, or shown ugly-honest. No drama at all, but all show reduced fine words and disaffected persons heroes.<br/><br/>Well they showed their faces? Not to say that much, but Ron does not look at the age of eighteen and believe in what he became so evil simply can not, because in the book, this process took, if not half of the book, the couple heads for sure. Blame the actors in it, but do not even pulled the film. Helena Bonham Carter and Ralph Fiennes - two real genius. That they should praise and love. They did this picture of a beautiful and vibrant, thanks to its superb, amazing game. Another good Bill Nighy in the image of Rufus Scrimgeour, but very sorry that it so early was killed.<br/><br/>The entire film is like the only one - then, as the plot. It looks good and looks stylistically-perfect. Dark colors, dark music. Echoes of humor almost everywhere, but laughter can bring only seven Potters In all other important points erased and nothing but a dance tent, a separate thank you very much. It was excellent, to the point and most importantly - moving to madness.<br/><br/>Yes, as a film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - not the best option, but as just a film - excellent beautiful, bright sight. Partly, of course, is not all clear, and those who read the book (I, incidentally, one of them) are likely to watch this movie out of curiosity and rejoice for the fact that the saga will end is not so. I recommend watching, not reading books, and walked seven films in a row. The effect is guaranteed. But fans of this wonderful story about a simple guy with a funny round glasses I wish only that the wait is not as long, and that Yates will consist of 10-15 chapters present a feast of visual, stylistic and conceptual ideas."

","The effects are of course, amazing, but really, this part one of part seven is so boring. The joy and youth of all the previous films are gone which is understandable, but the trio of protagonists, Harry, Hermonie and Ron have a road trip of sorts. Largely left to their own devices, I wanted Harry to wave his magical wand around and hurry proceedings up. The darkest and most glum of the films, Lord Voldemort is the personification of evil. He wants to take over the world, not just Hogwarts and the Ministry of magic. The acting is super, all casting is perfect with Helena Bonham Carter a standout. The anticipation of a big cliffhanger will be on the minds of all watching as the audience is aware the finale is not released until July. All I can say is the fireworks have yet to be lit. Take in an extra choc-top this is a sedate film to say the least, however, fans won't mind a bit. There is a clever animated sequence that explains exactly what the deathly hallows are by the way, over all, slick but slow."

"TheNabOwnzz","5","1","3","28 June 2018"," A gorgeous bunch of nothing
","There is no doubt that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the weakest entry in the Harry Potter franchise, which furthermore makes me doubt the weird decision of splitting this adaption into two separate films, since basically nothing ever happens in its 2 hour 26 running time.<br/><br/>The cinematography is once again astonishing. While not as good as Azkaban's or Half-Blood Prince's cinematography, cinematographer Eduardo Serra does manage to create some beautiful images in this film, but in truth these are images for the sake of being images and not much else, since our three heroes spend hours in some forest in the outdoors while the direction focuses on a couple bits of melodrama & inner struggles, which ofcourse succeeds greatly as a time filler, but in the end it has little context. It starts off with this weird escape from the Dursleys towards the Weasley home ( which i thought was destroyed in Half-Blood Prince, but i guess nothing has to make sense in this movie ), even though the Dursleys was not the place we left off in Half-Blood Prince, making me even doubt how they got there in the first place without the death eaters interfering. Ofcourse, with tension for the sake of being tension they somehow do manage to find the crew when they travel back from the Dursleys, and after some death and injuries they afterwards decide to have a wedding party, which in itself is ofcourse asking for trouble, and it makes little sense in the context of what is happening.<br/><br/>We also have a scene at the start to show how 'evil' Voldemort is and how we are supposed to hate him, with some unknown woman who is supposedly a teacher at Hogwarts as captive being killed for liking muggle-wizard connections. Unfortunately, this is not a very subtle way of forcing the audience to direct their emotions of hatred towards him, and since films should always leave that choice to the viewer themselves, or atleast pick a known character to be killed, this scene, like most in Part 1, is a time filler and nothing else.<br/><br/>It is a film that is very different from previous Potter films since it seems to be a documentary about forests and outdoor scenery instead of something that is supposed to have an actual plot. The connection between the three main characters has never been worse as it was in the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. All three of them bicker and argue amongst themselves and none of them create any sympathy for the viewer, except maybe Hermione ( Emma Watson ). The biggest problem with this motion picture is that it is simply going nowhere. All the melodrama between Harry, Ron & Hermione is just such obvious filler while they try to charm the audience with its cinematography that it becomes an obvious wasted effort, and after the ending you will probably wonder 'Is that it?', since absolutely nothing happens.<br/><br/>It has often been cited as 'Too slow', but that is not the problem at all. The problem is the entire plot is so vacuous of structure and payoff, and while most slow movies have a general core for its narrative or seem to be going somewhere, literally nothing ever brings a payoff in Deathly Hallows Part 1, it simply drowns in all its melodrama and the need to split the novel into two parts. The few action sequences that are there feature a lot of shakycam like Harry Potter has turned into a Jason Bourne film so you can no longer have any idea about what is going on. It hurts the eyes to watch, and it also hurts the eyes to witness this sluggish bunch of nonsense that never goes anywhere.<br/><br/>If you enjoy documentairies with great cinematography about forests and general outdoor scenery, this is the film to watch. Otherwise, as something that is not intended as purely a time filler, and having an actual narrative structure, it fails on every aspect, since absolutely nothing seems to happen during the entire course of the film."
"DreadfulA","6","1","3","24 December 2017"," ""I require your wand?""
","Said Voldemort to Lucius Malfoy. A very suggestive line right there, makes me chuckle everytime. Seriously though, I mean, this seems to be a serious movie, right? It's just so hard to take it seriously, because you don't feel any danger and for that don't really care about the characters either. Deathly Hallows should be the grand finale of Harry Potter saga, but manages mostly to bore you with its endless running sequences that seem to go nowhere. Every now and then Harry and co stop on their tracks and speculate things, just because the plot requires so. Even the rivalry between Harry and Ron was written poorly and was not believable, although nice idea.<br/><br/>Best aspects of the movie are cinematography and acting, which for the most part is pretty good. Worst is Voldemort, who is also the biggest problem here. He's a jester, not an evil wizard that raises terror. You don't fear him, because his dialogue, manners and whole appearance are silly. He looks like a fragile cancer patient who is asking for a slap by acting like an idiot. Why won't someone just punch him in that bald face and be done with it. He's no Sauron or Lord Sidious or anyone who has intelligence and true might to challenge the world. He just flattens the whole saga and makes Harry's ordeal meaningless.<br/><br/>Early scene where Hermione erased her muggle parents' memories of her was quite effective. But I think the magic also affacted me, because it's hard to recollect any other scene or moment that made an impression. At least Deathly Hallows part 1 is better than part 2, which was horrible and ""short"" for a Potter movie, just waste of space."
"PatrynXX","9","1","3","29 October 2017"," Way better than the second part.
","Whereas the second part contains all the action thus almost no substance, and skips around , totally chaotic wants to get done faster than it should. This one was much better off. Yes there is more dialogue but that was to be expected, it's a long book. It didn't rush things, and added some humor to it now and then. Not entirely sure why the second one gets better ratings. I assume people prefer action over substance. The only real substance in part 2 is Snape's end.. other than that , part 2 is way too short. Totally missed the great elf uprising. Like someone hit panic after the end of this movie. Think Peter Jackson did it better splitting 2 movies into 3 on which it's based on a single tiny book and still made it worth while. (Hobbit) So of the two I prefer this one. Maybe this will change with time but the last movie is so utterly confusing I'd rather read the book again. And probably makes zero sense to those who haven't. Keep expecting like a 30 minute extended edition to popup.<br/><br/>Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 6/10 (it's a dialogue movie go figure) Replayable:6/10 (second movie maybe more so just to doublecheck what isn't making sense and still doesn't."
"zkonedog","9","1","3","6 March 2017"," Maybe They Should Have Done All The Later Movies Like This
","After about ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" (movie #3), I felt that the movies based on books 4-6 really just didn't do the novels their true justice (especially the ""Order of the Phoenix"" and ""Half-Blood Prince"" films). By that point, the books were long past the simpler tales of ""Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", and as a result they inevitably glossed over so many key parts of the series. Fortunately, the movie producers realized that such an approach just would not work for the magnitude of the final Potter installment, and thus the project was split in half. The best choice that could have possibly been made, IMHO.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Deathly Hallows 1"" sees Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) searching for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) remaining Horcruxes. While the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts fall pretty much completely under Death Eater control, the trio learn about the Deathly Hallows and the endgame for Voldemort's master plan begins to take shape.<br/><br/>There is no lag in this film whatsoever. It starts off with a bang and never looks back (just like the book). Yet, it is not just an ""action extravaganza"" like I perceived ""Order of the Phoenix"" to be. It is also filled with nuanced character performances, humor, and a sense of gravitas (provided by director David Yates) that makes the whole experience very well-rounded.<br/><br/>Until recently, I really wasn't a fan of the ""part one"", ""part two"" concept of filmmaking. However, after seeing the success of this film (and the more recent ""Hobbit"" trilogy), I now am wondering if perhaps this is the way that books should be parlayed into movies all the time. A film like this allows for many more of J.K. Rowling's little nuances to show up instead of things feeling rushed and glossing over a good many plot points. Had, for example, ""Order of the Phoenix"" been done this way, I think I would have liked it a great deal more."
"ebhae-34976","9","1","3","12 November 2016"," The best Harry Potter movie.
","(This review contains no big spoilers)<br/><br/>Why why why is this movie consider just one of many Harry Potter movie and a perfect build up to part two, this is in my opinion the best Harry Potter movie even as a stand alone film and i will explain why.<br/><br/>The movie starts with that Harry will be moved from hes house because hes have been 16 and the spell of hes mothers love have now been broken. We also seen the villains(the Death Eaters) and that Snape have been one of them. They tell us that they have a deceiver among the ministry and that they know that Harry Potter will move. We also know they will try to take control over the ministry. So Harry and hes companies meet the Death Eaters in an epic fight. Harry survives and after that they went to Bill(one of Rons bigger brother) wedding, the death eaters take over the ministry and Harry Ron and Hermione have to flee. At the same time Harry wants to find the Hokruxes to destroy Voldermort.<br/><br/>From there on the movie is just plain excellent. It happens so much after that are all linked together in a beautiful way. They also used some connections with was happening early in the movie for example in the beginning of the movie the minister give Harry Ron and Hermione three different objects that both Ron and Hermione used later in the film but Harrys objects function they keep to part 2. The tone is also great it really feels like a dark movie which it is. Because we really have to worry about the friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione which we love so much at the same time it is more important than ever to stay together. But that doesn't mean this movie not have any humor. The reaction when they should flash down the toilet to give one example is really funny. This movie also have a parallel story with the deathly hallows that they used in a good way because it is sometimes important to make the story go forward. The way the story about the deathly hallows is told is just cheer brilliant. <br/><br/>I have some complains about the movie. First thing is a scene were they running, the way it's shot is just not my kind of stile. The second thing is that this movie or the part two don't tell us that Voldemorts name has been banned and every time you say it Death eaters comes. That is in the book and that you don't know it makes for some confusing moments. The third thing is more a complain about part two, but it is a scene were you wonder were comes this Hocrux from and it's told in the book. The fourth thing is re watch-ability. I usually think a movie is best the second time you see it. But this movie have been a bit less good with each watching.<br/><br/>This is my favorite British movie and my 10th favorite movie of all time right now."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (2010): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter: First part of an exciting franchise conclusion. There is an interesting back story regarding what the Deathly Hallows refers too but symbolically is makes no real claims. The young heroes are older and the evil lord Voldemort wants young wizard Harry Potter dead so to avoid this Potter is put under protection. Eventually they are on a quest to destroy a locket that contains part of Voldemort's soul. Director David Yates is a veteran in these films and here he nears the characters closer to doom. The ending is a cliffhanger but a satisfactory one where self sacrifice becomes the norm. Daniel Radcliffe as Potter is at his most responsible as he takes charge of his life to face the inevitable. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasily struggles with emotions that cause friction but he renders his biggest victory when faced with deception. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is invaluable with her intelligence and well placed magic. Finally there is Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort whose presence is ominous in his search for a powerful wand that can out match Potter's. His final scene opens the door nicely for part 2. It also should be noted that Helena Bonham Carter plays one hell of a superb psychotic bitch. These films were always entertaining but young children need discernment before viewing. Fantastic special effects abound include an exciting motorcycle chase through the skies, looming large serpents, and an enchanting world full of surprises. Score: 7 / 10"

","I understand that there is a group of people who don't like this movie because there is no Hogwarts. It is a movie who is different than the others in the series.<br/><br/>The film starts out amazing with scenes which gives the Die Hard Harry Potter fans Goosebumps. The speech of Scrimgeour is absolutely outstanding it really is exciting. The scene after that made me feel sad and I realized as Die Hard Harry Potter fan that it was going to end very soon. A very sad period would follow. The scene was when Harry said Good-Bye to his uncle and aunt. The beginning was really beautifully filmed. So I was satisfied. I was under the impression of those people who thought it was not necessarily to split this film into 2 movies. Like David Heyman said, they never did it why would we do it now ? But looking at the book you realize there is so much going to happen in seven you had to split it up. There were so many important story lines that had to be told. Unfortunately they had to split it up. Although every extra Potter movie is a good I had not any problems with it ones it was confirmed.<br/><br/>This movie is all about the Horcruxes and it is nice to see that they finally start that they destroy them. They did a good job working on the storyline because the focus needed to be mostly on the Horcruxes, and you have to see that it is hard to do it. Between those scenes it is amazing to see how dangerous Voldemort actually is. You realize it is a serious business what he was up to. This film is a good introduction to the last part of the franchise.<br/><br/>Unlike most people I spoke with I did like this film. There was a huge character development in this movie especially the scenes between the main characters , which I absolutely loved because as actors they really improved in this film. It was amazing to see. What I also loved in cinematic ways were the emotional scenes in Godderics Hollow and of course the scene where Dobby dies. The scene where he dies was absolutely heartbreaking. In cinema this boy of 9-years old was sitting beside me and I swear I saw tears in his eyes. I the movie it hit me more than in the book. Personally it was better in the movie I think, because Dobby actually says things. Dobby was amazing in this movie Toby Jones gave a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>I will give this film 9 out of 10 : there were so many strong scenes and the story of the Deathly Hallows was told exactly the way I hoped they would. And the performance of the actors were outstanding. I was very satisfied about how they started their journey of the Deathly Hallows. What I further have to add is how amazing was the character development for Draco Malfoy. I didn't expect much scenes for Tom Felton in this movie but again he played his part so amazing. His character developed really. That was great! And he played that on a way I could really appreciate. Let's keep the show going on!"
"GeorgeRoots","7","1","3","29 August 2014"," Why Two Parts? Either Way, The Finale Is Around The Corridor.
","Upon hearing of a 2-part finale, as well as the conversion to 3-D. Your instant thought, or at least mine and many other peoples were ""Is it really necessary""? Well luckily for us, they couldn't convert it to 3D in time for it's release date. to be honest I'm all up for a 2-part finale, as long as the get every bit in and send an incredibly beloved series off right.<br/><br/>It was a bold move, and after watching ""Part 2"". I can confidently say that the 3D was completely unnecessary, and they could have easily gotten away with one movie. The only thing I can say wrong about ""Part 1"" is the pacing. It starts off well, and then we're stuck in the woods for two hours. It's incredibly slow and where it ends never really bothered me, but it can't help but be crippled by how much they would get done in the second.<br/><br/>Another thing I found strange, was that virtually out of nowhere dance that happens between Harry and Hermione. It's not bad or worth anything of a critical backlash, but it was just as awkward for us as it was for them. Aside from that it was really good. The trio are not going back to Hogwarts, and instead are on a private mission to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Tensions arise between the three in all kinds of various landscapes, as well as the head bureaucracy of wizards itself.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: The acting was good, by this point it was so good to see that the final newcomers to the series would be Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans. Sadly though, this was also the time to be saying goodbye to Harry and his friends, as the finale would not even give you the time to do so. 7/10."
"Tyson14","10","1","3","17 August 2014"," A necessary and fitting buildup to the grand conclusion
","Walking out of the screening, one of my friends remarked that he hated this Harry Potter film, stating it is the ""worst"" in the series. I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1 is just buildup.<br/><br/>If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticise anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.<br/><br/>Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron. In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine. The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.<br/><br/>The deathly Hallows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part."

","Wow. This movie was incredible. It is one part of the finale, yes, but that only means that they can pack even more storyline into the two-and-a-half hour movie. No, it's not as wondrous as the others, but that's because it's 'all grown up,' as it were. WARNING: Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>In this movie, Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on the quest that they've been unknowingly preparing for since their first year at Hogwarts: to find the rest of Voldemort's Horcruxes, items that make him immortal, and destroy them. The movie opens very bleakly, with the trio preparing for the grim journey, either forlornly watching the sunset, watching the Dursleys packing up and leaving for good, or wiping their parents' memories so that they'll never know if they never come back. Things quickly turn for the worse when Voldemort takes over the Ministry of Magic and wraps his fist around every aspect of the lives of England's Wizarding folk.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that'll keep you in your seat. What impressed me the most about it was its loyalty to the book. Because they split the movie into two parts, they were able to do the seventh book almost literally. There is nothing left out. It has the same feel as the book did, and I felt like I was reading it again.<br/><br/>The mood that this movie captured was that of oppression and fear. Voldemort attains more and more power in your mind as you watch, turning himself into this force of nature that the heroes only have the gloomiest hope of defeating. He's everywhere ‚Äì in the Death Eaters that fly openly across the sky, forcing the trio to hide; in the Snatchers that roam the woods looking for truants; in the radio stations that constantly broadcast the extensive lists of missing persons. The actors and the atmosphere the cinematography creates expertly throw the heavy mood of war on your shoulders.<br/><br/>Don't think that this movie is all gloom and doom, though. In every time I've seen it, there's out- loud laughter in the audience. It's all a strange mix. There's a convoluted heist; tense, epic battles; funny, awkward moments; spots that make you jump and a tear-jerking ending that leaves you groaning when the credits roll‚Äî not to mention an enormous cast of villains sporting propaganda, murder, coercion, and lies that make you want to break something."

The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.<br/><br/>What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone."

However, it's a necessary part of the journey (did I really just use the ""j"" word?) that Harry must take. <br/><br/>Interestingly there seems to a greater use of London as a location and the capture and impersonation of the three ministry workers adds to the greater connection with the muggle (I hate that invented term) world. The alienation of Ron for a central portion of the film works well both as a distancing device and to better bond him with Harry and Hermione for the final battle to come. There's a very cheesy section of Harry taking Excalibur from the lake ‚Äì sorry, I mean the sword of Gryffindor which again highlights how freely the series has borrowed from other sources.<br/><br/>This was the only film in the series where I felt I was missing something having not read the books.

","While the producers decided to cut the film based on the last Harry Potter novel into two parts as to maximize the revenue they could extract from the franchise, which has become the most lucrative film franchise of the last decades, the films that they made based on these two halves were quite good. They certainly weren't great films, unlike the Lord of the Rings, which was a truly great masterpiece of fantasy novel adapted into film. These Harry Potter films were competent but not masterpieces in any way shape of form. <br/><br/>There was also the problem of the main actors being a bit too old to portrait teenagers and thus it shows that they had to shave every half an hour and put some makeup over the shade of the beard."

I have found the HP franchise not good enough given the hype that surrounds them. That said I really quite enjoyed this first part of the final film - Daniel, Rupert and even Emma were so much better in this than the earlier films. The only other one I liked was The Order of the Phoenix even though it was about half an hour too long. The Deathly Hallows Pt 1 is a much more grown up movie and is the better for it. I would say it is even genuinely scary in parts. Daniel Radcliffe in particular is maturing as an actor and has had a difficult job carrying so many movies - if he had been no good then the whole thing would not have worked."
"hitchcockthelegend","6","1","3","17 July 2011"," The seventh installment, the appetiser.
","As the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the ""Horcruxes"" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.<br/><br/>So this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it's not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn't have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he's a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.<br/><br/>New additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it's still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!<br/><br/>Tension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10"

","I'm going to admit something off the bat, I've seen all the Harry Potter movies, but I've only seen them once and usually it's in the theater. The last Harry Potter film ended terrifically and I couldn't wait to see what the next installment was, to my surprise they decided to split the story into two parts: for story or money? I'm guessing more money vs. story, I mean come on, you know that Hollywood is bummed since these films are guaranteed money makers, and what a bad influence; it inspired Twilight to do so as well. Anyways I digress, since I've only seen each film only once and never read the books, I have to admit that I was confused throughout the film, thankfully I rented this one and watched it a couple of times, but to me, unless you're a die hard fan, this was the duller Harry Potter film I've seen of the bunch. This is basically the Harry Potter Project where the trio is just walking around the woods just trying not to get killed and learning how to survive. I know I will get hate points for that comment, but let's put it this way, I'm more looking forward to part 2 of the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>Lord Voldemort gains power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Meanwhile, the Order of the Phoenix arrive at Privet Drive and escort Harry to safety using potion to create six decoy Harrys. During their flight to the Burrow they are ambushed by Death Eaters, resulting in the deaths of Mad-Eye Moody and Hedwig. Voldemort attempts to kill Harry with Malfoy's wand, but fails. It's revealed that Harry was also willed to receive the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, however Scrimgeour states that the sword is an important historical artifact and is not eligible to be given away. Under the disguise of Polyjuice Potion, the trio infiltrate the Ministry and successfully retrieve the locket, escaping into the wilderness. But making Voldemort more determined to find the wand that will destroy Harry once and for all.<br/><br/>Now I don't want to bash the film, because it is very good, however I think I need to see all the films again before I see Part 2. I was lost during certain moments of the film because I've forgotten some of the information from the previous films. However, as usual the effects are fantastic and very fun to look at. The actors have grown so much and have such great chemistry that's carried on the past decade, it's great to see how far they've come. It's also sad to see what their characters had to give up as children and going into this world with such power and still not 100% sure on how to control it all. Not to mention who has the most power and who is in control of the group? Something I question though, because the series was more meant for children and granted the children who started the books are growing up but these stories have become a lot more darker. Not bad for the adults, but I think since kids IMO are a little more ""wussy"" now, they might not be able to handle this story, especially with the themes. But as a movie, it's good, but you definitely have to keep up with these stories, otherwise you will be very lost like me in the Harry Potter Woods.<br/><br/>7/10"

As it progresses and it comes to the end you realize that every expectation has fully delivered and maybe exceeded. Well, all i'm saying is that this movie has it all, comedy, action, adventure, drama, fantasy, suspense, mystery and even a bit romance. What else can the audience ask for?

","As the film progressed, the storyline got better. However, just like the last few Potter films, the beginning seems abrupt as if the viewer just jumped into the middle of a scene without proper introduction. Granted, I have not read any of the novels with the exception of the first, however, I shouldn't have to have read the books to have a clear beginning, should I? My main complaint about the Harry Potter films in general is the lack of good character development of the emotions between Harry and Hermoine. Each of the characters seems disconnected from one another, particularly the three main ones. This is totally unacceptable. Characterization can make or break a film. The feelings the characters have toward one another must be depicted and fully explored. I realize I haven't addressed much about the plot but the editing, sound, and scene development are all superb. I look forward to the final installment. The franchise will be missed, indeed. One final comment: there are aspects of dialog not heard that are shown in closed captions. I highly recommend viewing this film with closed captions turned on. I don't know why this is so - that the dialog is missing yet visually shown."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 1, is the 7th film of the series, and I have to say it is the best one so far. All the sets, clothes, special effects and actors are great once again, and there was a little improvement on the script and on the direction, which makes this film a little less clumsy than the first six. Also, since they decided to split Deathly Hallows in two movies, that gives them plenty of time to tell the story, and they remain more faithful to the events of the book than ever.<br/><br/>However, that does not a good movie make. The events may be there, but the soul of the book is missing. There's none of the humor, suspense or drama that jump off the pages, and the only emotion the movie is able to induce is sleepiness. For anyone who hasn't read the books, the movie is incomprehensible and utterly boring. And for those who have, the only way to stay awake is remember how the scenes played when J.K Rowling wrote them, and not Steve Kloves. All those poignant moments ‚Äì Hedwig dying, the trio entering the Ministry, Ron leaving, everything that took place in Godrics Hollow, Ron coming back, the events on the Malfoy Manor, the death and burial of Dobby, everything ‚Äì are reduced to scenes that merely make you shrug or grimace.<br/><br/>It's too bad J.K. Rowling didn't wait a few years before she let Warner Brothers adapt her books. That way, maybe the director and screenwriter could have been actual fans, people with a real understanding of the series who would be able to capture the atmosphere of the source material. I guess now we'll have to wait a few decades for the remake."

Not the trio hanging out in forests and scenic locations.!! Nope..'prisoner of azkaban' still remains my favorite... I speculate a better part 2 though.!! As to conclude and to add a few more lines, for the site won't let my review be less than ten linesXD..6 stars for the movie..it would have been more if harry made his eyebrows a bit thin.."

","OK, so I probably shouldn't really be reviewing this, not being a Harry Potter fan. But I went to see it.<br/><br/>I went to see it on the word of a Harry Potter fan that this was a good film in its own right.<br/><br/>I beg to differ.<br/><br/>Harry Potter fans may well be, and I think in the screening I was in were, sitting in slack-jawed adoration as lovable Harry Potter and his adorable chums meander around for 10 hours (well, that's what it felt like) gazing avidly at their navels.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the insane price tags of the actors, I would have thought this a very low-budget film as most of it consisted of the three of them dawdling around in woods or on hilltops, wondering what they ought to be doing.<br/><br/>Harry confessed to not having a plan. 'No, really?', I thought. 'Why not try meandering some more.""<br/><br/>There is some spectacle, but it was entirely meaningless to me as a humble muggle-hugger, but I'm sure it will be good for the fans.<br/><br/>I'm assured that it is quite faithful to the book which also meandered and, if you enjoyed the book, you will probably enjoy the film.<br/><br/>That said. I may return for the sequel to make sure that Helena Bonham- Carter gets her comeuppance. B!*ch!"
"npark009","6","1","3","27 November 2010"," Did not live up to the hype!
","I loved all the books and all the movies. But I believe I speak for many when I say that JK Rowling's work was always better than David Yates'. Although these two cannot be fairly compared, all the movies were still enjoyable to watch as it offered a clear visual of the majestic wizarding school and the beautiful Hermione granger. But this one did not cut it, AT ALL.<br/><br/>I was glad when I heard that the Deathly Hallows would be split into two parts because I assumed that meant more details and less cramming. Part 1 lacked explanation and an enormous amount of detail that made me stress throughout the movie. Here are some that I noticed:<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie did not talk about Dumbledore and his past with his brother at all even though the brother is a crucial factor at the end of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They NEVER used the invisibility cloak. it's part of the deathly hallows! I mean come on, its the title of the damn movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It did not explain why Harry's wand acted on it self when Harry was unconscious and attacked by Voldermort at the beginning of the movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>We were unable to see the inner thoughts of Harry after his wand had broke. We were shown one implication of displease when Harry said that it was fine and told Hermoine to get some rest. Harry's wand was such a big deal in the first movie, but easily overlooked when it broke in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After they end up in the wilderness, the movie begins to drag.</li></ul><br/><br/>The way they made this movie was done on purpose so that nothing really made sense and it would all come together in part II. The ultimate cliff hanger. <br/><br/>Although I agree with splitting the movie into two, I feel that this 2hr 30min movie could've been a lot more productive. Part II must have a recap of part I like the TV shows always do at the beginning of an episode because people will forget what exactly happened in part I and there will be mass confusion<br/><br/>With no doubt, part II will be extremely exciting with all the memorable/important scenes all in one movie, but in the end, Part I could've been much better."
"goddamit_iamwasted","5","1","3","22 November 2010"," harry potter only elves are shorter
","Starting off Daniel Radcliff is really short. I'm anti twilight and this franchise is going down the same path, coupled with the fact that Rowling went mills and boony on the last two books this movie is really disappointing. Its quite clich√©d with excruciatingly bad acting by Daniel Radcliff (December boys flashback) and Emma Watsons needs to go in for augmentation mammoplasty if she needs to hold at least fractional audience attention. <br/><br/>on the contrary, Rupert Grint was amazing seeing him last in the wild target with Nighy(who was wasted BTW) he bought Ron's nervous energy with the inherent darkness as mentioned in the book onto the screen with great talent though the poor guy had to leave mid way cause of the plot. Fiennes is just brilliant, his presence on the screen is all enveloping and you identify with the dread that the characters feel (and why they don't say his name) acutely. Voldemort is brought alive with great panache and brilliance. <br/><br/>there were some other performances of note such as David O'Hara was bemusing as the harry in the ministry, Umbridge felt vile and proper as always, Bellatrix was excellent, Weasly twins were mischievous bringing a smile to your face with just their presence and Evanna lynch was her loony self as Luna but on the other hand her father played by Ifans was terribly done and forced. <br/><br/>Suffice to say the young women in the potter universe leave a lot to be desired. Hermione is played with the same grotesque way I would associate with Bella in twilight. The fact that they both look and dress similar doesn't help matters much. Watson needs to come out of her shell and show whats she's truly capable of because there is a budding actress in her who needs to shine through soon or be relegated to be another flash in the pan story. Ginny Weasly is in one word ugly. True they didn't know when the cast her that she will become a future love interest but still for god sake get her some speech lessons at least. Of course she needed to come down to the kitchen to get her dress zipped because she's so inept. Poesy who plays Delacour is as flat chested and androgynous as the rest of them and one wonders why she is a French star at all because her acting is artificial to say the least. <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliff should jump off a cliff. Being the son of the casting agent can only get u only so far. U got to have talent and screen presence to go the distance. He is shorter than Emma Watson so come on. yes harry potter of the books is thin and sickly but cinematic interpretations demand a certain figure for the audience to not be disgusted with this pint of a fellow just bellowing on about how he is going to get Voldemort who's a truly colossal personality in the film. The funny thing is that u feel like siding with Voldemort in the films unlike the book just to shut Daniel up. Less said about his dialogue delivery the better. U feel he's trying to overcome a stutter and has been advised by a speech doctor to lisp and be expressionless while talking. <br/><br/>The special effects are basic with not much to write about except the Horcrux sequence. Every effort to save money on effects has been made. U see people come into frame only after the have apparated not once but multiple times. It's like watching a movie from the eighties where they switched to a shadow on the wall to show u what's happening. The story about the three brothers is completely animated, one can only assume to save production costs again though the animated sequence is brilliant and deserves full accolades. I was actually wishing that the movie was animated like that as well. Would've made for an excellent watch. <br/><br/>All in all it was the brilliant writing, albeit a little weepy, by Rowling which saved the day for this movie. her subplots, underlying concepts of good versus evil, subtle humour along with the mythology and pure magic of the books, pun intended, is what we are fans of. Unfortunately it is being murdered while being transferred onto the screen. This is how Ayn rand must have felt when fountainhead the movie came out. I wish they would take inspiration from the millennium series and come up with something actually worth audience's money instead of swindling them. You see poorly imagined sequences so that they barely bring alive what is written in the book. I want the illusion of inception, action of matrix and darkness of Schindlers list when I go to see these movies because the books are capable of that, clearly the director isn't."

There were very good points - as they followed the book , The visual effects , the acting and the Nagini close in was very terrifying!!! The locket scenes were well done and I literally cried at Debby's death.Radcliffe did a pretty decent role as did Grint and Emma.Just wanted that they should have shown the death of Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody. How could the have missed that!!!<br/><br/>Other than that everything was fine.I wanted to give it 9.5 but it being a potter movie I couldn't resist.

"rabiya-0606","Null","1","3","21 November 2010"," INCREDIBLE! This one is for the fans...
","Just returned after seeing the movie in IMAX and couldn't wait to add my own review. The movie is AMAZING people, it is very much like the book. All the actors have done a great job and the David Yates, man o man..!You brought my imagination to life..! I did not like the Order of the Phoenix ""very"" much. Half blood prince was good too but I dint find it very good either. I wasn't really happy that Yates is going to direct the last two but he has taken me by surprise. Rupert Grint portrayed the role to the tee. So did Daniel and Emma. Daniel was absolutely great in some scenes and Emma looked drop dead gorgeous. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was better in this movie than the previous installments and Dobby, u brought tears to me eyes. It had a lot of action and Nagini's scenes deserve a special mention for creeping me out ;) Starting with Hermione perform Obliviate, the seven Potters chase sequence(very funny then action packed), the wedding with the news ""They are coming""(Goose bump giving), the ministry sequence with Umbridge(Hilarious + pulse raisin), the camping sequences (scenic), the horcrux destruction(woooooh!), the tale of the three brothers (nicely portrayed by animation), the Malfoy Manor(thrilling), Dobby's death(tearful) and finally the end which makes u hungry for more. Go grab a ticket!!! The fans of the movies as well as the books are going to love the movie completely :)"
"austinlovestoact","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," Uh ....... nothing, it-it-it w-was just ......... TOTALLY AWESOME!
","WOW, what can I say . . . . lots of things! Just got back from Harry Potter and I am amazed. A lot of people think that making the 7th installment of the franchise into two parts was a bad idea but i highly disagree. A lot of the book elements were kept which i thought was cool. The only problem I had was I wanted to see more of the Dursleys in the beginning but none the less. People are always complaining that the movies take out important parts or parts that they love so when the directors and writers finally come up with a plan to fix this problem by making it a two parter, people don't agree. Being a reader of the books I though this was an excellent idea because it allowed for better pacing which really was good. My mom (who was not really knowledgeable about the Harry Potter world) said to me after that it was really good she got everything that was going on.<br/><br/>One thing that I loved was the darker tone of the movies (4-7) especcialy the one in this movie. (1-2) they had more child like and campy feel to them but kinda from (3-7) the movies took on more darker tones which I loved.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film also allowed many great dialouge scenes with the actors and actresses. It really showed off their acting skills. They also all looked really good. Hermione was awesome and she has really blossomed, Ron was great and i liked the way he was used kind of like the comic relief, and Harry was spectacular. In contrast to the great dialouge scenes, we also get great action sequences, yes they were short and yes there were parts where i hoped there would be a battle but there wasn't but the 7 Harry chase scene was awesome and the Snake in Godric's Hallow scared the crap out of me but was awesome. But i think my favorite sequences were the polyjuice potion scenes ( the 7 harry's) but most of all the one between Harry, Ron and Hermione in the Ministry of Magic with Dorlores Umbridge and the Dementors which was funny and cool. Also towards the end with Dobby ( my favorite part of the whole/character movie) When he lets loose the chandelier and it almost hits Belletrix and he says ""Dobby never meant to kill. Dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure."" That was great. The deaths in the movie like Hedwigs, and Mad Eye Moody's but most of all Dobby's ( I'll admit were heartbreaking) were sad. Dobby was my favorite character in the whole franchise. It was sad to see him in the body bag when they buried him and his last words were touching. Dobby, R.I.P. good buddy. Overall there were a couple things missing from the book but nothing to moan and bitch about. It was a great movie and I cannot wait until the last one comes out but i will also be sad because I grew up with this franchise it seems 2010-2011 will be the end of great movie franchises i will miss (Toy Story, Harry Potter etc.)I remember going with my parents on my birthday to see the 1st harry potter movie. It is something I grew up with and i love. It was a great movie and It will be remembered for ages.<br/><br/>""Dobby has no master!""<br/><br/>-Dobby<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"
"rbangert","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," You won't be disappointed...
","I highly recommend this movie. If you've seen the prior installments of the series, you're in for a real treat--this is the best of the lot. The acting is superb, the pacing just right, the cinematography beautiful and dramatic, the settings gorgeous. As always, one can't expect the movie to slavishly follow the book; sticklers for details and favorite scenes may be disappointed. But the essence of the story in character development, in tone, and in the great themes of the series are all captured quite well.<br/><br/>Exciting, engaging, somber and humorous, well done! And someone in our group had not read the stories and seen only one of the prior movies and followed along quite well... Highly recommended for older children, teens, and adults who have kept their imaginations alive."
"dude1234561234","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," Excellent, breath-taking, exhilarating, mind-blowing, magnificent, and best of all EPIC
","After waiting for so long, I definitely would agree that this movie has lived up to its hype being probably the best movie of the entire series. I loved each and every single part of it. Nobody could hate this movie for not following the book. It follows almost everything! There are some small scenes here and there for example the Hedwig flying rather than stuck in a cage and dying. But those things don't make much a difference to the overall quality of this film.<br/><br/>It totally sticks to the book! This book was probably the closest interpretation of a Harry Potter book yet. The effects were stunning and the sound tracks were ... well epic. All in all, I wouldn't have had any problem watching the entire film all at once.. (as long as they had some intermission time of course). <br/><br/>This movie was indeed one of my favorites and will most definitely break records in the box-office world. It is a must see film for both hardcore Harry Potter fans and the naive Muggles."
"serdarv","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," Absolutely fantastic!
","After HP6, I was beginning to worry that the HP films would turn into another example where we see the motion picture doesn't match well with the novel. I must admit that I am revealed after seeing this installment. The film was very well made and inline with the book. The emphasis given to different events is distributed in a good balance. You see a very good mixture of fear, confusion, and that slightest hope that the characters always keep with them. The psychology of every scene is wonderfully executed. I felt like I am also going through this journey with the characters on the screen. The division of the book into two films was a great idea and where it is split into two is perfectly chosen. You want to see more but you also feel like ""yes, part one is over, let's see the rest next year"". Congratulations to everyone in the cast."
"NolanFincherBoyle","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," ""Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" proves that the end isn't necessarily a bad thing
","We have all had Harry Potter in our lives. We've either read all the books or seen all the movies multiple times. Almost all of us, from the elementary school all the way up until the later years of high school, have been influenced by J.K Rowling's masterpiece that has grabbed millions of fans all over the world into a world full of magic, peril, friendship, loss, and hope. <br/><br/>Now I know many think the Harry Potter movies, although good as they most likely are as films, don't reach the same emotional and magical level the books do. And to those people: you are right. However, from my own perspective, film adaptations with a movie and a book or source material can't be graded as the same thing. I see an adaptation as not only being faithful to the material, but carrying on its own with the same tone, emotion, and feeling the source material did. For me, the Potter films have done this. No, the films haven't included every single line or scene the fans want, but as films, they work extremely well with having the same themes throughout all the films thus far. <br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is the second-to-last installment in the Harry Potter franchise. For those who didn't know, the last book was split into two parts for two sakes: more money, and being extremely faithful in ending the series on an epic and satisfying conclusion for all fans. To me, this film had to go all out with the acting, plot, and an overall feeling of closure with now over 10 years in the making. <br/><br/>And did this film do just that? Oh yes, and it even exceeded my expectations in not only being extremely faithful (maybe TOO faithful) but working as a film on its own. From just the opening scene until the credits role, I was also taken back by how epic this film was. Brethless, I sat through the credits with one particular flaw: that we would have to wait eight months for the final installment to come out.<br/><br/>Getting right to that acting, the trio has their all time best here. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry relies mostly on the act of silence to convince everyone that Harry is, once again, alone and desperate. His first shot proves this well the most, as someone who has lost almost everything while trying to keep hold of what he has left. However, this isn't Radcliffe's film. It belongs to his two companions, Ron and Hermione, instead. Grint, far away from his comedic side now steps into a more dramatic role and does it perfectly. And Watson nearly steals the entire movie from everyone with some of the most heartbreaking moments from the series so far. Even from the acting, something that has bogged down the Potter series from being taken seriously by most critics, this film shows them up. <br/><br/>Even from the adult cast, it hits a ever higher standers from ANY Potter film in the past. Fiennes, Carter, Rickman, Isaacs, Felton, Gleeson, Thewlis, and Straunton are all perfect. New additions including Bill Nighy Rhys Ifans as gives top performances to enhance the world as a time of hopelessness and darkness. <br/><br/>As from the technical side of the film, it is nearly flawless. The special effects are at a all time high in the series: nothing feels fake or to showy in order to win the audience over. Eduardo Serra's cinematography enhances the three characters into the most desolate landscapes all across England, and with great camera movements from subtle moments to intense action scenes, it's possibly the best of the entire series. Alexandre' Desplat score gives something that, for me, no Potter film has ever produced: balance. His score never feels over the top neither lacking in any sense. It is epic when it needs to be epic, sad when it needs to be sad, and beautiful in the more dire moments. And finally: no credit can be hidden from production designer Stuart Craig, who gives the best sets for all the movies thus far. And here: he tops them with familiar and creepy atmospheres through all the film. <br/><br/>David Yates captures the emotion and feeling from the book perfectly and upon that, sets the standard higher than any HP director before him with two amazing and unique scenes: one being a animated sequence that is breathtaking to view telling the more important information to our heroes, and then a dance scene set to Nick Cave's ""O'Children"" that will indefinitely divide the HP fan base. One side, including myself, call it perfect to sum up the relationship as brother and sister, but in a time of depression and desperation, people can see the good in little things. Like Dumbledore said: ""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.""And for Hermione, Harry was her light. Not at being romantic, but through love of being best friends. And in that, it worked perfectly. <br/><br/>Harry Potter is something that will remain with me for the rest of my life. I loved all the books growing up as a child in middle school, and even though it makes me sad the movies are coming to an end after 10 years of magical moments, we still have something to hold onto for the meantime. ""Deathly Hallows"" is a monumental achievement of visual wonder, acting calibers of all sides from the younger cast to the veterans of the series. It's extremely faithful for even the more die-hard fans, and if not enjoyed by them, I seriously feel sorry for them. Even through the camping scenes, I was moved. This is a Potter film that we've never seen before, but in the end, it is by far the best. So please: go see the best HP film to date."
"prasharry2k2","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," The best out of the lot
","First of all the movie was the most awesome of the big novels. I mean the director always has to change screenplay for big novels because of their sheer size. The Potter fans who only watch the movies and never read the novels will find every movie awesome but for the ones who read the novels and come to watch the movies, they will always be a tad bit disappointed. This one was not that. David Yates had the tough task of making a movie out of a book which for us fans holds a special place in heart. He did a great job of it and hope something good from the second movies as well. There are one or two disappointments but overall very spine chilling and enjoyable especially the dangerous scene where Hermione is left to fend off against a group of pure blood supremacists. The scene where Dobby dies was as emotional in the movie as in real life, but the burial was a bit incomplete. The actors have grown in stature as their characters too. Emma Watson did very well in her emotional scenes and the guys were good too. For me the best movie out of the lot. Waiting for the DVD's to come out now.<br/><br/>The only thing that remains to be seen is how the second part turns up."
"imbrunitoh","8","1","3","20 November 2010"," The HP movie that completely exceeded my expectations.
","I must be completely hones with you guys: when I saw this movie announced in the ""Opening this week"" box, I was not really touched, even tho I'm a HP fan. I disagree with most of the positive reviews from the third movie onwards, the actions, plot and history in those films were changed in a negative wave, resulting in a personal disappointment. They were not bad but something was clearly missing... <br/><br/>However after reading several positive reviews from this movie, a movie from my favorite book from the series, I gave it a chance... and this time, I was not disappointed: David Yates does his very best in this dark thriller with the help of some outstanding performances from Watson(Hermione), Radcliffe(Harry), Fiennes(Voldemort) and Carter(Bellatrix).<br/><br/>The movie develops slowly thanks from being divided in 2 parts, something that the prequels could have used (specially HP6). You enter in a cold adult world, where all character are a lot more serious. The dark mood of this film catchs you right from the start.<br/><br/>I think that most of the changes and cuts from the book here were really smart, plus dialogs are well executed. Something that will really blow you(r eyes) will be the effects... they are stunning. The definition and effort put in every single graphic is visible, I will learn the names from the special effects team, they did an awesome work.<br/><br/>Also, I will point that Yates can make some really emotional scenes, like Dumbledore's last scene in HP6, the last scene of this film touches you deep in your heart.<br/><br/>In the end, we really can't judge this movie as a one, we must see his sequel. The changes Yates made as Wormtails surviving may affect the following picture... a picture I will wait very excited."
"sophianinam","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," The Beginning Of The End
","""These are dark times, there is no denying.""<br/><br/>The sentence sets of the mood and everyone prepares for the journey.<br/><br/>The beginning may feel a bit rushed up but it was well achieved. I think it prepares us to accept that this time will be different. Harry remembers when he slept under the stairs and it brought so many memories from the first film. Reason why I loved the movie from the very start. The way Hedwig dies is somewhat different from what it is described in the book but it was changed in a pleasant way from my perspective. She is killed by a Deatheater, yes, but protecting Harry while flying instead of dying while inside the cage. It was very touching and that moment made the button of emotion of the film get turned on. I almost burst into tears right there and it wasn't the only moment. This also prepares us for the many losses Harry suffers through the film, intensifying the sacrifice, courage, friendship and all the values that surround the Harry Potter world.<br/><br/>Another moment of the film I would like to highlight is after Ron's departure. Harry and Hermione aren't in the best mood and suddenly Harry invites Hermione to a dance. I almost cried here as well. Their complicity was astonishing and it helped to lighten the dark feeling of loss and despair. I noticed how everyone started to laugh and made like ""awww"" in the cinema when Harry started to wave Hermione's hands with this tilted smile emerging on his face. Outstanding!<br/><br/>There were many more of this moments and I wish I could describe them all but I wouldn't stop writing till tomorrow morning. This film is very more mature, more focused on friendship and how to survive through hard times. Daniel, Emma and Rupert did an amazing job portraying the characters, as well as the rest of actors, and they exceed their capacities on this one. Also, little old Dobby appears (aswell as Kreacher) and the special effects were magnificent since the spells to the animated sequence of The Tale Of The Three Brothers. It was amazing.<br/><br/>The slow pace is very well achieved, never dragging, very real, allowing to explain the details behind the story to those who didn't read the books and a pleasure to those who read them as in my case. The soundtrack is awesome as always and they were very daring which made me love the movie even more. Towards the end of film when Harry, Hermione and Ron are chased by Snatchers is incredibly awesome not because of the music, but for the lack of it! They Apparate and suddenly everybody holds his breath in the room. The three friends are face to face with Snatchers. Whoops! They decide to run and the music ceases. The work of the sound effects was marvelous, building the tension. Incredible!<br/><br/>I only regret they didn't show the scene where Harry finds the photograph and Lilly's letter on Sirius' room at Grimauld place. Thought it would be a very touching sequence but unfortunately they didn't put it in. Anyway, they definitely compensated with other details. Loved when they went to Godric's Hollow and they didn't take Polyjuice Potion. Harry said ""I don't want to come here pretending to be someone else."" I agreed and wasn't at all mad for this change they made. I was a bit apprehensive to how they were going to end this first part. Didn't want it to be abrupt causing me to get really angry because I wanted more but no, it was an amazingly-placed and well put together cliffhanger. Congrats on this!<br/><br/>I'm a true Harry Potter fan. Read all the books, accompanied all the films and the growth of the characters. This film (at least the first half) is fantastic indeed. Loved the previous films but this one is of course special and I had great expectations as it was even going to be split into two. Honestly, it even exceeded my expectations. There are no words to describe it.<br/><br/>I grew up with Harry Potter and I'm surely going to burst into tears when I leave the theater in 2011 after watching the second part. It's a shame all good things come to an end.<br/><br/>To finish, loved everything and congratulations to everyone that worked in the film. I highly recommend watching it whether you're a Potter fan or not. It definitely deserves it and I'm sure going to see it again if the opportunity arises!"
"sanddragon939","10","1","3","20 November 2010"," The Brilliant Beginning of the Epic End...
","Three years ago, the world held its collective breath as it flipped through the pages of the the final installment of JK Rowling's epic 7-part series, seeking the satiation for a curiosity that had all but consumed them absolutely for years-who would live? who would die? and what would become of the survivors? Thousands of theories and counter-theories later, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows revealed the answers at long last (some of which had already been predicted); but it wasn't just the resolution of sub-plots and character arcs and the solving of long-standing magical mysteries that gripped the reader, but above all the sheer epic scale and scope of this saga within a saga that spanned virtually the entirety of the fantastic realm spawned by Rowling. Needless to say, while the novel positively GLOWED with cinematic potential, adapting an epic such as this does present unprecedented challenges...even more so when one takes into account the Harry Potter film series predilection for liberally eliminating significant plot elements from the novels in hopes of condensing the stories for accommodation in a 2-3 hour time span. Now, the same clearly couldn't be done with the Deathly Hallows-the minutest elements were of paramount importance to the overall plot and couldn't be safely done away with without running the risk of completely butchering Rowling's story. To this end, the film-makers wisely decided to split the book into two films...And after a long wait Part I is finally here and it certainly surpasses expectations (then again, it is pretty much EXPECTED that an HP film WILL 'surpass expectations'...) The very first aspect of this film that strikes you is that it sends a message. A very strong message that the wizarding world has changed-for the worse. The trademark WB logo we see at the start of the film is shown to be rusting...in stark contrast to the glowing WB of old; much like the circumstances of the characters have taken a turn for the worst. Death Eaters are perpetually swirling about in the skies, waiting to attack members of the Order of the Pheonix when the slightest opportunity presents itself...Voldemort has taken control of the Ministry, using its official authority and power to hunt down dissidents to his fascist regime of pure-blood supremacy...and Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced out of the sanctuary of their homes, on the run in the wilderness, with barely a clue as to how they are to accomplish the crucial task their deceased mentor Albus Dumbledore left them-finding and destroying the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) that anchor the Dark Lord to life.<br/><br/>Understandably, this film boasts not only of a darker tone but a radically different direction from its predecessors-no longer are the legendary trio of teenage wizards students...they are now fugitives from the 'evil empire', soldiers in a war they are ever so close to losing. Freed from the confines of Hogwarts, director David Yates seizes the opportunity to place the protagonists against the backdrop of a number of breathtaking scenic locations and in a number of situations (expertly crafted by Rowling) which provide a wealth of variety as opposed to the schoolyard atmosphere of previous installments-at one point we see Harry, Ron and Hermione on a Mission Impossible-style mission-breaking into the Ministry of Magic in order to steal a locket that might just be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes; later we catch them in an intensely blink-and-you-miss-it fast-paced chase through a forest; to say nothing of the chaotic duel in the claustrophobic confines Malfoy Manor towards the end. Truly, the action scenes are a class apart but another area where this film shines is character development-from being the boy wizard perpetually looking to Dumbledore for guidance, Harry is now the man calling the shots in this perilous quest to destroy Voldemort; and even his trusted 'sidekicks' Ron and Hermione are beginning to question their participation in his mission. Ron's violent emotional outburst in the middle of the film, Hermione's despair and wistfulness for a simpler past and Harry's eternal self-doubt and frustration leave as indelible an imprint on the viewer's mind as much as any of the magnificent displays of magic (courtesy of some truly revolutionary SFX) does-Ron near mental-breakdown after being psychologically tortured by a fragment of Voldemort's soul is the most emotionally powerful sequence in the film, as is the Harry-Hermione 'dance scene', a rare moment of light-heartedness in an otherwise grim story which exemplifies in many ways the deep love the two characters share, even in the absence of any romantic involvement.<br/><br/>If there is one shortcoming in this film, it is that scarcely enough focus is given to the titular 'Deathly Hallows' in the film (save for a truly fantastic animation sequence explaining the legend behind them) as opposed to the novel-though no doubt they will be addressed in Part II given the crucial part they are to play at the end of the story. Dumbledore's backstory with the Dark wizard Gellert Grindlewald, the discovery of which has a debilitating impact on Harry's morale in the book, is likewise also sidelined, though perhaps that can be forgiven, given the time constraints.<br/><br/>Despite these minor issues, the film does end up pretty well, which is to say, it ends badly for our characters who, having barely escaped with their lives (for what may well be the umpteenth time) watch one of their oldest friends die-to say nothing of Voldemort having reached the very pinnacle of his magical power in the very last scene...well, as those who have read the book know, things are only going to get worse before they even start remotely looking better for our heroes and undoubtedly Part I has left the audiences restless for the next (and final) installment that chronicles the (inevitable) triumph of good over evil in the wizarding world."

","This movie was fantastic, from the second that Warner Brothers logo went by you knew this film was different from the others.

But I took some friends with me that didn't read the books, and for the most part didn't watch the movies.

","I have saw all of the harry potter films and read all of the books so I'm a huge fan and must say this was the most faithful to the book by far. You know from the start of the movie that this will not be like the other movies before it. It's starts off very dark with the minister of magic making a speech. The film is really emotional this time around a lot of characters die. For example Dolby the house elf dies and it's really sad to see him die the way he does I almost had tears in my eyes. And if you do not like snakes then do not see this there are two major scenes that involve a snake the first one is at the start of the film and this scene is rather creepy and disturbing. The second scene has a jump scene so if your scared of snakes then don't go. The movie has a little bit of blood in it. If you liked the series from the start then you will love this one if not then this will not really change your mind. Now I cannot wait for the second film."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a 2010/2011 two-part epic fantasy film directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. The film is produced by Rowling along with David Heyman and David Barron. The two parts form the seventh and final installment in the Harry Potter film series, with the story following Harry Potter on a quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to immortality ‚Äì the Horcruxes. The films star Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

"RCWjr","9","1","3","19 November 2010"," A fine start to the end
","I have only read one book in the series, which is Deathly Hallows. I have been a fan of all 6 previous films solely based on the films themselves. Having read Deathly Hallows I came into this film with a little nagging concern. Would I be like some who are readers of the books and have felt the films removed way too much? Or would I continue to be content with the story and enjoy it the same? The answer is a resounding I loved this! Having read the book previous actually helped me to enjoy this film even more.<br/><br/>This is by far my favorite film to date. I was worried how Kloves would handle the tremendous amount of exposition that comes with this book. I need not have worried as there are elements which are downplayed considerably; most notably Harry's growing doubt of Dumbledore (this is only hinted at), his farewell to the Dursley's and the efforts on the home-front, mainly the Lovegood updates from the home-front. The camping scenes, as they have come to be known, are handled expertly and it is these segments that are some of the most enjoyable.<br/><br/>There are some embellishments here and there, all work well, especially a dancing segment during the camping montage. There are no surprise deaths, fans will be relived to know the deaths from the book have not been softened or changed.<br/><br/>Cinematography,music, SFX's, all are some of the best to date. The acting too is fantastic. I had read many a review previous to seeing the film that highlighted Grint's turn as Ron this go around as being the stand out. I have to agree he is the best he has ever been. But to me, Emma Watson is the diamond here. She has probably matured the most of the three leads, funny that she is the one who really isn't set on continuing to act after all the Potter films have come out.<br/><br/>One of the best films I have seen this year, it whets the appetite and has me anxious for the finale in July."
"bandgeekweirdo","10","1","3","19 November 2010"," Followed the book!
","I liked this Harry Potter movie a lot for one basic fact. It followed most of the book! Most of the movies cut out things in the books that ""weren't important"" or didn't pertain to the plot. I liked this one because they took the time to look at the book. The reason they made the two movies is to satisfy those people who always complain about how the movies don't include everything in the book. I read other reviews were they say it was boring. Well it is what happens in the book. The beginning of the book is basically them moving through the woods looking for horcruxes hence why this movie is mainly in the woods. I liked that it drew out this part because it let the characters of Ron Harry and Hermione develop more. The only thing that I didn't like was how they didn't make Remus as big a focus as he is in the book. He is the last connection to Harry's father and I felt like they should have made him and Tonks bigger players in this movie. However other than that I really did enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see the next one, which will be full of wizard dueling and the final last moments of Harry Potter."

"paperback_wizard","8","1","3","19 November 2010"," Not A Children's Story
","Earlier this week, I reread ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" to refresh my memory before seeing the movie. A woman who sat next to me in the bookstore caf√© asked a few questions about the book, noting, among other things, what a remarkable phenomenon the series had become. I offered my opinion that the author, J.K. Rowling, could hardly have predicted the immense success of her creation; that, when she started writing, her only objective was to write a children's story, and that is how you must always view the books, no matter how dark they become. However, the movies are certainly not bound by that.<br/><br/>At its heart, the Harry Potter books are and will always be children's books. The characters, unlike the fully-fleshed out characters in more ""adult"" series, tend to be more elemental. I wouldn't call them two-dimensional, but every character represents something in the series. Voldemort is the purest evil, while Ron and Hermione are Harry's loyal companions. Harry, of course, is our fearless hero, and Dumbledore is the ever-present mentor and guardian. That is, until we reach Book Seven. Everything about Harry's life and beliefs is challenged in this chapter of the series. His relationship with Dumbledore, who died at the end of Book Six and can no longer guide or protect him, is brought into question as new information about the old wizard's life surfaces after his death. As Harry seeks the means to destroy Voldemort, he becomes increasingly aware that Dumbledore left him with precious fews clues on how to do so.<br/><br/>At his side, of course, are Ron and Hermione who refuse to let him travel alone when half the wizarding world is looking for him, for one reason or another. After six years of friendship and shared danger, their trust in Harry hardly needs explanation. However, as the enormity of the task becomes ever more clear to them, dissension eats away at that trust, and the fact that they're all merely teenagers, albeit magicians, makes the mission that much more difficult. So much has been sacrificed on everyone's part, including family, that Harry is reluctant to ask or even accept any more sacrifices; and yet, even more will be required of all of them before the tale is complete.<br/><br/>I've always preferred the movies to the books. As compelling as Rowling's writing is, it is still intended primarily for children, and it shows. I don't mean that in a derogatory way; but elemental characters such as the brainy Hermione, the bumbling Hagrid, and the loony Luna need more to make them truly enjoyable. At times, they do break out of their ""roles"", and that is when they truly shine. Rowling does her best to give the readers a window into the characters' souls, to feel the weight of the burdens they carry. She certainly pulls no punches with Harry, barely allowing him a moment of triumph or celebration before adding another tragedy or burden to his lot.<br/><br/>The movies, on the other hand, add a bit more realism to the struggle. It's not just the ""picture says a thousand words"" element. It's the little touches, the slight changes in dialogue from page to screen, that make the characters less elemental and more human. The pruning of a scene or editing of exposition here and there eases the rhythm and allows the viewer to go with the flow. The soundtrack itself does a fantastic job of bringing the story to life (keep your ears open for Nick Cave's ""O Children"", which adds a particular bittersweetness to one compelling scene).<br/><br/>There is so much that changes in this seventh installment that, after a few early scenes have ended, you can hardly recognize the series. There are familiar faces, of course, and the main element remains: the fact that Harry Potter must defeat Lord Voldemort himself or die trying. This is only the first part of Book Seven, of course; the second half will wait until next summer. Expect everything to change again.<br/><br/>(Originally appeared as ""Not A Children's Story"" at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2010/11/not-a-childrens-story/ )"
"BRJPinkston","8","1","3","19 November 2010"," Couldn't describe how well the movie transcribed the book
","To say the least, David Yates and his staff have nearly perfected the art of filmography transcription. Although every nook and cranny could not be filled as with a book, the motion picture does an excellent job of capturing the fear, angst, passion, and depression that are so very easily displayed in the novel. The Actors have all matured wonderfully and it really shows that they are trying to earn their way legitimately as actors in the world. No longer able to ride the role of a child or adolescent, the 3 are sent off on their own as adults, completely responsible and alone. The film captured each character's... character really quite well. What we witnessed in the theater were by what seemed by all senses, real emotion. There is little more a director, producer, actor, and most importantly a fan could ask for. Thankyou David Yates, can't wait for part 2"

","I really enjoyed this movie, I was a little confused because this was the first Harry Potter movie I've seen. My brother has read the books and I think I'll have to do that now. I didn't understand who the guy with the weird face with slits for a nose was. Also the magic seemed a little far fetched but it's a movie so I'll bite. Why did he have that thing on his forehead and who was Voldemort? I didn't really understand what the muggle was looking for and why he was banned from the underground place with the statues. Finally, what was Doby, was he like a kid or something, and if so why can he talk so well or did he have a defect that made him short. That was the only far fetched part of the movie, except for the magic, but I liked it. I hope they make another one."
"Fields201","10","1","3","19 November 2010"," Harry Potter and the Series That Just Shouldn't End
","Seriously, I'm glad that the second part to this is a few months away because I'd hate to see this series end. As the film reflects back to previous events in the earlier installments, I myself reflected back at where I was in my life during each movie. The very first installment, I was practically fresh out of high school. And now here I am, witnessing the first part of the final installment. I've come a long way.<br/><br/>Those who have read the book would know that Deathly Hallows follows it quite well. There are subtle differences, but none that would distract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Therefore, if you are one of those people who were disappointed at how butchered the previous movies were to the books, then you shouldn't have a problem with this one. <br/><br/>To those who don't know, this film is about Harry, Ron, and Hermoine setting out to find the horcruxes that must be destroyed in order to defeat Voldemort. They don't really know where the horcruxes are, or how to destroy them. Meanwhile, Voldemort's minions are searching for them and the people that they care about are in mortal danger.<br/><br/>The reason why I consider this one being the best one so far (although I really loved the first Harry Potter) is its brisk pace. In previous installments, there always seem to be this lag time. These lag times usually entail something being introduced to the characters that is vital to later in the film. This resulted in slowing the films' pace. It didn't really happen here. There were some slow parts, but something would pick up the speed and usually kept the audience laughing. There's a scene where Harry and Hermoine were distraught, and Harry danced with her like an idiot. It helped lighten the mood and also brought interest to the scene.<br/><br/>There's a lot of action in this one, and the performances were unbelievable. I heard a lot of praise for Helena Bonham Carter as Belatrix. She did a wonderful job and a lot creepier this time around. The three leads: Harry, Ron and Hermoine all did a superb acting job this time around because their chemistry was on the mark. Also, there's an animation sequence in the film, which, at first, I thought was out of place because never had there been an animation sequence in a Harry Potter film before. It was awesome. <br/><br/>I also welcome back Doby. What took him so long to come back?<br/><br/>The only negative thing I could say about it and it's very minor is how the film ended. It just left you wanting more. But it is the first part and we would just have to wait on what will happen in the conclusion on the second part.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling is probably writing a new Harry Potter as we speak."

So let's start with the plot. I mean the screenplay because we all know that the book is as awesome as hell. The screenplay is ... well not so good. I mean it's not bad either but it could of been so much better. They deleted scenes which would take couple of minutes but would add so much. And there's nothing bad about a long movie(yeah we all remember LOTR don't we?). So yeah that's that also they for some unknown reason change some lines. Like when Ron gets all angry and is about to go he says ""I sow you to the other night"" wheres in the book he said ""I got it you choose him"". I mean JK knew what she was doing and her lines would always be better than those of the dude who rote screenplay. OK, now that we're over with that - effects, yes of cause special. I've got to admit - there pretty cool. Of cause it's no Dark Knight nor Inception though it's understandable since Nolan wasn't around (dan it). Acting. It was pretty good.

Along with Hermione Granger and and Ronald Weasly, the three friends began this adventure at Hogwarts, and what started out as a silly romp through magical inanity has turned in to something very dark. Although Hogwarts is not where this story takes place, it is still part of the ongoing story. As with Lord of the Rings, the story has taken on proportions that Author J.K. Rowling probably had no control over - This story is telling itself and under the superb direction of David Yates, who has been at the helm for the last few Potter films, has been brought to vivid life. Magic and Technology clash in the middle of London in the sight of all of the unsuspecting Muggles.<br/><br/>Each Potter film has been subsequently better then the previous films, and this film hits the peak... all stops are pulled out, nothing is held back...

Catastrophe has been reached, we await the EuCatastrophe.<br/><br/>We know that Potter has been accumulating useful magical objects during his education at Hogwarts, and in this film he uses most of them. Also, look for the very first Magic-Gadget used by Dumbledore in the first Potter movie. Now we are in a race to find the objects that make up the Deathly Hallows - We know who has one of these objects, it has been used in previous Potter films. It is not used in this one. And now we know ""You-Know-Who"" is searching for these same objects. Who will get them first? Many questions which have been unanswered through the entire series are now being revealed, some questions we did not know were being asked. The doorway that Serious Black fell through as he died, what was that, where does it lead? These loose ends are just beginning to be tied up and I look very forward to the final installment of the Potter series - Will these things be explained, or will Harry have to explore more and more nightmarish scenarios?

It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. The acting was fantastic. The trio plays their characters exceptionally well. Emma and Rupert was outstanding in my opinion. As for Daniel, well lets just say, those two has outshines him this time around. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was a very standout character, Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour certainly look like a lion, Helena's Bellatrix was menacing and torturous as ever, Snape was being himself like he always is, Lucius and Narcissa also plays their supporting role well (I love it when Narcissa shivers as Dobby was making his speech).

Now if they wanted to do that then why split two parts for the last movie when you could of left it to just one or add in some parts you missed out from the Half-Blood Prince to clarify things. It's all about milking money from the franchise.<br/><br/>So if you watch this movie its more of a romance between Ron and Hermione, lots of camping, forests and lots of dialogue saying ""who'd, what and where"". The ending is pathetic with Dobby the house elf dead. For a movie that's only based on a few pages and not even half way through, how many years do we have to wait when it's finished because its getting frustrating."
"nickblommaert","10","1","4","28 November 2010"," Harry Potter, the evolution
","I remember when I saw the first movie , I was about the same age as Harry was back then. I had read the book first and I was sold immediately, so I wanted to go see the movie as soon as possible. Ever since I have watched Harry Potter grow and evolve. The movies got better, more mature , more intriguing but also darker,just as the books did . The Deathly Hollows is simply the perfect finale to a legendary franchise. Just like any Harry Potter fan I was afraid that the movie would not do just to the book but I couldn't be more wrong. The movie is brilliant , it has everything it needs to be a good movie but without being your typical blockbuster . It gives the viewers what they want and it gives the readers what they want. It has thrill, action and suspense. It's grim but not to grim, it's dark but not to dark. It's exactly like everything I pictured in my mind from reading the book , the scenery, the atmosphere ,the emotion ... It's certainly the best movie from the franchise , so far . I'm confident that Part II will be a worthy successor and it will blow everyone away."

","Well tonight I went to see the midnight premier of HP7 (I live in Hungary)and I just got home. I waited so long for this movie... I wanted to have an expression of a HP movie without reading the book... So I bought the book on the day of release but never had read it (till know). OK maybe less is left out from the book but I found myself looking at my watch and asking ""come on when is this gonna end?"". A few hours ago i was hyper-excited about this movie, but after seeing it I felt ""well, not a bad movie bet not a good one either"" So this is just my own opinion but as a viewer who does not know the story I felt bored an it was way too slow. Also I'm about to read the book and I'm planning to see the movie again afterwards, so if i have the opportunity I'll write another review from the perspective of a reader."
"arashf4","8","1","4","23 November 2010"," What a complete waste of my time.
","Let me put it this way. THIS FILM WAS TERRIBLE! I can not believe that I gave up going to a party to go to a midnight screening of this piece of crap. It was horrifically boring. Most of the film was mellow and pointless. I thought this film would be good for the 8.3 on this website. But apparently, those idiots do not have a good taste of movies. If it was a 2 hour film of Harry, Ron, and Hermione taking a dump it would be more entertaining than this crap! It also had a terrible ending with no warning. In conclusion, this movie did had some good action and some funny moments, but if you were to choose between this and a party, I would choose the party because the director made 3 crappy films in a row, and although this was better than the crappy 5th and 6th films, it was still on my ""waste of my time"" list. I certainly hope that they won't screw up part 2, because if those kids are getting millions of dollars for this crap, then someone's gonna get sued."

A shame that so much time was wasted on here say situations that made the audience around me start yawning with boredom. i mean it had some humorous and heart rending situations as well as some very dark disturbing ones which made this a movie IMO not suited for kids under 14 but it strayed into the this movie is getting long in the tooth and boring area. let's hope the 2nd part picks up the pace and is better,"
"rahulbaskaran","8","1","4","20 November 2010"," Perfectly Set-up for the Finale
","David Yates is credited for having pushed the Harry Potter franchise down a shallow gutter. The last 2 movies in the series were an average fare compared to the previous versions, but with the new Harry Potter movie, he manages to push it all behind, and he might have just brought the franchise back to its glory again. But be warned, if you proceed to watch this movie without having followed the previous movies, or at least have failed to read the books, then this movie will be clear to you as a person who has just been cast the 'Obliviate' spell (which in HP terms, purges a person's memory). Another piece of advice, this movie is much more mature and darker than the previous movies. What started out as a fantasy for kids has moved to the next level and taken over the mantle of a wholesome movie for all the fans of the franchisee.<br/><br/>As usual, the movie starts with the the group trying to get Harry Potter to safety by flying him out of the Godric's Hollow out of reach of Voldemort and his gang of Death-Eaters. Some breathtaking scenes follow it up where he is escorted to the Burrows with the Death-Eaters and Voldemort trying to take him out. The rest of the movie deals with Harry, Ron and Hermione trying to solve the riddle of finding and destroying the Horcruxes.<br/><br/>The first part of the seventh movie definitely is a bit slow but caters out well as the movie progresses. The action scenes have been perfectly orchestrated, and some of the scenes have been shot extremely well. The first half does well to keep the movie audiences well attended. There is rarely a dull moment, but the problem arises after the interval, when the trio spend most of their time in a tent in the wilderness. This is where the movie starts to drag a little and there are long unnecessary stretches which could have been cut out of the movie to eliminate the extra minutes. But it never fails to let the viewer go with its interesting moments that occur at regular intervals. At 2 hours and 26 minutes, you might feel the movie is a bit long, and yes it is indeed. But its worth it. The screenplay is extremely well handled by Steve Kloves. The best part is how Yates plays with the viewer's emotions, especially during the climax where a thrilling part of the movie takes a wild turn and engulfs you with the other side of emotion that you would have never expected. Nonetheless, the high point of this movie is how well it is set-up for the launch of Part-II of the Deathly Hallows and an exceptionally well done animated sequence about a story of three brothers. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson who started out as kids, have grown out of the shell, and have probably given their best performance yet. (Especially Emma and Rupert). A special mention to Peter Mullan who portrays Yaxley, has a very small part, but plays it out extremely well. There are definitely the let-down moments, but the lead-up to the big finale is definitely exciting. Rating: 7.5/10"
"reddy-konudula","6","1","4","20 November 2010"," Read it before you watch it!
","Saw the first show along with my wife who never read any of the Potter series but was infected with my enthusiasm for the first day's show. Throughout the movie I could not stop thinking how she would be feeling as it is impossible to appreciate any scene if you have not read the books. There is where LOTR triumphs.<br/><br/>The movie itself was well made but fails to deliver every time you are expecting a great scene (for those who read the book). Only the 2 min anime sequence is worthy of a mention. Otherwise it feels a bit stretched and the best part of the Potter book is now left for the sequel. In summary, consider it as a 2.5 hour long teaser for the movie coming June 2011"
"axismladen","10","1","4","19 November 2010"," Ten is only because it's a HP movie. I had a lot of fun but....
","First i wanna say that this is not the best Harry Potter and that the only reason i gave it ten is because it's a Harry Potter movie. Don't get me wrong, this is a whole lot of fun and also the most faithful adaptation so far. Unfortunately, that's the problem right there. I'm not sure it was such a good idea to make two movies out of it. They found a part in the book that could be suitable as an ending and they decided to make two movies instead of one. That way they make more money and that way they stay more faithful to the material. However, that part they found good as an ending didn't work well as one. I would say that the only person to blame for this is David Yates. Even though i usually like him as a HP director and i appreciate and am very found of that dark tone that he brought to the series, with this one he made a big mistake. The final 'fight' scene was way too short and way too simple to be a 'final fight' scene. The entire movie would have been a lot better if it was made a bit differently. All needed to be done was to make it a bit slower, and by doing so longer, and a bit more with an attitude, so to say. The entire movie, because of it, really left a hollow impression. Either you read the books or not, you can just tell that it's not finished-that there's something missing.<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Another thing i was disappointed with was Raplh Fiennes. I usually think he's brilliant as Voldemort, but in this movie he was way too silent and he wasn't imposing his character enough. I just didn't see that Voldemort's scary leadership in this movie as i did in HP 4 and 5. I don't know, once again, he was just too silent and unimposing to leave any sort of scary impression on me. <br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was good and i had a lot of fun, but it think it would have worked a lot better with a bit more attitude."

","Wow... how ISN'T this movie amazing? Having grown up (and continuing to grow up) with the series, I can firmly say that this film is the BEST! It is by far the closet to the book! There are many small details and scenes that only a true Harry Potter fan would be able to recognize. I am very glad that the producers decided to split the Deathly Hallows in half... this is obviously needed to really capture the magic of the novel. Not only is this movie accurate, but as a film, it is pretty stunning! The cinematography is simply marvelous! The acting is superb! Being a teenager, I feel as if the characters have grown with me... the film series has grown perfectly with its generation, which gives many viewers that much of a greater experience! I laughed hysterically, I watched in horror, and I cried (all of which I did while reading the book). Cannot wait for Part II, and once again be THAT kid that goes into the theater dressed up not like Harry Potter, but a true Hufflepuff, specifically Ernie McMillan. Keep it coming!!!"

","Harry Potter. How popular is this character? He's become a person, whom, the entire world knows, and to a large extend, adores. I am not a Harry Potter buff, but, I can't deny that it's concept and the world Potter lives in and the powers he and his people are blessed with, are truly innovative.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - 1', which is basically the last part, is now made into two parts cinematically, so that the magic waves for another cinematic experience. However, this Part 1, isn't really the most entertaining Potter film to date.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - 1' begins well, and the battle between the good versus the evil gets more intact, in fact, more violent. As I have not read the book, I have no idea how Rowling plans to end the story, however, this section of the final book is not really nerve biting. One more aspect that goes against this any-way successful film, is it's painfully long running time, which is over a 145-minutes. The film could have easily done away at least by 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>What stands tall in this Potter flick, is it's breath-taking Cinematography by Eduardo Serra. The lens-man captures the exotic locales with remarkable framing and execution. David Yates direction is passable. In the acting front, Daniel Radcliffe continues to be Harry Potter, and shines, yet again. Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron are efficient. Among the other list of supporting actors, Helena Bonham Carter leaves the strongest impression.<br/><br/>On the whole, As my Summary Says in Caps, for Potter Buffs, Only! I didn't really enjoy this one, but buffs will!"
"NJMoon","6","1","5","23 November 2010"," Harry Potter & The World's Longest Camping Trip
","You can't really critique these films. They are more than films. They are visual translations of a cultural phenomenon. They just can't be judged on their cinematic merit alone. I haven't read the books and have no desire to. I have, however, seen all the films. In this (half) film I missed some of my favorite profs from previous outings, especially Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon (who is seen but hardly figures). The villains are really the juice of this final chapter, with Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, and Alan Rickman chewing the scenery in grand style. At one point I wanted to dub this film ""Harry Potter and the World's Longest Camping Trip"". Enough with the teen angst already. Although the impromptu dance sequence between Harry and Hermione is perhaps the film's one touch of humanity - giving the duo a rare moment to be kids, and not muggledom and magic's 'last great hope'. Dobby, too, is in rare form, with his CG denouement played out to perfection. But greed got the better of the studio and led them to stretch a single novel into two films. I would have preferred it had they left on a high note and let us experience Harry's last stand in one fell swoop, but the fans won't mind - like the film itself, it just prolongs the inevitable ending of a cultural icon."

However, this was at last a film that showed the book's story for exactly what it is. No important things missing, almost everything is in! Saw it last night and enjoyed it so much, that by the time it was over, I was eager for more!! <br/><br/>The main trio has come a long way as actors from when they first started these roles and in this one they are very good! They are of course surrounded as usually by a BRILLIANT cast, such as Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs, Ralph Fiennes, Bonham Carter and many more.<br/><br/>Visually the result is awesome!! The airborne chase, the caf√© fight and all action scenes were done beautifully! Story-wise, the only thing left out was the history of Dumbledore and his past connection with Grindelwald, which is important in the Hallows' story, but lets not be too demanding..! Everything else is pretty much like in the book! This movie is darker and sets up the ground for the final battle at Hogwarts and the trio's pursuit of the last Horcruxes! <br/><br/>All in all, kudos to David Yates for finally giving us a Harry Potter movie as it is supposed to be, kudos to the cast for an excellent performance and I can only hope the 2nd Part will be even better!!

"vikas_rawat","10","1","7","19 November 2010"," The best Potter movie yet. Do Not Miss!
","Before you read this, know well that I am a Potter-maniac of the highest degree and anything branded 'Potter' will have my utmost approval. Nevertheless, I will try my best to review this film exactly like it isn't - just another movie.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is, in one word, God-Awesome! Now that I have briefly described the film, I will start with the reasons.<br/><br/>Now for several years, the book fans have complained that the Potter movies take their creative liberty a little too far and deviate considerably from the story to suit cinematic paradigms. But Deathly Hallows truly takes inspiration from the book and remains faithful to even the tiniest plot point. This disproves several critics who claimed that the movie-split decision was purely financial. It is clear that Yates could not have made a single final movie and stayed true to the book at the same time. So splitting seemed obvious, resulting in the Finale getting extended to the delight of fans worldwide. <br/><br/>The film begins, and for most part, maintains a dark, brooding tone that compliments the events of the story. The first part of Deathly Hallows has its own share of shocking deaths. But there is hardly a moment to mourn, as there's a reason to laugh in the very next. The movie starts with the effects the magical world has on Muggles - scenes of the Dursleys leaving their home and Hermoine erasing her parents memory, even as Voldemort tortures the Muggle Studies teacher from Hogwarts, who pleads for help to colleague Snape sitting right at the Dark Lord's side. With Dumbledore gone, Harry's turning of age means he should be put right into a safe house, with the flight from Privet Drive turning out to be an ambush. There-after, the movie proceeds on and this time around, the trio, instead of being on the train to Hogwarts, go around camping across beautiful landscapes to escape the Death Eaters on the prowl and gather clues that would lead them to the next bit of Voldemort's soul. <br/><br/>Now the movie is most definitely the best one in the series so far, simply because it is much more dark and much more strongly driven. There is the slight characteristic dip somewhere in between that we've come to expect from Yates's movies. But otherwise, the film is crackling for most parts, with several moments that bring you to the edge of the seat and immediately throw you back. The music, the locales and the very feel of the film gives you the impression of oncoming dread, and in several ways the film is a perfect set-up to what I can imagine would be a magnanimous end. The movie ends on two notes, one of a burial and another of an un-burial, one tear-jerking while the other gut-wrenching.<br/><br/>Also, the movie truly belongs to the coming-of-age trio of Harry, Ron and Hermoine as there is no one else to hog the screen space this time around. This movie tests the bonds that they've formed over the years like never before. Also, with Dumbledore's absence, Lord Voldemort becomes more visible and the audience gets to see more of him in this film. With a neat and near-flawless execution of a brilliantly written plot, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 definitely sets the tone for the final movie and gets a 4/5 from me. I recommend you go and catch this one right away.<br/><br/>Don't miss."
"jboothmillard","6","1","9","29 November 2010"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
","I was quite surprised when I saw the critics had given this first part to the final instalment in the franchise three stars out of five, but I went to see it anyway, and I wish I could say I didn't agree. Basically Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is growing stronger with power, with the help of his dark army of minions, including Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) with father Lucius (Jason Isaacs), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and the many Death Eaters. To take over the wizard world the main threat is the chosen one who could end the whole thing, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is leaving his home with the Dursleys, Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) with the help of the Order of the Phoenix. All the members, including friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the elders at Hogwarts, Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), are willing to protect Harry even if it means death. With the help of the Polyjuice Potion, Harry escapes and those that remain hide at the Weasleys house, where the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) gives Harry, Ron and Hermione the items on the last will and testament of recently killed and still mourned Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon). At the wedding of Bill Weasley (Domhnall Gleeson) and Fleur Delacour (Cl√©mence Po√©sy) there is an attack by Death Eaters, and Harry, Ron and Hermione transport to London, where they find the next Horcrux, the key to ending the evil tirade. This Horcurx, a locket, is stolen at one point by someone in the Ministry of Magic, an associate of Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), but with the Polyjuice Potion to disguise they get it back. The three friends then transport themselves to an empty wood to set up camp and hide from the evil forces, and also try to find a way to destroy the locket, which when worn can increase emotions, especially anger. While Voldermort hears of a legendary Elder Wand which he could use to kill Harry, Ron disappears after becoming jealous of Harry with Hermione, thinking that they are falling for each other, which they are not. Without Ron the two of them stay in the woods, they find out from Bathilda Bagshot (Hazel Douglas) that the famous sword of Godric Gryffindor may be what can destroy the Horcrux, and they visit the grave of Harry's parents Lily and James, and Ron comes back to save Harry and destroy the locket. Next the trio visit Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans), father of Luna (Evanna Lynch), to learn of the symbol they have seen a few places, he explains it is the Deathly Hallows (the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility). After being captured by the Death Eaters, Hermione is slowly tortured by Bellatrix, with Harry and Ron in the wine cellar who are saved by Dobby (Toby Jones), and there is a small battle before they transport themselves out. In the end, Dobby was injured while transporting Harry, Ron, Hermione and one or two others, they bury him on the beach they landed on, and also Voldermort has found the Elder Wand he can kill Harry with, buried in the coffin of Dumbledore, to be continued... Also starring John Hurt as Ollivander, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Nick Moran as Scabior, Sophie Thompson as Mafalda Hopkirk, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Michael Byrne as Gellert Grindelwald. The three leading young stars are still reliable, maybe particularly Grint, the idea of mainly the three of them on a road trip is I suppose a good getaway from the school, but all the other actors don't get to do much. The special effects are still great, the animated sequence telling the Deathly Hallows story is beautiful, and there are still some good action style moments, but I didn't feel as enthralled as the all four star previous films, but it is an enjoyable enough family fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Make Up/Hair. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Good!"

But throughout the movie I found myself glancing away at times, not interested in the temporary teenage drama which seemingly is a recurring theme in all later Harry Potter movies, Harry, Hermione and Ron all run away from the group at one point in time, this movie no different.<br/><br/>Secondly I found the directing a bit messy with odd cuts and extremely shaky and zoomed in shots during actons scenes, particularly during the forest snatcher scene. Also during the first escape scene where Harry meets Voldemort for like 5 seconds and boom its over, next scene, they were almost instantly both using their wands playing ''tug of war''.<br/><br/>Thirdly there were some weird character inserts imo, Dobby felt forced in out of nowhere and *spoiler* let off in the finale just to give the movie some stakes.<br/><br/>So in general I still enjoyed it, especially the start, but sadly it did tend to drag on, most likely because its the build up but alas, its still a standalone movie."

"ThomasDrufke","9","0","2","17 November 2016"," Brilliant Set-up
","There have been quite a few times, especially recently, when dividing the last story of a franchise into two parts was a huge mistake. But then there is the Harry Potter series, which managed to make a well- strung first part, which ranks among the franchise's best, to set up one of the greatest conclusions in film history.<br/><br/>Upon first viewing, I wasn't a huge fan of the first Deathly Hallows. To me, it was missing its own identity and conclusion to feel like its own film. Of course, this was before having seen part 2. Now that I have gone back and re-watched each film, I have grown more of an appreciation for the series as a whole, and particularly, Deathly Hallows Part 1. There are certainly still some minute problems that can be annoying, like Voldemort's minimal presence, but this was the first movie that solely focused on the trio of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. That was a welcomed shift for me.<br/><br/>After the last 3 films, it seemed like the series had already grown up enough. But I like the fact that this film wasn't just them cutting ties with their family and loved ones to find horcruxes, it was about them becoming adults capable of doing things on their own. So in many ways, this is a film about unity and independence at the same time. I love watching the trio have to go on the road and figure out all of the horcruxes without the help of their parents or Dumbledore. It makes the payoff in the 8th movie all the more gratifying.<br/><br/>This may be a stretch, but this film feels a lot like a Western set in the Potterverse. In fact, there are a lot of the same characteristics as a revenge or fantasy-western. On the run, looking for something significant, and constantly fighting off the looming presence of a bigger evil. To me, that's a fantasy western. <br/><br/>No matter, the film has its fair share of thrilling sequences of action along with some needed heartfelt moments between the trio. The relationship particularly between Harry and Hermione has never been a focus, in fact rarely touched upon, until this film. Even though there's nothing romantic at all, it became one of the series' most endearing bonds. Of course, Ron didn't seem to think so, as he got jealous in the most clich√©d way possible. But again, Harry and Ron needed that conflict to make the payoff of Ron coming back to save Harry and destroying a Horcrux all the more satisfying.<br/><br/>Plenty of other noteworthy sequences include a brilliantly thoughtful Tale of the 3 Brothers story told by Hermione, Dobby's return, Umbridge's unsettling return, and even the opening escape sequence. I know it isn't beloved by the fandom like the others, but I believe Deathly Hallows is a necessary deviation from the typical trip to the Potterverse so that part 2 is as epic as we know it is. Love this film.<br/><br/>+The trio. The whole time<br/><br/>+Returns of beloved characters<br/><br/>+Maturation process for the trio<br/><br/>+Search for the Horcruxes<br/><br/>+So many reveals and set ups<br/><br/>9.3/10"

","This film is the adaptation of half of the seventh and final book in the saga of Harry Potter, written by J.K. Rowling, and was directed by David Yates. In this film and the next, Yates reaches a point of true excellence. Always supported and anchored in its central cast, virtually unchanged since the beginning of the saga, he will use all his wide budget to create a true masterpiece divided into two films, two parts of a whole practically perfect.<br/><br/>Warner Brothers showed all his talent and capabilities with regard to the computerization and use of special effects by advanced computing techniques. Also the actors reached huge levels of psychological complexity and dramatically performances, especially the three protagonists, involved in a triangle of love and jealousy that exists only inside the head of one of them. The hunt for the Orcruxes will be a challenge for everyone and will, eventually, test the three characters like never before. They are out of school, away from the castle (which never appears in the film) and will have to use all the acquired knowledge to overcome their challenges.<br/><br/>Drama, romance, jealousy, pain, a confrontation with a hidden past of Dumbledore and three talismans that can change the fate of war.

"joeravioli","8","0","2","2 August 2015"," The Black Sheep of the Franchise
","The first time I watched this film, I was bored out of my skull. I left the film with the impression that it was the most pointless film in the franchise. Granted, I was eleven years old. But even as I matured and provided the franchise with a ridiculous amount of day-long marathons, I always skipped over this film, thinking that I was avoiding a useless addition to the series that was universally disliked for its meandering slowness. But recently, I gave it an honest effort, and boy, was I surprised. As a summer blockbuster, it falls flat on its face. But as a brooding and powerful film that depicts the characters that I know and love being forced to mature in the real world, it excels beyond any other of the films in the franchise.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 begins with Harry, Ron, and Hermione preparing to hunt Voldemort's Horcruxes, or pieces of his soul, in order to finally defeat him. But they are forced to undertake this task on their own. Dumbledore, having died, is no longer there to guide their quest. Thus, the trio now faces their most difficult challenge yet. They have barely anything to go off of in the search, and don't even have a weapon with which they can kill the Horcruxes.<br/><br/>They are forced to wander the land aimlessly, slowly piecing things together, dodging Snatchers and spending many a day trekking across vast landscapes wonderfully captured with stunning cinematography. Even the action scenes, which are very sparse in this film, are subtly spectacular, director David Yates taking an often minimalistic, yet effective approach to every frantic shot. The scene in which the trio runs away from the Snatchers is definitely one of my favourite scenes in the whole franchise.<br/><br/>But it is in this film that we see these characters as actual human beings, capable of sadness, anger, and loneliness. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all have their little bouts with each other as their emerging personalities clash. Ron is no longer the comic relief. He becomes the one who actually has something to lose. Harry is no longer the proud little boy. He is driven by the guilt he feels towards his mistakes and perhaps even his existence. Hermione is no longer the nerdy little girl. She becomes instead the lonely woman, attempting to keep her friends together after removing herself from her own family. This added depth of humanity is what drives the film, much unlike the previous films which were driven by action and an overall sense of wonder. It is surprisingly mature coming from a franchise about witchcraft and wizardry.<br/><br/>This film understands its roots, and pays them tribute by adding humanity to them. In the first scene of the film, Harry waits in Number Four, Privet Drive for Order of the Phoenix to arrive. As he walks through the empty house, he expresses a certain fondness for it, despite the hardships that he endured there. In a way, he forgives it."
"vishaal811","9","0","2","15 July 2015"," No Hogwarts. No Problems.
","The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the first Harry Potter movie that is not set in Hogwarts as Harry Potter is on a quest to find and destroy all the Horcruxes. This does not dissipate the excitement and in fact it has improved the story as the main characters are not bound by anything.<br/><br/>As this is a two part movie, the first movie acts as a set up to the final movie due to which the ending seems unresolved which may by disappointing for some. However, most of the movie builds up to a crescendo which will likely be ending with a rousing climax in the second part.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful as all the lead characters return for this film. Due to the increasing difficulty in making any progress, Ron gets extremely frustrated and even leaves Harry and Hermione only to return later. <br/><br/>Other Technical Aspects of this film is solid as usual. As the director is the same as that for the previous two films, it makes it much easier to work in a world that has already been developed vividly. <br/><br/>After watching this movie, I cannot wait for the second movie. I would suggest to everyone to watch the two parts back to back as it will deliver the greatest amount of satisfaction."
"willcundallreview","8","0","2","12 July 2015"," A fine display of magical emotion
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is of course the first part of the end for Harry and all of his world who are stuck in some dangerous times. Voldemort is getting stronger and this is the first time we truly see raw emotion and drama, our young actors are getting better and the movies are getting oh so much darker. This for me is the first Harry Potter where drama rules the roost, it doesn't take those fantasy and family elements too heavily and what comes of this is a deeply insightful look at the characters emotions.<br/><br/>Our plot follows basically anyone who is facing the wrath of Lord Voldemort and his dreaded death eaters, people are being killed everyday and even though they aren't characters we know, it still brings a more human touch to an otherwise magical affair. For me this is the point where Daniel Radcliffe's career in acting becomes solid, sure he has been doing this for years and years but this is him acting to his highest potential and the most skillful heights.<br/><br/>David Yates yet again takes the helm and although I didn't feel he does very well, still does this well enough, I'm not the keenest on Yates's direction style but he never does a bad job though. I think the same goes for the adapted screenplay, not the finest of fine but it is still done well too and can at times actually create some of the most interesting scenes we have seen in Harry Potter. I think one area that this movie truly improves upon is the technical side, the special effects are absolutely flawless, made to perfection and the cinematography is as always wonderful, that's one point I feel is looked over with Harry Potter, the cinematography. <br/><br/>A reason I think this is so fine and for me personally one of the best in the series is that it just breathes emotion, it isn't afraid of mixing the dark times with comedy and characters such as Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) provide that. This movie I have seen is sometimes considered too slow, too much talking and maybe a little bit over long, I disagree. I found it to be exciting throughout, you never know what will happen next(unless you know the books of course), but even then it is still pulsating. <br/><br/>A thing to mention for this film is the score, the long shadow of John Williams still hangs over the series but I feel it has now been taken off with a fine score from Alexandre Desplat. Desplat for me makes one of the best there has been in the series, the film is made much more tense with his style of music and particularly around the beginning his score is loud and triumphant but also brings the situation facing Harry and others down to earth. The design is also one of the best I have seen, the sets are fantastic and the choices of locations to shoot are breathtaking, this truly for me continues the step up the series took in Half-Blood Prince.<br/><br/>Overall this movie surprised me, I have viewed this many times but never truly appreciated the heart of this movie, but also the dark side too. Full of action but also long conversations, many may consider this too long and boring to watch but for me this is a fine entry and sets up Part 2 in the best way it could do. Recommendation wise this actually is the first Harry Potter I feel the little kids may not like, it has it's scary moments and also very black scenes too, but they are done so well."

"msloane1","10","0","2","6 February 2015"," A Different Side of Harry Potter
","The progression of the Harry Potter movies getting steadily darker as they go along, from the charming and innocent Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to the dark and emotionally intense Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is well documented. But Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 goes a step further. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 takes the series outside its Hogwarts comfort zone and on the road. And the Wizarding World is now in the midst of a full blown war. While many of the events that occurred in Half Blood Prince setup the war, now this IS the war. With Harry, Ron and Hermione unable to return to Hogwarts, and, in any case, having to fulfill their mission for Dumbledore, the vast majority of Deathly Hallows Part 1 is set with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the road on the hunt to find and destroy Horcuxes. Thus, this movie is very different from any other in the Harry Potter series. While all the other Harry Potter stories either are school stories or at least have elements of school stories, Deathly Hallows Part 1 has none of that. Instead, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a more like a quest story. We get to some very familiar and beloved characters in a totally different type of setting and story. This both gives a freshness to a familiar series and makes this movie unique within the series. This is a major positive and adds another element to the Harry Potter series. It was also quite refreshing that this movie had none of that retarded romance garbage that was unfortunately included in the previous three Harry Potter movies. This movie keeps its eye on the ball and rarely strays from what's important to the plot. There aren't really any significant cast or character additions in this volume. Instead it's all about those characters we've loved for a long time. Daniel and Emma are fantastic in the lead roles and Evanna and Ralph Fiennes are splendid in their roles as Luna and Voldemort. And Helena Bonham Carter is delicious in her role as Bellitrix Lestrange. The most notable newbie is Bill Nighty as Scrimgouer. While this character does play some important roles such as giving Harry, Ron, Hermione the bequests Dumbledore had left them that proved important late, this character received too little screen time for his casting to be that important although Nighty does a good job in the role. The pacing is appropriate for the story being told. It is slower paced than its predecessors but the story being told here calls for being told at a slower pace much of the time. The music is good. I still would have preferred John Williams to have scored the entire series but the score here is high quality and appropriate to the film. The very best part of this movie is its awesome special effects and visuals. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a beautifully shot film with some of the best production quality you will ever find. The cinematography is perfect. The filmmakers threw an 80 yard touchdown pass with their production work on this movie. The movie is reasonably faithful to the book. Most of the main events are included and portrayed faithfully. The main thing that book readers will notice lacking in the film is that there is much less focus on and less of Dumbledore's back story than in the book. I have no problem with this as the movies have always (rightfully) chosen to focus on Harry's story when doing the book to movie transition so issues less about him get less play. A change that I really liked was not using Polyjuice Potion for the Godric's Hollow trip. This made that part of the movie have more meaning and feel more genuine. You can really feel it when Harry says""This is where I was born. I'm not coming back as someone else. The movie is highly successful at bringing out emotions and this is most obvious during Dobby's death. This is a very moving scene. This movie should only be viewed by people in middle school or older as this movie has some violent parts, including the torture parts at Malfoy Manor that are not appropriate to be seen by elementary school children. Dobby's death is also too emotionally intense for those below middle school. Faithfulness to the book: 9 out of 10. Casting and Acting: 10 out of 10. Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 8 out of 10. Special effects and visuals: 11 out of 10. Overall: 10 out of 10."

","Before I go into how bloody blinding part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is, let me give a recap to those of you who aren't au fait with the Harry Potter phenomena.<br/><br/>Harry Potter, based on the seven book fantasy series by J.K. Rowling, follows the life of a boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) who discovers he is a wizard on his first adolescent birthday. As a young wizard he is sent to magic school, Hogwarts Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he befriends Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger(Emma Watson). They become good mates and deal with a series of problems regarding the dark lord of the wizardry world, Voldemort.<br/><br/>Their good-nature and combination of skills aids them in defeating the dark lord in the final book of the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. With many hardships and fruitful memories along the way, the trio succeed in solidifying their names in wizard history, and make for an unforgettable tale. <br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows puts the kibosh on Hogwarts in part one and throws Potter, Weasley, and Granger into a wilderness of secrets awaiting discovery. Though I am familiar with the books, thrilling action scenes sent me on a tycoon of emotions. All the frightening death eaters, snakes, and attacks are visually engaging and glue your eyes to the screen. Sound effects, in particular Granger's screams, resonated through your body and made you retreat into the depths of your seat.<br/><br/>Though at times a the film is a tear-jerker, humorous moments emerged. A memorable scene occurred when Harry's comrades drank polyjuice potion to physically transform into Harry to fool unwanted guests. Let me tell you, a bunch of Harry's in a mishmash of outfits is a sight to see.<br/><br/>One of the main differences between part one of the Deathly Hallows and the other Harry Potter films was the failure to miss key elements of the story plot. It included everything and there was no arsing about in the lengthy two and a half hours of run-time which felt much shorter. <br/><br/>David Yates generally stuck to the book but also incorporated his own parts. When Dobby dies, Yates gets Harry to calmly request a proper burial for the elf instead of throwing a benny and going into social withdrawal.<br/><br/>Another scene that does not go by the book is the dance shared by Granger and Potter when Weasley has left their group. Offering his own connotations to the film does not alter the message of the story as a whole. Adding little snippets of originality strengthens his role as director and contributes to the development of the plot in cinematic form. Another Yates addition to look out for is a visual reference made to a famous Michelangelo painting in a catatonic scene with Weasley and Granger.<br/><br/>Brap from the audience emanated in theatres before the movie even started. Long lines to get into various showings of the movie were present hours before it would even be seating. The IMAX showing I attended welcomed a particularly excited crowd. Applaud and hoots of joy exploded when each of the main characters first appeared on screen. Coming in with high expectations and leaving with a great but empty experience left much of the audience, including myself, yearning for more.<br/><br/>The movie is split into two parts to offer more play time to portray all the important parts from the book onto the screen, tickling our fancies and knocking us fans off our trolleys for waiting so long to see this smashing film. The huge gap between the first and second releases is one of, if not the biggest, flaw to the film. The ending stalls halfway through the book leaving you hanging even though you (likely) know how the rest goes.<br/><br/>Though long awaited, as it has been pushed back by Twilight twice, it was worth the wait to see the latest gobsmacking Harry Potter film. <br/><br/>Bloody: (in this case) surprising Blinding: successful, fantastic Au fait: familiar Puts the kibosh on: puts an end to Tear-jerker: may cause tearful emotions Arsing about: wasting time Throwing a benny: throwing a fit, tantrum Brap: excitement Tickling our fancies: pleasing to us Off our trolleys: gone crazy Smashing: super Gobsmacking: amazing"

","Based on the final novel of the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows marks the end of an era that saw an entire generation grow up with this deeply fascinating world of magic. Presented in 2 parts, it is the finale of what eventually became a worldwide phenomenon during the first decade of the 21st century, both in the world of books & cinema.<br/><br/>Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 finds the trio of Harry, Ron & Hermione embarking on a new journey to finish Dumbledore's work by finding & destroying the remaining horcruxes of Lord Voldemort. And in their grim adventure where danger awaits at every corner, they come to learn about the Deathly Hallows while The Dark Lord prepares to take over the Wizarding World.<br/><br/>The direction by David Yates is pretty good as the film adapts the novel very faithfully this time & in much greater detail. But it's also slowed down by most of the action being moved on to the final chapter. The technical aspects continue to impress once again as it properly balances its story while Alexandre Desplat's score brings a flavour of its own into the film although it remains within the realms of this magical world.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the focus is finally on the three primary leads of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint & Emma Watson and each one of them chips in with a performance that's highly improved compared to its predecessors. Yet, in my opinion, it's Helena Bonham Carter in her sinister portrayal of Bellatrix Lestrange who enters the film during its final moments & still ends up stealing the show with her terrific performance.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is incredibly faithful to its source material, has moments of action in bits n pieces but the focus this time is mainly on the drama than visuals and it also features an amazing work of animation in one scene that's easily my favourite moment. It might turn out to be boring for some but for me it lays down the perfect groundwork for the next chapter. Certainly not the best of the series but definitely not the worst either."

","I, like many, have read the Harry Potter heptalogy many, many times and treasure it as part of my childhood. That being said I was always very critical of all the movie adaptations because I felt they compromised some of the best parts of the books to appeal to a ""mass audience."" That being said, I thought this movie brilliantly balanced book with film. <br/><br/>Along with lush cinematography, this film actually stayed true to the book content! In my opinion, ""Deathly Hallows"" was probably the most adaptable of all HP books because the quest of destroying the horcruxes and killing Voldy is made quite clear at the end of HBP. Part One followed the story line as closely as the run time would permit. <br/><br/>My only complaints were the awkward sexual-esque scene involving the locket horcrux. That was just weird haha. Aside from that, the movie actually seemed out of place with the past 6 because it was so in-depth and true to the content. The ending also had to be one of the best I've experienced in an HP film; It really got you pumped for part two which (spoiler alert...it SUCKED)<br/><br/>Of course I recommend that everyone read the books over the movie, but if you want to watch the movies, THIS is the best one by far!"

","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is the seventh and penultimate movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one we have Harry Potter racing time to destroy all the Horcruxes but in his investigation he finds three powerful objects of the wizarding world and these are the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because it's the introduction of the second part of Deathly Hallows and it introduces us to the final battle of good with evil. I also believe that this separation of the final movie of Harry Potter in two parts was really great and gave us more time to think and understand all the story of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Finally I think that this movie of Harry Potter is one of the greatest movies of the Harry Potter series."
"axel-koch","8","0","2","12 January 2014"," A perfect set-up for the finale of this fantastic franchise.
","With the first part of the last film in the Harry Potter franchise, every detractor of the infamous book splitting is silenced, as the plot has to be told extraordinarily quickly, regardless of the two and a half hours running time. This is simultaneously one of the film's gravest downsides and greatest features with a major scene, important exposition, or character introduction happening every ten minutes and the moments for breathing being sparse. If you've read the seventh book and are in an attentive state of mind while watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1, you can just sit back and enjoy a rather felicitous amalgam of action, thrill, and drama. If you are a stranger to J.K. Rowling's novels, however, watching this film will definitely be a highly confusing experience for you.<br/><br/>Since I belong to the first category, it's difficult to elaborate on this, but Deathly Hallows 1 sure feels rushed and the franchise's regular screenwriter Steve Kloves didn't do the best job in the admittedly very challenging adaptation of the novel. This also pertains to the dialogues, with some of them blatantly serving the sole purpose of moving the story forward, and the relations between the characters. But enough of the grumbling, because David Yates has hereby realised yet another marvellous chapter in the life of the now grownup Harry Potter, for which he surely deserves some praise.<br/><br/>The visuals have always been one of the greatest assets of the Harry Potter films and this doesn't change at all in Deathly Hallows 1. Much more, the whole crew did a phenomenal job in giving the penultimate instalment in the series a most interesting look, whether it's for the lovely new sets, such as Godric's Hollow, the Lovegood house, and the Malfoy Manor, the visual effects that play a substantial part in making the film's action scenes as entertaining as they turn out to be, or the gritty cinematography, showing Harry's desperate situation in fittingly dark shades. However small a scene in these films might be, there's always minute focus laid on its staging, which is, in my opinion, what lets you forget some of the sloppier plot segments.<br/><br/>The film may be too complex to grasp the first time watching it and also doesn't exactly spare clich√©s and silly exposition conversations, yet is still a rich and multiply-layered film that succeeds in including all the necessary genres and making it seem genuine. All of this is due to a top-notch crew and a huge gathering of immensely talented British actors, this time expanded by Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans above others. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 is intense, moving, and highly entertaining and serves as a perfect set-up for the finale of this fantastic franchise."
"colleenmgannon14","9","0","2","7 November 2013"," As the wizarding world crumbles, Harry and his friends set out to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes.
","As the seventh installment in the famous Harry Potter series, The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a two and a half hour escape from reality. The wizarding trio that fans have grown to love sets out to tackle their greatest challenge yet. As a fast-paced, jam-packed adventure with perfect character chemistry, incredible special effects, and a whirlwind plot line, you will be sucked into the magical wizarding world to follow Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Watson), and Ron (Grint) on their journey.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, the sacrifices that Harry's friends are willing to make for him are demonstrated. A group of friends, mentors, and professors meet Harry at his house to transport him to a safe house. As soon as they leave, they are met by Death Eaters and engage in a battle. Many of those who helped transport Harry were either killed or seriously injured. Harry remembers this and repays them later by fighting Lord Voldemort, risking his life to destroy the Horcruxes, and putting himself in front of his friends during other battles. The willingness of characters to sacrifice for each other displays the chemistry between them.<br/><br/>The bond between Harry, Hermione, and Ron is the strongest, although there is jealousy and romance at times. Harry and Hermione are very close‚Äîbut only as friends. Ron thinks otherwise and develops feelings of jealousy and anger. These feelings cause him to leave the group for a short amount of time. However, Ron is drawn back to the group by his friendship with Harry and love for Hermione. The character dynamics and chemistry of this film‚Äîthe sacrifices, friendship, romance, and envy‚Äîmake it one that all audiences can relate to on a personal level.<br/><br/>The film is relatable on a personal level as well as realistic on a digital level. The special effects of The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 make it believable. Whether it be the characters flying through London on broomsticks to destroying a locket with a sword creating a cloud of shadowy figures to an old woman transforming into a giant serpent, the special effects make the film seamless and realistic. They make the impossible seem possible. They turn the scary scenes terrifying, the dramatic scenes intense, and the suspenseful scenes into nail-biting, sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat thrillers.<br/><br/>The special effects would have no purpose if it weren't for the incredible scenes they were needed for. The entire two hours and 26 minutes is packed with attention-capturing scenes. Some scenes stimulate your mind as others tug at your heartstrings. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment in this film. The opening scene leads into a suspenseful fight guaranteed to raise your pulse. Immediately following this scene is a humbling interaction between brothers where it is uncertain if one will live to see the next day. Although there are a few moments in the middle of the movie that create a lull with Harry, Hermione, and Ron deciding their next move on their journey, it creates a great contrast to the following action scene. When reflecting on the film, no moments of true boredom come to mind.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 combines character chemistry, special effects, and an eventful plot line into a masterpiece of a film. You get it all‚Äîromance, jealousy, fights, magic, and more. For anyone who has read the books or takes a liking to action and suspense, this film is for you. Younger children may want to watch it with an adult simply because certain dark characters may be seen as frightening, not because of language or graphic/sexual content. All viewers will enjoy at least one aspect of this film, making it a temporary escape from reality and into the magical wizarding world of Harry Potter."

","Harry Potter story took a turn and came out of the world of fairy tales into the real world with realistic real-life emotions and problems, while still giving the viewer the amazing and cruel world of dark magic. This movie is scary, this movie is suspense, this movie is romantic. It keeps you on the edge of the seat and makes it hard to wait for the conclusion of the series. Ralph Fiennes is kicking butt, but what is also apparent is how a small boy Daniel Radcliffe turned from an insignificant child franchise actor into a world class award worthy talent. Ron Weasley is over-acting as always, but it works for him in this one. A tragic death of an imaginary character ""Elf"" was so meaningful and foretelling that it watered my eyes. A story about the deathly hallows, was like a movie inside a movie. It took a viewer out of the Harry Potter movie into a different world (different both artistically and thematically) - it was a brilliant spark of genius imagination of J.K. Rowling, and would be worthy to watch just by itself."
"g-bodyl","10","0","2","12 January 2013"," Bleakest But Most Mature Harry Potter Film Yet!
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the total opposite of what the Sorcerer's Stone was. The young leads are more mature in this film and the film is by far the most dreary and bleakest thanks to great cinematography by Eduardo Serra. The decision to turn Deathly Hallows into two parts is a very wise one. <br/><br/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione returns in the seventh installment of the very popular Harry Potter franchise. They head out to hunt down the Horcruxes in order to destroy Voldemort. But while they do that, they must deal with dark forces chasing them, fear for loved ones, and above all each other.<br/><br/>Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson deliver their most mature performances yet. As the series progressed, they have increasingly gotten better. One thing I always liked about the Potter films is the large supporting cast and how they manage to be effective. Once again, they were very effective in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is David Yate's best Harry Potter film to date. The story is constructed well thanks to a tight screenplay by Steve Kloves. This film also tends to be emotional at times especially the beginning scene and several of the final scenes. There are also some welcome character returns from previous installments. All in all, this may be the best Harry Potter film yet. I rate this film 10/10."
"joben-525-633946","8","0","2","21 December 2012"," Potter Gold!
","Certainly for 'Part 1', 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' is a beautiful looking film for its striking visuals and breathtaking landscapes.<br/><br/>With there to be no seventh year at Hogwarts for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) we see him, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) began their search for the Horcruxes - the seven parts of Voldermort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul that have been separated into seven pieces. On their perilous journey, the three encounter many dangers and the power of hatred radiated by the horcurxes threatens to separate the heroic trio.<br/><br/>The characters in this seventh Potter film are excellently portrayed and have detailed characteristics. 'Part 1' of the movie is based more around the emotional weight carried by Radcliffe, Watson and Grint during their treacherous journey, which brings intertextuality from 'The Lord of The Rings'. Instead of action and humour, a serious more adult tone is present. However, the various landscapes and background imagery is something you can instantly fall in love with.<br/><br/>The only criticisms I have is 'Part 1' clearly just an introductory part which sets up 'Part 2', the main and more exciting part. Also, the film can flow a little slowly on occasions and you sort of miss the whole Hogwarts surroundings which have been present throughout the movies. <br/><br/>Other than the above, it's a great movie assisting the beginning of the end."
"parallel_projection","8","0","2","23 August 2012"," Fantastic, but not without some major mistakes
","This movie is very fast-paced, thrilling, dark, and overall well-done. A lot of material needed to be fit into a short amount of time, and although it is fast-paced, it never seems like you're being left behind. Director David Yates also does an amazing job at making it feel a lot more mature--you can definitely tell that everything is starting to build upon itself. <br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, it should be no surprise by now that the Harry Potter movie always have great acting. Harry, Ron, and especially Hermione do a fantastic job while on the run-- you can the they stress, fear, sadness, love, and determination in their faces. The supporting cast is also very good, especially Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, and Rhys Ifans. Additionally, David O'Hara, Steffan Rhodri, and Sophie Thompson do really incredible jobs as Harry, Ron, and Hermione impersonating the Ministry officials they represent.<br/><br/>There are, however, some big mistakes in this film that I'm surprised J. K. Rowling, being a producer, let slip by. For one thing, the scene explaining how Voldemort's name is taboo was deleted, so the action over at Xeno's house can be a little confusing. Also, for some reason Dobby knocks out Pettigrew at Malfoy Manor, instead of having his hand choke him to death. This is a huge mistake, as Pettigrew owed his life to Harry, and, at least in the movies, never repays it. Lastly, the scenes with the Dursley's were cut extremely short--poor Fiona Shaw only has about five seconds of screen time, but a brilliant deleted scene. There are also a ton more smaller mistakes, but they are more understandable considering what they packed into the running-time.<br/><br/>What they did do right, however, was the telling of the Tale of the Three Brothers. The entire sequence is animated is a sort of shadowy two-dimensional formant, and it was simply fantastic. The whole concept behind that was really ingenious, and it was very well-done. Another positive is Alexandre Despalt's enthralling musical score, which perfectly suits the adventurous feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>So even though there were definitely some huge mistakes in this film, it is still a great lead-in to the final film, and definitely worth the watch. It never gets boring, as many people said, and at times it is even comical--I was entertained the whole way."
"iwatheblind-369-566957","10","0","1","13 May 2012"," Best in the series
","This is better than the third episode (The Prisoner of Azkaban) and much better than the rest of the films. Given the overall average quality of the Harry Potter films, the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stands out like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Unlike the rest of the series, it manages to convey the entire essence of the (half) book and the characters' emotions and thoughts without the infuriating inconsistencies we saw in the other episodes. The beginning was particularly strong and I find the bleak atmosphere even more nicely done than the noir tone in the Prisoner of Azbakan.<br/><br/>It's a shame the second part of the Deathly Hallows does not live up to expectations, mainly due (again) to some serious script errors. The last, amazingly powerful, book deserved a more faithful final film. As it is, Deathly Hallows Part 1 is by far the best in the series."
"trixie-k-88","10","0","1","14 April 2012"," The best of the series to begin our farewell
","We're nearing the end of the long-running Harry Potter epic. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has been split into two films. Is it going to be a great success or just a ploy for the film makers to squeeze an extra billion out of us? <br/><br/>Dumbledore is dead, Voldemort is quickly working to take control of the Ministry, and Harry will become a legal adult on July 31st. Time is running out, and it's very clear that the three kids we have grown to love over a decade are not kids anymore. Harry, Ron and Hermione have chosen not to finish their last year in Hogwarts, and are preparing to go on a mission to find and destroy Voldemort before he takes over the world. Shortly before he turns 17, the remaining members of the Order help assist Harry back to the Weasley home in an intense battle with Death Eaters (and Voldemort) in the sky. Harry is feeling guilty over some deaths and injuries during the battle, but everyone else at the Burrow is preparing for the wedding of Bill, the eldest Weasley son to Fleur Delacour. But Bill and Fleur's wedding is interrupted by a frightening message that the Ministry has been taken over by Voldemort and the Death Eaters, so Harry, Ron and Hermione flee as quickly as possible. We follow them as they go around the Wizarding and Muggle world in search of horcruxes and attempting to destroy them. Through the clues that Dumbledore left and the help of Luna's father Xenophilius (Rhys Ifans), they discover that Voldemort is in search of the ""Deathly Hallows"", three objects that will make him invincible. Emotions run high as both personal frustrations and ill will of Voldemort's seeps into the three best friends and tries to destroy them. Will they manage to destroy the horcruxes and find the Deathly Hallows before Voldemort becomes more powerful than ever? <br/><br/>This is probably the best Harry Potter film they ever made, I absolutely love it. The acting is great, the emotions depicted are intense, special effects are good, the fight scenes are exciting and any fan will be completely glued to the screen. One thing that I feel sets this film apart from the others is the pacing. Even the better paced Harry Potter films feel a bit rushed, as I imagine it's hard to fit a 4-700 page book into less than three hours of film. But this book was given an entire 4.5 hours to allow as much as possible, and thank goodness for that! There isn't as much happening in this film and some people find that boring, but I find it proof that they put a lot of effort into the film instead of just using it as a money maker. The characters in Harry Potter are deep, meaningful, and realistic in their own way. The film makers know their fans have grown to love and care for these people, and allowing us to watch their inner turmoil in some silence allows us to truly process and feel everything they have experienced‚Äîand that we have shared with them. It would have been better for them to include some other information the sixth film left out, but on the other hand that might have muddled up the plot and quieter tone of this film. The only criticisms I have of this is that they left out Tonks' announcement that she and Remus were having a child. This just irks me because it could have been done with just a few more seconds in the scene where the Order comes to the Dursley house. Other than that nitpick this film follows the first half of the book wonderfully, and flows very well on screen. Its only downfalls are the information the sixth film left out (particularly where the mirror shard came from and why Harry has it). This truly is the best Harry Potter film of the series, and a good way to start us off in saying goodbye to our favorite witches and wizards."
"Kieth11","10","0","1","25 March 2012"," Very good beginning to an excellent ending
","This is a movie that should not be missed. It has it all, action, adventure, and fantasy. This I think is a bit better than part 2, simply because it has more action, and more suspense, which I love in movies. Many scenes that just give me the chills, although it is animated and on the ""unrealistic"" side of things. Such as when Ron gets shot by some spell and you see his skin on his arm is gone, and Hermine uses something that she puts on his arm, and you hear a sizzling sound. The ending of the movie is really good, and gets you really pumped up for part 2, when Voltemort (don't know how to spell that) get's the most powerful wand in the world. There are many scenes that make you tense up, and makes you feel as if there is a spider crawling down your back. For those of you that like feeling dread, and a little scared, this is the move for you."

","I believe its fair to say that Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was a huge disappointed and from here on many people lost their faith in David Yates's ability to direct the remaining Harry Potter films. However, when I realized the final Harry Potter film would then be split into two separate films I was pleased. It was a good choice, and so I had much higher hopes.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows Part 1 was a very well made Harry Potter film. The story stuck very loyal to the novel and didn't try anything fancy. The cast did great and most of the story was very well done. There were a few changes, but this didn't end up effecting the film too much. One example is when both Dobby and Kreacher both captured Mundungus Fletcher. This turned out to be a great film with all these great scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes were 'The Seven Potters', 'Grimmauld Place', 'Infiltration of Ministry', 'Lovegood' and 'Malfoy Manor'. Also, the Forest Chase scene was quite a great addition to the film and I loved it.<br/><br/>This film was great, lets just hope that the finale will be just as good."

It was really exciting, building up to part 2 amazingly. The acting was excellent and the screenplay was well adapted. The visual effects were amazing as always, adding to the magic and the dramatic Harry-Voldemort fight scene. The only thing that bothered me was the beginning of the movie.

"Doylenf","7","0","1","2 December 2011"," Fascinating but ""darker than dark"" prelude to the finale...
","These hallows are not only ""deathy,"" they're ""darker than dark."" Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.<br/><br/>Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.<br/><br/>The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Volemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.<br/><br/>Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters."
"elizabeth-byers1793","9","0","1","22 November 2011"," A Great Addition to an Epic Phenomenon
","Okay, so after reading some of the reviews here, I have a couple of responses before getting to my review of the film. First of all, David Yates is a director, not a screenwriter. I'm sure he's included in the process, but people need to stop blaming him for the random things thrown into the movies (Bellatrix setting the Burrow on fire in Half-Blood Prince, for example). His job is to direct the actors, not write the screenplay. Leave him alone. Second of all, J.K. Rowling has been part of the process since they started making the films, and she's been happy with every adaptation. If it's good enough for her, it should be good enough for the rest of you since she wrote the whole series.<br/><br/>Now, to the film itself. Yates sets the tone very well, and it continues throughout the film, even though there were several light moments that took the focus temporarily off the darkness and tension in the film (Harry and Hermione dancing was adorable, even though everyone knows she is supposed to be with Ron). The scenery is incredible, I think that goes without saying. The actors in this film are top-notch and at their best--Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Jason Isaacs, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman--to say nothing about the main three. Daniel Radcliffe has had plenty of experience in this franchise playing vulnerable, scared, and angsty, but in this (and part 2, especially) we see him truly overcome fear and the possibility he could die. He definitely has his moments of vulnerability, fear, and angst, but he also has to deal with his faltering trust in Dumbledore, which happens to be my only critique of this film: it is not explored enough. Emma Watson has truly blossomed into a beautiful, talented actress. She deals with wiping her parents' memories, which was so difficult to watch, as well as Ron's departure and sudden return. Speaking of Ron, Rupert Grint gets to play something different: he really confronts his feelings for Hermione, and his insecurities about being the ""sidekick"" of the famous Harry Potter. Killing the Horcrux was a great way of symbolically tackling the insecurities and asserting his confidence. The scene where Hermione reads the story of the Three Brothers is stylistically speaking the most amazing thing I have ever seen on film. It was subtle but grim, and it was so so well done. And the scene with Bathilda Bagshot and the snake makes me scream and jump every time I watch it. It's effective but not too over the top.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a wonderful adaptation of the book. Well-worth seeing for anyone who believes themselves to be a Harry Potter fan."

","Writing this review is obviously extremely late in the game, but who cares! ""Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows Part I"" is without a doubt one of my favourite entries in the series. David Yates really gets a hold of the power, and darkness of the book and brings it out for us to see.<br/><br/>*PLEASE NOTE THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BOTH PARTS OF THE DEATHLY HALLOWS!*<br/><br/>Within the first few minutes, already we're getting a sense of dread as Harry watches his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley move out and leave him all alone. Ron watches the skies from The Burrow as black clouds cover the sky, and Hermione, well I had forgotten she mentioned it in the book, and thus it had me choking up, she erases her parents memory of her, and we get a a series of shots of family photos as Hermione fades away forever. <br/><br/>The film progressively gets much darker as The Order of The Phoenix arrives to take Harry to a safe house now that Lord Voldemort is aware of his location (No thanks to Severus Snape...but we'll get to that in Part II) and we witness the death of Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody and Harry's beloved owl Hedwig. <br/><br/>The film continues on with Harry, Ron and Hermione seeking out Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes which were explained in The Half-Blood Prince (Tom Riddle's Diary, Marvolo Gaunt's ring, the necklace, the Diadem of Ravenclaw, The cup of Hufflepuff, Nagini the snake and Harry himself)<br/><br/>However, it isn't until the last 10 minutes of the film where we feel the overwhelming power of darkness as audiences everywhere cried alongside Harry over the death of Dobby the House-Elf. Part I ends with Lord Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb and shooting a curse into the sky.<br/><br/>So, this is without a second doubt one of the best entries in the Harry Potter saga (Many people tend not to listen to me since my favourite is actually the Goblet of Fire) but trust me, both parts of the Deathly Hallows will not disappoint, and will end off the Harry Potter saga nicely."

Also, the movie had the most drama and intensity than the others had so far. This movie makes you waiting on what will happen next, and takes us back with some memorabilia, and it will give us reminders of the previous films, so we never lose sight with this spectacular series, and I hope all of this continues later in Part 2.

It just made me wonder, ""Where are they going to go now?!"". But then I remembered that it wasn't the end. I had to give it a 10/10. I didn't expect much of the movie. It is kind of like the movie Inception. It keeps you wondering. Every I watch it, my brain keeps on spinning with questions. The movie was completely amazing! I am SO going to see Deathly Hallows Part 2. The questions that run through my head are something like: are they just going to stay there? What is Voldemort going to do with his new wand? It is a must-see! The rating should really be WAY higher than 7.7/10. Amazing!!"
"mahadkhan99","10","0","2","13 July 2011"," The epic and amazing tale of Harry Potter will soon come to an end.
","I honestly just don't know what to say. Its all started in some coffee shop in the United Kingdom, and its going to end on the electronic billboards of Trafalger Square and big screens all over the world. Harry Potter has been with us as we grew up and now its going to end. Its kind of hard to believe. Whenever a new movie came out, everyone was pleased and excited to see the next one. 'There will always be a next one'. Nope. The reason we will all feel different in the cinema on July 15, is because this is the last one. I'm going to be honest, I have not known about Harry Potter as long as some other people have, but I know how they feel.<br/><br/>In my opinion (and most others' around the world) J.K. Rowling is a complete genius. I couldn't have come up with an idea like that even if i was given ten years. ""The idea simply just fell into my head"" she says. Well, that's kind of rare for a lot of people trying to come up with a good story. Because of that idea, she wrote seven books, became famous worldwide, and eventually became richer than the queen of England. Now that, is what I call a success.<br/><br/>These books always made me feel different no matter what mood I was in. Whenever I read the books, It made me feel all wondrous and awestruck. if I was in one mood or the other, the magical tale of Harry Potter always made me feel different.<br/><br/>The movies made me feel even better. What annoys me rather a lot, is how people say they are true Harry Potter fans, just because they have seen all of the movies. The movies make you look at the series differently than the books do, i'm afraid. Yes, Warner Bros. Has done very well transforming J.K. Rowling's amazing tale into motion pictures, but nothing beats the good old Harry Potter Book. If you ask me, you enjoy the movie a lot more if you have read the book. Seriously, depending on how the movie makers did it out as a motion picture according to the book, it may just ruin your day, or make your day. Maybe both!<br/><br/>Yes, the movies are amazing, but there is no doubt about this: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was the most amazing movie I have ever seen based on harry Potter. Warner Bros. should be proud of themselves. They really did it this time. Better than any other of the 6 movies. Soon to be 7.<br/><br/>A part of me wants the last movie to release tomorrow. A part of me wants it never to come.<br/><br/>When I sat in the theater, watching the Deathly Hallows Part 1, and I saw that Warner Bros. logo striding towards me, hearing the theme music playing, I really knew that that was the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>I have heard rumors that Rowling is planning on making an eighth book, but that wont matter to me. don't get me wrong, I will still read it, and I'll probably like it, but the truth is, J.K. Rowling was done her job as an author, and has brought happiness to readers all over the world. Her duty, is done.<br/><br/>An awesome, epic series like Harry Potter will last a long time, but unfortunately, everything every good series eventually comes to an end. We hope the world keeps this amazing tale alive, and we hope you always will be with us, in the magical world, of Harry Potter."

","After seeing every single film currently out right now, I can say this is one of the most interesting multiple movie based series I've ever seen. Based off a book, Harry Potter has created a classic epic film series.<br/><br/>I decided for my own personal reasons to not watch p1 Yesterday, however I have been looking forward to it since Saturday. What would happen? How would the characters interact this time? Would anything bad happen? All that I can say is I cannot wait for the final one! Part 2 is going to take years (For some)/many days of watching movies (me) put together and reveal the final outcome of all the hard work. How will it end? Only one way to find out.<br/><br/>In the meantime, this film contained scenes close to what I personally hoped would happen. The thee main characters are very close now. One of them leaves in a huff at one point. The two get very close. Loved the little 'dance' scene! Nice to see the other guy come back. Unfortunate to see that some more characters have had to die.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll rate this 8/10"
"IllusionOfLife","8","0","3","27 June 2011"," Somewhat Rushed, but Overall Good
","WARNING: Typically I keep my reviews spoiler free, but because I will be comparing the film with the book and because just about everyone has either read the book or knows what happens by other means there will be SPOILERS in this review. So for the five of you out there who are not familiar with the story leave now. <br/><br/>Alright, so as per usual, I re-read the book before seeing the film so that I could compare the two together and see each ones own strengths and weaknesses. And I will say there are some really good things about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The main trio have definitely matured as actors and really are wonderful in this movie; Deathly Hallows was perhaps the book that most deeply explored the relationship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione and I am happy to say that the strong relationship they had in the book was very well replicated on screen. For better or for worse the Harry Potter films have always had impeccable casting, and though there are few new characters, this film certainly is no exception. While reading the book again I realized just how much these actors have become the embodiment of the characters from Rowling's novels, and they are completely inseparable in my mind. The entire cast is excellent in this film, and anyone who dares remake these movies in the future will have an overwhelming challenge trying to find a cast as perfect as this. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't praise the pacing of this movie nearly as much. When re-reading the book this time, knowing the story would be broken into two parts I tried to imagine where the split would take place, and I decided that the most logical break would be after Ron returns, he and Harry retrieve Gryffindor's sword, and the two of them destroy the locket. If they had built it up it could have been a really powerful climax for the first half, it would have settled the conflict of Ron's departure before the split, and it fits neatly just about half way through the book. Several chapters further, there is the sequence in which Voldemort steals the Elder Wand from Dumbledore, and I knew that would make for an irresistible cliff-hanger, however, that happens about two thirds of the way through the story causing a slight problem. Unfortunately, the draw of a cliff-hanger ending proved too great and the story was split at the latter, meaning that in order to cover all of the many important bases in the first two thirds of the book, things had to be rushed. <br/><br/>There was nothing in particular that was left out that I thought damaged the movie in any way, but rather certain important character moments were not given the proper time or attention to really help emphasize the emotions and situations of these characters. For example, Hermione's emotion over Ron's departure felt slightly brushed over, and her anger at his return came and went in an instant. In a story like this where the development of characters is the single most important thing, I was disappointed that a lot of that development was rushed through in order to hit the major plot points leading up to the cliff- hanger. <br/><br/>On the bright side, though, there were some truly amazing moments in this film: the trip to Godric's Hollow, the opening scene showing Hermione altering her parents memory and the emotion reflected later in altering the Death Eater's, and the beautifully handled scene depicting Dobby's death and burial. <br/><br/>For those who claimed the two part film was nothing more than a cynical cash-grab for Warner Bros. this film should prove them wrong; if they had tried to fit the entirety of the Year 7 in one two-and-a-half hour film it would have been terrible. As it stands, though, Part 1 was a good movie despite being somewhat rushed. The silver lining of the split being where it is, is that they will have much more time to really pack the second part with all the emotion it requires. I'm looking forward, anxiously, to July when I'll be able to look at both parts as a whole. <br/><br/>Rating: B+"
"vrinalex","8","0","2","15 June 2011"," Where's the Magic?
","I saw this film on the first day it came out. As I was watching it, I was shocked to see how dark it was. At about a half-hour through, there was already two deaths. This is the darkest Harry Potter film in my opinion. My other problem was that there was not much magic and imagination in this one. I missed the quidditch matches and enchanted things. This film was all about traveling and hiding. I eventually got bored watching the trio travel from place to place, setting up a tent. Don't get me wrong, this is a great film (as all of the Harry Potter movies were). Despite the negative things about this movie, there were a lot of positive things as well. There was comedy and tons of action. And I love the little cliffhanger at the end. Overall, pretty good movie! Totally recommend it."
"ben-1118","7","0","2","6 June 2011"," True to the book
","I felt like this first part of the HP finale bears the same strengths and weaknesses as the book: A furious start (Harry's party leaving his home and being attacked by death eaters) followed by a quite drawn-out and repetitive stretch (Harry and his core crew err around and look for horcruxes aka magic tokens).<br/><br/>As in the book, the emotional conflicts between Harry, Hermione and especially Ron are not very deep or convincing. The obvious parallels with the Lord of the Rings (Ron and his locket vs. Frodo and the ring) are embarrassing, to say the least.<br/><br/>Still, in terms of mood and visual style the movie comes astonishingly close to what I had in mind when I read the book. Overall, good and faithful adaptation but no cigar."
"saurabh_dashora4091","9","0","3","3 June 2011"," Another Work of Pure Art
","**********MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***************<br/><br/>Something happened after GOF that has made the most-loved Harry Potter series into an exhibition of pure art. The coming of David Yates as the director was a huge blessing for this series that was probably dipping after the melodramatic climax of GOF. What Yates has accomplished is simply superb. His style of directing that was in earlier stages of testing in OOTP got refined in HBP. But here, in DH1 he has simply created an amazing masterpiece and also the best Harry Potter movie till date.<br/><br/>Although the earlier movies were a lot of fun and re-invented CGI effects in an all-new direction but the environment that Yates has created is the closest to the soul of the books. Apart from the first two Potter books, all the others had a dark brooding feel to them. Yates captured that feel to perfection.<br/><br/>He single-handedly transformed the series into a mature story of survival and friendship. In DH1 he is simply outstanding. What stands out about DH1 is the tension that is built up in the beginning and it is relentless till the end. As Harry, Ron and Hermione traverse the length and breadth of England in search of the Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort they are faced with choices and each choice has been described so vividly that makes you feel like you are making the choices as well. Add to that a painting like feel to the setting and you get a panoramic movie full of character development and some really cool CGI. <br/><br/>However, what stood out most is the portrayal of Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes was always the best (we know how sinister he could be as a villain courtesy Schindler's List) choice for the role. But somehow, his potential was never realized. For the first time, you feel his power. The way he addresses his servants in the opening of the movie-- that is probably one of the best scenes of the series. I hope they continue with the same kind of presentation for Voldemort in DH2 where he'll have virtually half the screen-time.<br/><br/>The young actors were good as usual. However, it can be said that Radcliffe has taken his skills to an all new level. He looks like an actor now. And the unexpected dance scene with Hermione was so awesome that even a huge Harry Potter fan would be amused by that. The whole new dimension was added to Harry and Hermione's friendship in this movie which was present in the books but the prior movies missed it completely. Other directors failed to realize that they weren't just classmates. They share a bond of love that is very different from being friends or lovers. This movie brought that side out and it was really satisfying to sit back and say that they got it right--finally.<br/><br/>All in all, it is must-watch for any HP fan. But for those who haven't read the books, a little back-story introduction can be enough for them to enjoy this movie from an individual stand point. After all, apart from all the blended stories, it is still the final showdown between good and evil. 10 POINTS for DH1."

The production values are first rate and the 3 main lead actors have really matured.<br/><br/>To be honest I have never read the books(I'm a little to old to be reading Harry Potter) and I've only seen the first film in the franchise.

","I've been a fan of the Harry Potter series since I first saw the very first movie in the cinemas. I've loved every single movie, some more than others. I went to the cinema with high expectations, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>This movie has impressed me with the stunning effects, the great acting, the amazing dialog, the emotions, everything. I think they've really managed to catch the feel of hopelessness in this movie, and I'm really happy about that.<br/><br/>During this movie I laughed, cried, jumped in shock and sat on the edge of my seat. It's absolutely fantastic, and I cannot stress that enough.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this being watched by everyone who has a bit of magic at their hearts, but of course watch the other 7 movies first!"
"mattwood-shorty","7","0","2","9 May 2011"," A good film, with good qualities.
","At the beginning, we see the Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), setting a grave mood which continues throughout the film (not continuously). <br/><br/>However, this grimness didn't seem to continue throughout the whole film, which I was disappointed about. This, I found, was when Ron (Rupert Grint) left Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and Hermione (Emma Watson) in the first half of the film. Ron was always the grimmest of the trio, with the help of his trusty radio, which always set the mood on edge. Once Ron left, it lost most of the grave mood, which I found disappointing. <br/><br/>The film, as a whole is good, but I found it dragged on a bit. I found that the cause of this was the highly exciting, amazing action scene at the beginning (where they get Harry to the Burrows). I found this scene the most exciting scene of the entire film and with it being so fast paced, you expect the other action scene's to be equally, if not more exciting. <br/><br/>I found that this wasn't the case. The other action scenes were good, the only one equal to the first action sequence was the fight between Harry and Nagini. The action sequence that I thought lacked luster was the foot-chase through the woods. The problem with this scene is that the trio had always managed to fight off a fair few Death Eaters at once, but as soon as confronted with 5(?) snatchers, turn tail and run. I would have liked this scene to have a bigger fight, instead of an occasional spell going off here and there and with no real fight happening. It had potential to be another exciting scene, but it fell short. <br/><br/>The scene's between the action gave us a sense of being alone and the times being full with stress between the characters. The trio often don't talk or when they do, they argue. This brings a sense of tension between them and heightens the feeling that they are alone.<br/><br/>I found three, truly emotional scenes in the film (not just filled with stress and tension). The first of these was when Harry and Hermione arrived in Godric's Hollow. They pair realise that its Christmas Eve, which is always the time for family and friends, but they have no one. And also, we see the grave of Lily and James Potter, Harry's parents. You can see that Harry is upset to finally see the grave of his parents, and Hermione shows that she feels sorry for him. The second one, was where Ron returned. This scene is emotional because it renews Harry and Ron's friendship and trust in each other, and also it is the scene of the destruction of the Horcrux, which tempts Ron into killing Harry. Finally, the third one is when Dobby (Tony Jones) is killed. The final words from Dobby are, ""Such a beautiful place it is, to be with friends. Dobby is happy to be with his friend, Harry Potter"". This shows us that there is hope and friendship in the world, even as there is death and sadness, a truly powerful scene, in my opinion, the most powerful in the film. <br/><br/>A final note: a good film that followed the book closely. But it dragged sometimes with extended scenes with no dialogue and no excitement, although I understand the reason for them. The film, I felt, lacked in the excitement department. Especially after the two excellent action scenes in the first half of the film (chase to the Burrows, the fight with Nagini) and they raised my expectations of the other action scenes, which failed to deliver. On the other hand, they succeeded spectacularly on the emotional side of the film, living up to my expectations, and going beyond it since David Yates managed to keep the feeling going during the duration of the film."
"gavin6942","8","0","2","4 May 2011"," Coming To a Huge Finale...
","As Harry races against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, he uncovers the existence of three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>I think this film was strong and David Yates did a great job with it, perhaps even better than Guillermo del Toro would have. The return of Dobby is awesome (he is now my favorite character) and the torture scene with Hermione is epic (although cut for the film, I hope to see an extending version some day).<br/><br/>The plot is really coming together now, and while there are some things that are not completely clear (I did not read the books), I think I am ready for the final installment."
"marspeach","9","0","3","27 April 2011"," Best Yet
","The acting was outstanding. I've always felt Rupert Grint as Ron was the most natural of the trio but up until now he hasn't had much to work with, usually stuck as comic relief. Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was really good. I particularly loved Obliviated in the beginning because it caught my attention right away and Farewell to Dobby because it was so beautiful and moving. The cinematography was also excellent. I wasn't fond of the camping scenes in the book but I didn't mind them in the movie because of the gorgeous location shots! Nearly all of the individual scenes were well-done, with a perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. My favorites were Hermione erasing her parents' memories and the silver doe. I was confused about the Harry/Hermione dance scene because I felt it was a bit out of character for Harry, but it was actually pretty cute.<br/><br/>The film wasn't perfect. My two biggest complaints were the lack of explanation for the mirror shard and no use of the invisibility cloak. Since the cloak is one of the Hallows, wouldn't it have made sense to remind the non-hardcore audience about it? Similarly, those who haven't read the books will be scratching their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard.I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity. Hers and Harry's romance was poorly treated in HBP as well and I was disappointed that it was more of the same this time.<br/><br/>My other complaints are really minor quibbles in comparison. I missed seeing Dudley and Harry's handshake, even though the movie works perfectly fine without it. I would have liked to see Harry and Ron hug after the destruction of the locket and have Harry assure Ron that he only sees Hermione as a sister (especially since some viewers thought he was trying to come on to Hermione in the dance scene!). I also felt Malfoy Manor, while a nice scene in itself, paled in comparison to the book. It was slightly rushed and watered down- namely Ron's reaction and Wormtail's fate. I suppose this was done for a reason, and it does work in the movie- but the book scene was so much better.<br/><br/>The end only made me want Part II right now! I guess I'll have to reread the book to satisfy myself until July."

","Harry Potter has come a long way. From the age of 12 learning the art of magic and wizardry, defeating many villains and successfully battling grave dangers and enemies he is now a 17 year old lad. Same goes to his lifelong buddies Ron Weasley and Harmoine Granger. These 3 friends are now the center of attention of many and Harry is yet to face the greatest challenges of his life while his allies fall in numbers and the whole game starts to become his burden. More enemies heading towards him and keeping the balance of the known world and the threats against it becomes the prime objective of this young guy with specs and gift of magic. Knowing he is the chosen one put more and more pressure on him and his enemies the same while trying to achieve their own ambitions vigorously.<br/><br/>I'm not a hardcore fan of Harry Potter as I'm with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars for that matter. But one good reason I still spend over two and a half hours with this movie each time it comes out, from its 1st to the latest 7th chapter 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚ÄìPart1' is it's profoundly fantastic space it gives for wildest imaginations and fantasies. Growing up and becoming an adult is not a reason for anyone to lose the grip over this wonderful series of movies. If you like movies and if you like to give yourself a break from all known hazards of your natural life and embed your heart and soul in to something magical, then Harry Potter must be the place to invest your dime.<br/><br/>I have no intention of going deeply in to the plot of this chapter or describe the characters in detail as this movie has come a very long way by now. All of you who want to watch it I'm quite sure that will do without taking a second thought as it's in your dreams already. Basically Voldermort is becoming powerful day by day and he is working towards his ultimate target of killing Harry Potter. And Harry and his 2 buddies are on the epic effort in order to find the Horcruxes and to destroy them before the dark lord finds them and use it for his advantage. The plot grows bigger and bigger and seemly not in favor of Harry which is clearly creating the grand finale in next chapter.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚ÄìPart1' is another wonderful chapter of this brilliant series of movies. This maybe the most successful movie franchise in the history of movies ever other than Star Wars. So I really don't need to make your mind in order to watch this.

"eric-35-638140","8","0","4","23 April 2011"," Coming to an exciting close!
","After a long journey in both book and film format the Harry Potter saga is finally coming to a close. The millions of fans around the world will already know the outcome of the story due to reading the book when it was first published back in 2007. However seeing a film-maker's interpretation of the books is a whole new experience, and in Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part One they will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>All the cast regulars return for this penultimate film in the series, as they will for the very last film, Part Two. Due to the huge scope of the story in the final book the film was split into two separate parts. In this film we get to see Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Rupert Grint as Ron, and Emma Watson as Hermione on a mission to defeat Lord Voldemort by seeking out and destroying the horcruxes which make him immortal.<br/><br/>There is an ominous feel to this film and a very real sense that we are heading for a final climactic showdown between Harry and Voldemort. Indeed, the Dark Lord has taken measures to prevent this occurrence by dispatching the Death Eaters to capture Harry. He has also taken control of Hogwarts and the Ministry Of Magic, meaning that in this film our trio of heroes do not have the support from others which they have enjoyed in previous adventures. Therefore they have to rely on each other and work as a team much more than ever before.<br/><br/>Despite not having as large a part to play in this film, The Deathly Hallows still features performances from many well respected British actors. Robbie Coltrane returns as Hagrid, along with Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, John Hurt, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and of course Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that this is the darkest Harry Potter film yet both in terms of content and the way in which it is shot by director David Yates. The strain of the foreboding situation even tells on the friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they try to escape from the Death Eaters that are hunting them. This is without a doubt the most grown up Harry Potter film to date.<br/><br/>As with all the films in the Harry Potter franchise, the big action sequences in The Deathly Hallows are exciting and visually stunning. They are more sinister in tone than normal to tie in with the general feel of the movie, and younger viewers may even be frightened by some of the imagery. They are handled absolutely correctly however to replicate the feel of the book, and to keep the audience entertained.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it would be impossible to include everything from a Harry Potter book in the film version, the Deathly Hallows is a very faithful adaptation. Fans of the book will not be disappointed in the attention to detail shown here, and in fact Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part One is sure to leave everybody looking forward to Part Two and the completion of this much loved, record breaking series."
"drachirloyah","8","0","2","21 April 2011"," Dark, harrowing, intense and this is only the first half!
","The problem with adapting a book like the Deathly Hallow, the final story in an incredibly rich fantasy saga, is that after 7 films and with so many characters and elements introduced, it's near impossible to bring it all together for one final satisfying film. Indeed the flaw of the films as a whole is that they've inevitably lacked the same depth as the source material and the filmmakers have at times rather neglected non-readers of the book by failing to explain certain things, something that is perhaps more apparent under Yates' direction. As a film however, Part 1 is a very good attempt and possesses as much magic and charm as the series has always had whilst trying to be something uniquely different. Director David Yates has been perhaps unfairly criticised in the last film for focusing so much on the characters instead of paying attention to specific details in the plot (contradictory I know) but here in Part 1, Yates finally seems to have struck that balance.<br/><br/>Inevitably the final book was always going to be a spectacle filled event with incredible set pieces and series defining moments and for the most part Yates hits all the right notes and delivers a movie that devoted fans should be impressed with. Particular highlights include a Polyjuice Potion filled excursion into the Death Eater controlled Ministry, a snake fight in Godric's Hollow, Battle of Souls with a Horcrux and imprisonment, torture and escape from Malfoy Manor. Whilst the set pieces generally thrill what is never substituted or forgotten is the characters, especially in the extended roaming segments of the story where the film relies solely on its three leads. They've captivated us for the last ten years and here they are never better with genuine chemistry and great performances. All three of them have their stand out moments in the prelude to the finale and it's great we get to spend some time with them before all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>There are a few missteps however; pacing is all over the place in the earlier segments and as a consequence the opening Sky Attack set piece doesn't deliver what it should. The sequence feels a little indulgent creatively and the scene feels terribly rushed and therefore what should be a tense and thrilling sequence ends up being rather flat and unsatisfying. As with Phoenix and Prince, Yates shows confidence in handling special effects and his films have established a consistent tone and style that brings Potter to life with utmost conviction but what he lacks is a sense of importance to the smaller details. A bold and wise move to those familiar to the novel but for others the glossing over of specific details in the story doesn't necessarily make sense to those unfamiliar with the novels; for instance a shard of broken glass with a strange eye looking and the nature of the twin cores of Harry and Voldemort's wand. There are some elements that have been neglected somewhat but the overall problem that Part 1 has is that it is only the first part of a larger movie. With the epic final showdown expected in Part 2, Part 1 acts merely as the prelude and whilst it does well to set up the final conflict, as a movie experience it isn't either as conclusive or as satisfying as a complete picture.<br/><br/>However taking the unique structure and the first part element away from the proceedings, Deathly Hallows is the most harrowing and intense Potter film so far. Yates somehow manages to succeed (as in his previous two movies) in creating this tense, eerie, and dark atmosphere that makes this world seem completely different than before. The danger feels constant throughout and some of the themes are sadly familiar; 'Magic is Might', the Muggle-Born Registration Committee, the faceless names given out by the chilling radio broadcast of the newest victims of the Death Eater regime. It's not short of humour either because there are a welcome number of laughs to help balances things out contrasted with scenes of intense sadness that Yates executes with gut-wrenching perfection.<br/><br/>It's not a complete movie but in terms of a first half; it's one hell of a good first part that will leave all Potterites gagging for the epic finale in Part 2"
"em_dem60","10","0","2","18 April 2011"," Such a great movie
","I can honestly say this movie is just fantastic. If finally hits you how much Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown up, and how their acting has developed tremendously. The beginning brings back the memories of the three normal little kids who, ten years ago, set out to become wizards and a witch. <br/><br/>The enormity of what their task is does hit them at times throughout the story, and it almost breaks the trio up. But they pull through, always fighting, always getting stronger.<br/><br/>The story has also become a lot darker- yes, we knew something as dark and dangerous as this would someday come, but now it's finally arrived. They are constantly in danger, constantly being watched.<br/><br/>The great thing is that there is some comedy. Of course, the famous and popular house elf Dobby returns, along with Kreacher (who isn't as funny obviously, but still, how great these little creatures are). The romance also offers a light-heartedness to the film, which at certain points is much needed. We don't get to see much development of the Harry/Ginny relationship, but a huge leap is made to the possible relationship of Ron and Hermione.<br/><br/>I thought this film was truly brilliant. A huge congratulations to the cast and crew, and of course, David Yates, the wonderful director. A great triumph once again."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1<br/><br/>While most teen mages are binge drinking potions and experimenting with hex, the sophomoric sorcerer in this fantasy film is more concerned with retrieving magical trinkets.<br/><br/>With Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his cronies (Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Tom Felton) on their trail, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) embark on a quest for Voldemort's fragmented soul.<br/><br/>En route, they unearth a fairy tale that speaks to three enchanted items that could turn the tide in their battle against evil: the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility.<br/><br/>The first half of the seventh and final installment of the Harry Potter franchise, Deathly Hallows is the most rewarding: the pacing is precipitate, the action is amplified and the relationships are thrown through the wringer.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, conjuring up a sequel inside of an existing sequel is the mischievous handiwork of marketing witchcraft.

","Harry Potter is in some trouble, his headmaster has been killed, by Snape of all people and the dark lord's powers seem to be rising. Harry must find and destroy as many Horcruxes as he can find, in his journey he learns about the Deathly Hallows. <br/><br/>This entry is probably the best in the series since Prisoner of Azkaban. David Yates, who has helmed two previous installments in the franchise (arguably some of the weaker films) has finally seemed to find his footing with the first part of the last installment. Deathly Hallows is exciting, heartfelt and continues the story at a brisk pace, setting the viewer up for wanting more and ending the film on a good note. <br/><br/>The thing that helps the film most is how much crap has hit the fan. The story has finally moved past the years at Hogwarts routine and has set in motion the final battle that people have been eagerly anticipating. The biggest gripe about the films from the 4th book on, would be that they leave out too much. It's understandable, since the books get bigger and bigger. Splitting the finale into two parts was a good idea, both from a business standpoint and a filmmaking standpoint. It gives the audience more time with Harry and the filmmakers more time to tell the complete story. <br/><br/>I read the first book, it was good. It was gift, but I never actively went out to get the others, so my views on the films are from a film standpoint alone. Deathly Hallows managed to suck me into the world more so than others. No longer are we waiting for our heroes to learn magic spells, they are taking on the bad guys head on. I guess it's true for most series, the darkest is usually the best. Deathly Hallows is probably the darkest Harry Potter film yet because not everyone makes it out alive. <br/><br/>That would be a gripe I have though, a lot of the death scenes are only mentioned or give a brief second on screen. We are with characters we've known from films as far back as the beginning, so I would have liked a little bit more reflection on certain death scenes. Harry has lost his mentor. He must grow up and make decisions for himself, become more of a leader. <br/><br/>The amount of time, care and love put into crafting these films are clearly evident. One only has to look at the recent rushed attempts of the Twilight series to see that the studio and filmmakers are more keen on cashing in on the craze then adapting a story to screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone came out ten years ago. This is a franchise that, despite the books not being completed yet, wants to tell an epic story. It took the books ten years to tell the story, so it takes the films ten as well. Deathly Hallows is a great beginning to the end."

","the film is loyal to the book without being boring. It has the right atmosphere - very dark, much tension, but there are enough funny moments to change the mood in the right time. Visual effects are stunning as they should be, wouldn't expect anything less than that. as a huge H.P fan, I'd say the film is highly recommendable.<br/><br/>the decision to cut the film to two was smart, since the length of the book makes it impossible to make a movie that will be both loyal to the text and won't last a day or cut out important moments like in the fourth part (Goblet of Fire), which was truly a shame, as it's the most spectacular book of them all. The film ended just in the right moment to leave me with a taste for more!"

","Being a Potter fan since childhood, I'm not exactly looking forward to seeing it end, but would still not have missed this for the world. At the same time, I do not let my love for the franchise affect by judgement of the film.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' is by far my least favourite book in the series. It's the only one I actually disliked having loved every instalment before (especially Goblet of Fire). The book dragged on for far too long, and the ending was predictable and dry. Fortunately, the film put some punch into the first half of the story, creating a tense and emotional adventure.<br/><br/>This film is by far the darkest in the series, which I felt suited the story very well. It begins with the characters in a clearly hopeless situation, and ends with even less chance of success. The beginning was powerful, with a heartbreaking scene of Hermione being forced to erase herself from her parents' life, and a brilliantly chilling scene involving Voldemort and his followers. The cinematography is very advanced, and the series has come a long way since it began. I felt it was a beautifully made film, and if they had gotten every element right, the potential to have been the best in the series.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Daniel Radcliffe has improved greatly (never been a big fan), but his acting still felt wooden and too different to the character of Harry in the book. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson played their characters perfectly, and the chemistry between them is a joy to watch. There was absolutely NO bad acting here. The performance that stood out the most for me was Ralph Fiennes chilling portrayal of Voldemort. He completely out-did himself in this film, creating a villain actually superior to the one written in the book.<br/><br/>But, the pacing of the film was fairly poor. The first half-an-hour was perfect, but the film felt very unstable after that. A problem I had with the book (the camping sections) were toned down in the film, but still a problem. Until the ending of the film, the characters really had no idea what they were doing, and most of their successes were from sheer luck. There was a beginning, but the middle and end did not seen to exist. I appreciate this is Part 1, but the lack of completion is a hit to the movie. I was not particularly overwhelmed by the film either, despite the fact that this is the finale.<br/><br/>But there was plenty I loved. The scene in the ministry of magic was very funny and entertaining, the few scenes involving Voldemort and the Death Eaters were chilling, the acting was excellent, and the action sequences and CGI were well-done.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows Part Two arrives in Cinemas summer 2011, and I have faith it will improve on the pace and quality of this decent but slow beginning."

","Having read the beloved series, I was expecting loads from this film. I was O.K with the series so far; just not liking the structures of the 2nd and 6th. The 6th was a major disappointment and I REALLY wanted something much better. This film is what I got as a spectacular result.<br/><br/>'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is a sophisticated cinematic experience as well as boasting. Featuring great performances, joyous thrills, and dazzling effects; it also remains known as (for me) the darkest and best out of them all. Wow, what an adaptation...<br/><br/>Making this film well worth the watch are notably well-orchestrated performances. From little 12-year old's to mature 17 year old's is a huge transition. Yet, its very well performed. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint; give performances that seem to show their hidden talents. Radcliffe is good, but still better than what I saw of him in the last 6 movies. He is charming, reluctant, and efficient. Grint is also the same; adding nostalgic humorous moments throughout the film; as well as maturity ones. Watson is great; having improved the same as the other two.<br/><br/>The thrills throughout this film are unbelievably appraisal. The 'jump-out-of-your-seat' scares are VERY well-done. Making them even better are the dazzling effects and visuals. So, beautifully filmed and pretty scary! Overall, this is the best 'Potter' you'll see yet, mainly because of more maturity and darkness than the other ones. It's a thrilling ride that's well acted and genuinely directed. A perfect example of a great book adaptation. Man...I just can't wait for Part 2!"
"Meven_Stoffat","10","0","1","11 March 2011"," Exactly how it should be: sexy, gritty, dark and fun
","I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire! <br/><br/>Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the ""TWO movies? [...] that"" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.<br/><br/>Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.<br/><br/>Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.<br/><br/>In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!"

Me and my mum went to see this on the Wednesday after it came out. We just managed to get the last tickets. Before the film began we were really quite curious about when they stop the film for Part 2. We were also talking about going to Part 2 in July.<br/><br/>They film began, immediately an emotional scene arose that showed the three main people about to set out on their long journey to find these Horcuxes. As we were watching mum did point out a couple of instances that were cut out. But there was only like three or four moments she did that.<br/><br/>When Dobby dies I couldn't help but scream ""NOOOOO!"" at the top of my lungs. I was then expecting the film to end when it faded to black, but no wait.....wait for it..... Voldemort is there. He's going into Dumbeldore's tomb.<br/><br/>(Seriously designers why doe's Dumbeldore have a really crap tomb design?) Voldy takes Dumbeldore's wand and casts a spell up into the sky. Then........

","Bill Nighy is a perfect introductory character. He's the perfect vampire, although they could have touched his factions more like described in the book. Really prepares you for what is about to burst in.<br/><br/>The plot of the book is reproduced 80/20 leading the 20 to be more creative regarding what is to happen. Some things not included would have shown how JK Rowling conceived the true Harry Potter not as a kid but as a mature man now aware of his destiny. And its great to see our favorite trio of wizards now truly in a fight. Liked the action, liked the romance, but did not like the character deaths. <br/><br/>I would recommend that the other movies be watched before you even consider watching this one. Information is knowledge and this is a perfect preparation so that you're not confused or out of touch.<br/><br/>Finally, I must recommend the book to be fully, completely and finally read. This is because you're likely to expect more changes to the other film yet to come. As if this wasn't enough for the book fans."

","I was at my friends place one day back in 2000. His girl friend now wife was reading was reading a book and I asked what it was. She said it was harry potter. I was like whom? She had this amazed look like you don't know who harry is. Needles to say I was talked into going to see what all the fuss is about with this harry kid. Let's just say I was hooked when I left the theater. The deathly hallow didn't disappoint in this action adventure fantasy with Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and his friends, Hermione Jean Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Wesley (Rupert Grint).<br/><br/>The deathly hallows picks up with adventure of harry and his friends trying to finish professor Dumbledore's work with conquering the evil dark lord voldemort's.They are in search of the Gacrux's special amulets that can drain the dark lord of his power and destroy him. The kid's receive items that were left for them by professor Dumbledore,and went on a journey with these items to find the horcruxes.<br/><br/>In their travel's to find the horcruxes they discover clues hidden in the items they were left to them by professor Dumbledore's will. They did manage to add some funny scenes they have this potion that they can change into anyone they want they just have to take a piece of that persons hair. When they were attack at a wedding they had to take off.<br/><br/>When they took off they ended up in England. Hermione had this little purse; it looked like 12 inches by 12 inches. Hermione would pull out a change clothes for all 3 of them, and when they were in the wilderness she pulled out 6 or 12 mantent. Throughout their travels they keep running into people the dark lord voldemort's sent to capture them.It makes for some exciting scenes in their quest to conquer the dark lord.Like how they bring together the cast from the other films to tie everything tighter. Ralph fines looks very comfortable in his role as the evil (dark lord voldemort)<br/><br/>I enjoyed the use of the special effects from the evil wizards changing to the kid drinking a potion to change how they look. The talk about a familiar face dying happens in this chapter hmmm..lol.I left the movie saying I can't wait til the final chapter. I give Harry potter 3 stars. <br/><br/>Would I go Yes"

","I have to say that I was quite disappointed with The Half Blood Prince. I expected it to be much darker and it failed to succeed with that effort. Up until it's release, all I remember hearing was how dark and ominous The Half Blood Prince was going to be; that it was taking the series to a whole new level. <br/><br/>Now I have to be honest in saying that I was never much of a Harry Potter fan to being with. I had and still have not read the books and it wasn't until last year that I felt inclined to buy a DVD and watch some of them. <br/><br/>For me, i like to be entertained with visual effects and action. I like something fast paced and fun. It's good to have great characters like Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange and great actors to play them. I just hope that this as the series is coming to an end, justice is done for the fans. I speak to this point more so on behalf of the die hard fans than myself. But they still owe it to the fans to end on a high note."

","I was disappointed by this movie on first viewing, I'm not sure why. One of those little things bothered me that I couldn't quite put my finger on. However on second viewing I absolutely loved it. I loved how: it started off with Hermione instead of Harry for once, your eyes were drawn more to Rupert Grint than anyone else (or at least mine were, his brooding was quite eye-catching), Ron and Hermione's relationship is gradually building itself up, the 3 brothers story was animated, Harry danced with Hermione (not in the book as far as I remember but a brilliant touch all the same), Dobby's shoes were awesome and it ends with a huge cliffhanger. The only problem with it was it missed out the ghoul in the attic that Ron said was his replacement in the book whilst he was off with Harry and Hermione (when it shows him looking grumpy and staring into the distance at the start after Hermione's opening it could've shown him sorting out the ghoul or at least mentioned it so it seemed like he was contributing the group effort. Or something!) and it also missed out a crucial line from the book which would've been very useful at the time after he destroyed the locket. Harry said: ""She's always been like a sister to me, I thought you knew."" or something along those lines.<br/><br/>Overall the film captured the grimness of the book (with virtually everyone dying apart from the main characters) yet through in a laugh every now and then. IT WAS OZZUM!"

Everyone has heard the story of the boy you lived I'm sure everyone wants to know how, after ten long years the story will come to a close.<br/><br/>Personally I loved it! There are a couple bones i have to pick with Deathly Hallows Part 1. First, the movie was a bit too slow & dragged, it did make it a little boring. They could've cut down on all the camp sites, not all were crucial to the story. Second, it was not as sad as I expected it to make me feel. When i read the book the deaths of Hedwig & Dobby made me feel really sad, but when i saw their deaths in the movie it all happened so quickly it didn't give me time to be sad. Other than that the movie fantastic! The best is how the Hermione & Ron romance starts to happen. They're adorable! This movie has everything, great story, emotion and it starts to tie up all the loose ends."

","I have read all the books, own all the games, and own all the movies and watch them all the time. This one is easily my favorite! The only one that follows the book better is the first one and thats the only because it is short and has the least amount of important details. This one includes everything you need to know, and they end it at a great part. some people don't like where it ended but I love it because it leaves you thinking. The only part i don't like is the way they portrayed Dobby dropping down the chandelier at Malfoy Manner. in the book he uses magic to to do it, but in the movie he unscrews it and it just makes it weird after reading the book like 21 times one way and then seeing the movie another way. But over all its a great movie and I really recommend it."
"shaunpiersonx","9","0","1","17 January 2011"," The best Potter film yet, but it is only an appetizer, prompting us for the main course.
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, is the third Potter film to be helmed by director David Yates. Since Yate's catastophe he called, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" got bad reviews, he kicked it up a notch, directing beautifully in, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". This time, in Deathly Hallows, he kicks it up about 12 notches. Beautifully filmed, this Potter film is without question, the best. The film really is brilliantly acted as well, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint really give it their all in this sometimes emotional and dreary entry. Radcliffe is still mediocre though, and we can't help but feel that his acting is kind of weak at points. But Helena Bonham Carter's over-the-top Bellatrix counteracts that weakness, even though she is in the film for only a small period of time. Alan Rickman as Snape, is barley even there in this film. We see him once in the film's killer opening sequence, but then he vanishes.<br/><br/>In this Potter installment, Harry and friends must destroy the evil Lord Voldemort once and for all. They set out on a dangeous and life threatening mission to find Horcruxes, each an object where Voldemort had split his soul and hid. If you are a Potter virgin, please do not go see this film. You wil be baffled by the countless names and places included in the story.<br/><br/>Gorgeously lensed by the magnificent cinematographer, Eduardo Serra, this film is a lot more sullen and more bleak than the others, which is very apparent considering the material worked with. It seems less magical and more real life. The early technicolor palet that chris Columbus often used is a farewell to us. This is the prelude to the last Potter finale, which will be in theaters July of 2011, so it does feel unfinished. But that is the adventure in the Potter films. You never know what your gonna get."
"anifanmc","9","0","1","14 January 2011"," Immensely good start to a two-parter
","It's sort of unfair to have to do a review to the Part 1 of a movie since there were a lot of plot threads left hanging (as intended) but for the most part, it stands on its own as a fairly decent film. It's probably one of the most faithful in terms of adaptation to the novel (with a few extra scenes added in for emotional and dramatic effect), which has the dual effect of being very good for the fans but not necessarily the most coherent for people who haven't read the books. That's why I gave it a 9 out of 10 for the most part.<br/><br/>The movie starts off on a strong note, more or less where the novel began (with a short, rather shocking prologue where Hermione wipes her parents' memories to protect them) at Malfoy Manor, where Voldemort discusses how he wants to kill Harry Potter, and so on and so forth. For the next thirty minutes or so it follows almost *exactly* from the novel in terms of events progression (though they cut out a few relatively disposable characters like Tonks' parents). There's a fantastic aerial battle over the skies of England (and oddly on the streets as well, apparently us nonmagical people don't notice anything), with the aftershock and the reading of Dumbledore's will, etc, etc.<br/><br/>Then this is where the movie REALLY begins - the Ministry is taken over by the Death Eaters, Voldemort's faction, and they start a manhunt for Harry and his friends, and begin to round up ""undesirables"" in what is basically a campaign of genocide. This is an eerie depiction for Harry Potter novel fans and a chilling one for those who have read stories of the Nazis, Stalinists, etc. as they realize just how evil Voldemort's plans really are. I was a little amused to see they played the trope straight and installed a cadre of blackshirts in the new Ministry of Magic, ready to carry out their shadow Fuhrer's orders.<br/><br/>There's a lot of complaints about the second half of the movie, which slows down considerably, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione getting lost in the woods as they are forced to run and hide in any way they can but without any sort of real plan of action - and this definitely induced some ennui. Even I was forced, at times, to push myself to keep watching the scenes with the understanding that it's going to get crazier and crazier.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a few things aren't handled properly; Firstly, the whole subplot about Dumbledore's childhood and past, and his relationship with Grindelwald is sort of rushed and mangled as though they had saved it up for an ""extended version"". I doubt most of the viewers who haven't read the books know who the heck Grindelwald is (basically the magical equivalent of the German Fuhrer during the Second World War) and how he figures so importantly into the plot; I'm HOPING they make that more clear in the second movie. The other thing that wasn't properly explored was the concept of the Deathly Hallows (again something I'm sure they'll give more time to in the second film), since they sort of went from having it explained to them to being bombarded by Death Eater explosives and then going on a chase through the woods and then holycrapthemovieisalmostover.<br/><br/>Anyway... remaining cautiously optimistic for the finale, I'm sure it'll be fun, but hopefully it makes clear some of the weaker points of this film."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is seriously an epic movie.<br/><br/>I grew up reading the books and actually read the first book when I was in the fifth grade. I have probably read each book about fifty times and I expect a lot when I go see the movies. This totally surpassed everything I hoped for, for the following reasons: <br/><br/>1. The actors have really grown up and grown into their characters. I couldn't imagine anyone else as Harry, Ron or Hermione. In this film, they have matured greatly and it really shows on screen.<br/><br/>2. The movie actually follows the book. Now, granted, if you haven't read the Harry Potter books or at least watched the other six movies you probably won't understand what is truly going on in the movie so I would recommend doing that first. The movie does follow the book very closely, though. After I watched it, I was able to look in the contents and find the EXACT chapter where they cut it off. Nice.<br/><br/>3. Massive cliffhanger. I mean, we HP fans really know what happens but the fact that we are seeing it on film is even more amazing. I can NOT wait until July when I can see the rest of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows played out.<br/><br/>While I am a little biased because I'm such a huge fan of the books, I will say that this movie deserves a 10/10.

"enemems","8","0","1","31 December 2010"," The Best of Yates Adaptation... so far.
","First of all when I watched Yates' other two movies of HP (Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince) I thought they were great because of the cinematography, effects and other stuff. Then I realized the story was left out. Most teenagers who read the books (including me) hated the two films especially Order of the Phoenix because it's like the thickest book but has the thinnest interpretation in the movie. The book itself is the story why do they have to leave things out? <br/><br/>Getting back to the point... ""So Far"" Deathly hallows is the most loyal movie to the book but I'm not saying that it has every detail of the book (they left things like the ""ghoul in pajamas"" and Lupin's argument with Harry etc..). What I'm saying is, for the first time I saw the true beauty and magic of the book and this was it the Deathly Hallows and I didn't regret watching this. <br/><br/>Yeah I know MOST of the viewers of the movie falls asleep or leaves the cinema too early but you should know that the story is really like THAT. Try reading the book (half of it for part 1) and you will see as if every chapter they're ""camping"" and NO SCHOOL is seen. SO for this movie don't expect a LOT of fun (there are some funny moments but are short.) and dancing and teaching of spells or ghosts. This story is already mature and I don't think it's advisable to watch this with your kids anymore (6-10). This movie is all about ""EMOTION and SADNESS, PAIN, and HOPELESSNESS"" but it is portrayed in a great way.<br/><br/>I would also like to commend the ""Deathly Hallows story telling scene"" it's really artistic and creative, this alone can be the trailer of the movie. Well I hope you find my movie review helpful. For those who haven't watched it... Watch it in the cinemas NOW or you can wait for the DVD. <br/><br/>I give this movie a rating of 8/10"

He needs it.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to begin to explain the plot in this latest installment, part 1 of 2, that the seventh and final book has been stretched over. The film is enjoyable, with some great sequences, lashings of special effects all of which look great on the big screen, a stellar cast of Britain's acting elite and hints of comedy and romance as Harry Potter and pals battle on towards what we can only expect will be an epic showdown with Voldermort.<br/><br/>I read the first four books, but lost interest and haven't ventured further, but I have seen all the films (although I can't remember all of them enough to rate here) and whilst my interest isn't exactly enormous, I feel duty bound to see them through to the end, after all I've come this far. For true fans this will be enough to excite just as much as previous films and no doubt frustrate that it's been split into two with most having to wait until June 2011 for the final installment. For me, with my mild level of interest there is a lot to enjoy, but because I'm not a huge fan I struggled at times trying to keep up with it all, who's who, what everything means, not that it's excessive difficult to understand. My other issue is that the film is just so long, at two and half hours it pushes my limits for watching a film, so goodness knows how younger fans cope. . Still, that aside the film looks wonderful and there is something er, magical about taking a ride with Harry Potter et al. The rich imagination of J.K. Rowling is vividly brought to life with multiply Harry Potters in one scene to people flushing themselves down the loo to get to the ministry. It's for the most part all good fun, a little darker now as the story reaches it's climax, but overall it keeps as the saying goes the magic alive.<br/><br/>More review at my site: iheartfilms.weebly.com"

","When I first discovered that they planned to split the final book into two full movies, I was pleased. While I understand the necessity of selectively editing the content of a book when it is adapted to the big screen, I was very disappointed in what the production team decided to leave out of some of the movies...particularly the last three. The decision to essentially make ""Deathly Hallows"" a 5+ hour movie split into two parts gave Me the hope that they would start the finale with Dumbledore's funeral and restore some of the elements previously dropped. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This scene set near the end of ""Order of the Phoenix"" was a pivotal scene that set up many of the events in ""Deathly Hallows""; particularly the reaction of the non-humans in the magical world to Dumbledore's passing. My disappointment aside, I have to say that pt 1 of ""Deathly Hallows"" is very well done.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence, David Yates sets a pace that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Even when the story reaches the part my family refers to as, ""the Never-ending Camping Trip,"" Yates and the principle actors keep it engaging...avoiding the mid-movie doldrums often found in longer films. Steve Kloves also did a great job with the script in providing the perfect place for the cliff-hanger with which pt 1 ended. And as many have mentioned, the animated ""Tale of the Three Brothers"" was simply delightful!<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful movie and a beautiful way to begin the end of an iconic series. I anxiously await Part 2."

","¬®The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever made, the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.¬®<br/><br/>The Harry Potter series is finally coming to an end after ten years and The Deathly Hallows promises to be an exciting conclusion to the franchise. Producers correctly decided to divide the movie in two parts in order to remain as faithful as possible to the book and not leave minor characters out of the story like they had to do with the other films. It is hard to review a movie that is actually only halfway through the story, but the first part of The Deathly Hallows was exciting and captivating. The 140 minutes flew by real fast and even though the film had an inconclusive ending I still enjoyed the ride and can't wait for the final farewell. I think this is one of my favorite films of the franchise as the characters continue to mature over time. It has been a thrilling ride as these heroes have grown to be a part of us and this movie is more about them than the actual story or the special effects. We've grown up with these characters and they have come a long way from The Sorcerer's Stone. The series has also grown much darker over time, and The Deathly Hallows goes one step further from the very beginning with the snake scene. This was director David Yates third straight Harry Potter film (and he also directed the second part which will be released in January). Once again Steve Kloves does a great job with the adaptation of the screenplay of J.K. Rowling's novel. Fans of the series won't be disappointed and will be in line waiting for the premiere of the final chapter to say farewell to such beloved characters that have been a part of us all these years.<br/><br/>The movie picks off right where The Half Blood Prince left us. Dumbledore is dead, Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is searching for Harry Potter along with his crew, and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is on a journey to try to destroy the seven horcruxes with his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) before it is too late and Voldemort becomes too powerful. The task of finding and destroying these horcruxes isn't an easy one, as Voldemort's people are everywhere searching for him along with snatchers, and Dumbledore hasn't told Harry where these pieces are hidden. Along their journey they will discover the legend of the three deathly hallows (hence the title): the elder wand, the resurrection stone, and the cloak of invisibility that will make the possessor of these three elements master over death. There are several new characters introduced in the series and some old ones appear and they all end up playing a key part in this seek and destroy journey. Just be warned before you see this movie, don't expect a conclusive ending because this is only the first part of the story and the film leaves us at the halfway point. But I think the producers did a good job at finding the correct spot to put a pause on The Deathly Hallows before the second part finally comes out. <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have grown so much professionally with the Harry Potter films. They have become great actors and one only needs to see the first Potter film (The Sorcerer's Stone) and compare it to this last installment in order to see how much they have matured. These three kids have literally grown right in front of our eyes over these past ten years and I have to admit that they have done a tremendous job keeping pace with such great actors in this series as Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Brendan Gleeson, Robbie Coltrane, and Gary Oldman. The Deathly Hallows does a great job of recognizing the success of the franchise in that it is a character driven film and we get a lot of that in this seventh movie. The main difference between this movie and the rest is that it doesn't take place in Hogwarts and we get a lot of varied locations. Since the movie is divided in two parts we also get a lot more details and background stories which made the ride a lot more enjoyable as well. The scene were Lovegood tells Harry about the deathly hallows is great. That short animated sequence could very well compete independently for best short animated film and easily win the Oscars because it was just brilliant. I really enjoyed this first part of the final chapter of the series and am looking forward to the final part. I really don't know who I hate more for now: Lord Voldemort or Bellatrix Lestrange because they have both done tremendous jobs as villains. Director David Yates has done a great job at bringing the world of Harry Potter to the big screen once again. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","This film is just amazing.<br/><br/>The basic plot of the film is that Lord Voldermort has gained complete control over the ministry and Harry Ron and Hermione have to find the remaining horcruxes if they have any hope in defeating Lord Voldermort.<br/><br/>Well to start with this film has a potent mix of elements in a few other genres. It has the jumpy scenes like in a horror film along with the thrilling aspect.<br/><br/>The film itself sets up the beginning for the end of a great series of films/books.<br/><br/>Unlike many book adapted films this film is very very very close to the novel. I only saw a few things being altered.<br/><br/>Anyway the way they split the book into 2 parts was perfect; they left it on a cliffhanger and it is a sad ending that will counter-act the happy ending in part2.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT NOW!

","Harry Potter, a.k.a. the boy who lived. We have seen him grow as in the previous 6 movies and here in the deathly hallows, the end is coming. Part 1 is a really good. So far one of the best of the series, however this has 2 problems. First there is not enough magic as in the other films which lose the wizard touch to the film and two, when Belatrix marks Hermione, it reminded me of the Holocaust, when they marked the Jewish prisoners. I have to say that, that scene should have not been portrayed because it might be offensive to people. However the movie is so well explained you could understand it. Overall the movie is really great, and the cliffhanger in the end leaves me wanting for more. Luckily part 2 comes out soon."

","One of the great joys of the Harry Potter movies has been that I've been able to take one of my grandnieces to see them. She loves them. However, she just turned 11 and so won't be able to go to this one. Why? -- because of ONE scene that did NOT need to be done the way it was.... the hallucination would have been just as effective in making it's point if the CGI version of those involved had been clothed, and the film could have been PG as the others have been. I enjoyed the movie, until that scene and all I could think of is ""oh @#$%, I won't be able to take her to this one and she's going to be seriously bummed""... effectively diminishing my enjoyment of the rest of the film and almost leading me to walk out of the theater. That one scene took away a lot of the audience by blocking out kids who've seen all the ones before it. Shame on the producers for not taking them into account when making this one. They effectively thumbed their noses at a good section of potential audience, and I hope the box office on this one suffers for it. If you decide after making a series of PG movies that the next one in the series should be rated so that a good portion of your audience-base can't see it, you deserve to have your wallet suffer for it. There are now a slew of kids all across the country who are seriously bummed (right before Christmas no less) -- why? Because some moron(s) decided that it doesn't matter if they're old enough to see this movie or not -- even if they've seen all the previous ones in the series, they didn't count enough to take into account... idiotic, short-sighted, and even into ""mean"" IMO.<br/><br/>Add in that I paid extra for IMAX that turned out to not even be 3D... and while in many respects it was a good film... the experience was grossly disappointing.<br/><br/>But it could have been the most brilliant film ever made and the switch from PG to PG-13, combined with an ""IMAX"" version that wasn't 3D, and it still would be getting a low rating."

","The acting has come a LONG way and so far, this is the trio of young magicians at their best. There's no meed to get into the wonder of J. K. Rowling's intricate story. It was a truly masterfully written series. I'm not one to pander to the commerce-driven lack of vision or talent that spews out onto the screens these days (expecially from Hollywood) but this decision to make 2 films was wise as it explains more. And this film is, in its own right, invaluable, a must-see and downright amazing.<br/><br/>I've read reviews of how it was 'slow-paced.' Are they insane?? The film kicks off with Scrimgour's (Nighy) FABULOUS characterization of the times in a brilliant piece of casting. Then there's the secret mission to move Harry, a harrowing ambush and battle, seeing the shocking death of 2 moving characters. The suspense building at Malfoy Manor, and a gristly murder. An ambushed wedding. Chases by snatchers. Fallings out. Betrayals. More ambushes, showing the diabolical sorcery of Voldemort in his pet/horcrux Nagini. Lovegood's ambush, magical discoveries, kidnappings, rescue attempts and culminating in a brave sacrifice. Then the film ends with a desecration and promise of future horrors. DARK, DARK DARK!! :o) This is no sanctimonious summary. These were the events. And if the film slows down from time to time to reveal more of the complexity of emotional changes that the characters must undergo, and to reveal the complicated plot, not otherwise evident due to the absence of prose (it the FILM, not the book!)....then this is NECESSARY and welcome to convey the veracity of good characterization, and a good story. And it doesn't stay slow for long.<br/><br/>I just can't wait for the final show-down! Some AMAZING actresses and actors will be conveying some amazing characters and I look forward to Alan Rickman's grand revelation of Severus Snape and Maggie Smith's rise to all her glory as the Minerva that NO ONE should mess with! And Molly Weasely showing that a mother's love is its own potent brew...how ironic, given that this was the lesson Voldemort himself should have not just learned but passed on. :o) I have faith in the next film because if this one is anything to go by, the next one will be simply AMAZING!"

","When I was 8 I got Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone for Christmas. I loved it and it got instilled as part of my childhood. Then the films came, others hated them,mainly for omitting key elements of the books but I enjoyed them for what they were: a visual representation of a series many love.<br/><br/>Like others when I heard DH was being split into two films I was cynical to say the least then I saw pt1. Shocked is an understatement.I went with my best friend who had already seen it so knew all the emotional points of the film and looked at me whenever they occurred. She said that for a kid who doesn't show emotions she'd never seen such an erray of emotions.<br/><br/>The tone is darker, as usual.But this time it fits,it's no longer just a gimmick to draw in older audiences but integral to the plot. The books got genuinely darker but the films just felt like it had been shoehorned in. DH though,manages to make it feel naturally darker.Be it from the muted colours,ominous soundtrack or overall sense of desperation JK portrayed in the book.Quite honestly I thought the film did a better job of showing the tension between Harry,Ron and Hermione.The book described it brilliantly but Grint managed to steal the film in my opinion with subtle facial expressions that are paired with love and jealousy culminating into showing what matters most to him Yes things are omitted again but this time it's for the better as they'd probably take away from the atmosphere, things that had been left out before are briefly explained(Greyback attacking Bill in HBP for example) but none of this would have mattered if the actors and special effects hadn't been as amazing as they were. The effects look natural and the actors have really matured.The one scene I enjoyed highly was the Three Brothers tale brilliantly narrated with amazing visuals. The audio too is amazing, the soundtrack subtler and in a surprising move cut out completely during one chase scene which just added to its intensity. The main thing that cemented its status as amazing though was Dobby's death.When he died in the book all I screamed in maths for weeks was 'DOBBY'S DEAD'.The film though actually took me beyond crying, sobbing to a point where my friend had to actually hug me and comfort me. This is from a guy who never cries.The single annoyance for me though wasn't the fleeting appearances of some characters,or the omitance of some scenes or even the feel it's a 'road movie' no all these make the film feel like it should;desolate,desperate and isolated.Completely on edge. No I was annoyed Dobby's headstone wasn't included.Possibly the most poignant moment of the entire series for me but I can forgive them for that as the film was still amazing. It ended where I thought it would and left me wanting more after the 146min runtime literally flew by. If pt2 manages to be this true and amazing Potter fans are in for an spectacular swansong. 10/10 easily. Oh and a note to Twillight fans,actors and directors...this is how true love and friendship is displayed.Not by smouldering looks and a plot thrown in.No instead infuse the plot with natural feelings and you get a true relationship created not the soft-core porn for teenage girls I was forced to sit through.That is all. Cloud932 out."
"asjad-mehmood","7","0","2","11 December 2010"," Emma and Rupert's lack of interest in their roles
","I've been watching Hollywood movies ever since I came to this world (*sarcasm*) and I always concentrate on two aspects of the movie, the acting and dialog delivering. This past week I've been going over the whole Harry Potter series watching three young kids become teenagers, their acting, expression and confidence improving with every epic episode of the series. Taking into consideration the latest of the series ""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows Part I"" there were a lot of new faces as compared to the previous episodes. The good thing about the movie was the storyline that mostly revolved around Daniel, Rupert and Emma. Some of the acting scenes were really exceptional but I was a little disappointed in Rupert and Emma's acting. The reason being, I couldn't see the same enthusiasm and passion which they portrayed in the previous episodes.<br/><br/>Emma, although did good but wasn't great and I couldn't see the spark that she had earlier. She did a good job in delivering the dialogs but the way she used to express previously was missing this time. It seemed as if she was acting forcefully and wasn't happy. Similarly she was also lacking the eagerness of proving herself. In short she could have done an exceptional job by paying more attention to expression and adapting greater keenness towards her role. Rupert did a good job but could have been better and I believe he lacked interest in his role; it seemed as if he was tired and bored of playing the same role again and again. As for Daniel, he did an exceptional job, acted and delivered in a perfect way and I could see a lot of energy and enthusiasm. It seemed as if Daniel was there for Rupert and Emma and helped them pull through the movie.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason being for Emma and Rupert's lack of interest in their roles one thing was clear that they were bored of doing the same old routine for the past decade."
"mike-adly5","8","0","2","8 December 2010"," In a Nutshell: ""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1"" (8/10)
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1...""These are dark times, there's no denying""<br/><br/>If you read around and check out reviews on The Deathly Hallows, you'll see that the most predominant theme of the hype about this film is anticipation. Literally, the most redundant keyword in the first paragraph of any article, any review or any news report is the word ""Finally"". HP7 is tagged in its trailer as the finale of the worldwide phenomenon, the motion picture of a generation. Needless to say, it is one of the best selling stories of all times. Bottom line is, like the movie or not, it made over 300 million dollars in the first few days, and judging by how things look, this should be just a tiny fraction of its coming success.<br/><br/>As a result of the intense criticism on the last three Potter movies for not being worthy of the books, David Yates and Warner Bros. had to spread the finale on two long films; a decision leading to an utter cinematic and commercial success. And since the fans can't get enough, you can always give them some more on the boy who lived, the chosen one and his magical adventures that have become the prevailing obsession of millions around the globe.<br/><br/>The gloominess of the opening scene and the dramatic dose you get from the film's first lines spoken by Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) tell you all about what you're in for; a journey of darkness, a daring quest of the good to defy the evil, a hopeful adventure shadowed by blood, love, tears and death. After the sad ending of late Dumbledore, it is now Harry's mission to find and destroy all the horcruxes that shield Lord Voldemort from death. As Potter accompanies his lifetime mates Ron and Hermione through their ultimate journey, they stumble across some of the most significant and powerful secrets of the wizarding world, the deathly hallows.<br/><br/>When you watch The Deathly Hallows Part one, you'd only wish they did the same with at least the last two books; split them in two. God knows how many scenes and characters had to be knocked out to fit in something like The Order of the Phoenix in one movie. This time they fill it in with details that even book readers may have forgotten about. The events go on sort of an inverse bell curve scenario; it starts off exhilarating and thrilling, it mellows down a bit in the middle and then it gets all fired up towards an ending that comes very quick.<br/><br/>It is safe to say that behind the scenes aspects, of making a movie, all played out quite well in this one. We've seen more sophisticated cinematography and art direction in previous episodes of the saga, but this still does have its eye catching moments as well. Acting, however, has evidentially elevated quite a bit here. An obvious reason for that is the age of the main three characters that have grown in shape and experience through ten years of shooting. But it is not to be ignored that Emma Watson is the one that stands out this time; her character's confusion of emotion, determination and humour were damn sure not easy to be portrayed as good as she did.<br/><br/>We've also seen something new to the saga in this one, and it was indeed some of the most amusing three minutes of the whole thing, an actual animated short. The tale of the three brothers narrated by Hermione plays back in a shadow, puppet- like animated sequence, that is just pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, The Deathly Hallows Part one is merely is a lengthy introduction to the ultimate climax of this masterpiece of a story. It's truly beyond me how J K Rowling is not yet up for a Noble Prize in Literature. This film paves quite the road to what's coming ahead, and looking at that combo trailer, it gonna be quite fun. It will feel at the end as if someone has switched the TV off in the middle of your movie. You will really want some more. Too bad you'll have to wait another eight months for it."

","Having just seen this movie yesterday (05/12/2010), I can honestly say that it was exactly what I expected it to be, except for its darkness. Compare this to the first movie in the series and there are more similarities to Star Wars than Harry Potter! I think JKR is trying to get us to leave the theatre in a cloud of doom and depression, as it is so dark. Having watched all the movies to date, I felt like most people that I had better watch them to the end. I wish I hadn't bothered. Don't get me wrong though, these are good movies all of them. But they are so unlike each other, I don't remember my five years in high school being so different every year in succession. They should be seen as seven, (sorry, eight!) different movies and not a series. The worst part of all of this though is that yesterday I paid the full price at the theatre to watch half a movie. Oh I know Warner Bros is suffering as there are only a finite number of HP movies, but I am not a rich man and nowhere near as rich as anyone who has anything to do with this movie! Making it in two parts, no let me rephrase that, making it in ONE part and splitting that into two and charging two fees for one movie is a big con, the book wasn't anywhere near as big as 'The Order of the Phoenix' so there is no need to split it up. Even my partner felt that a lot of this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor as it just dragged on and on. Now of course this will become a new thing, I have heard that there are other big movies to be made in one part yet split into two. Come on Hollywood! I want to support you by visiting the cinema and buying genuine Blu-ray Discs, but I am not like yourselves, made of money!"

","Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore has died. The Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) addresses the wider wizarding world at the Ministry of Magic, on Lord Voldermort's return of power.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hermione Granger saw her parents were in the living room. Standing behind her parents without them noticing her and with a heavy heart, the Muggle-born talented witch began wiping away her parents' memories and erasing her from all of the family portraits which also included her childhood days. It is to remove her parents of any knowledge of having any memories of the existence of their only child. As for Harry Potter, he saw from his bedroom window as he sees his relatives pack up the car and leaving him behind. For Ron Weasley, he stood outside the family home of the Burrow, thinking about the task which lies ahead for him and his two friends.<br/><br/>Severus Snape has arrived at the Malfoy Manor where Lord Voldermort is holding a meeting between himself and his Death Eaters (which also now includes Draco Malfoy). After Snape takes his place, he began to inform the date and time Harry Potter will be moved from his home. Not only that, Snape also added that the Ministry has been infiltrated. Voldermort then said that he must be the one to kill Harry, but he cannot do so as due to the connection shared between the cores of his wand and Harry's. It would be Lucius Malfoy's wand Voldermort uses and kills his hostage in the Muggle Studies professor Charity Burbage (Carolyn Pickles) and later feeds the body to his pet snake Nagini with the Death Eaters looking on.<br/><br/>At Harry Potter's residence, members of the Order of the Phoenix (which now includes engaged couple Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour) arrived to bring Harry to the Burrow. But there is a problem. Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody explained that since Harry still has the trace in him (as he has not 17 yet, which in the wizarding world is under aged); they can't apparate or use the Floo network without being watched by the Ministry of Magic, so flying to the Burrow is the only way. But before everyone can go to the Burrow, they have to all disguise themselves as Harry first by taking the Polyjuice Potion. The plan is that if the Death Eaters attacked them while they are on the move, they will not know which the real Harry Potter is. The real Harry took off with Hagrid on Sirius Black's flying motorcycle, as before that with Harry releases his owl Hedwig to fly and meet them at the Burrow. As everyone takes off, they are being attacked by the Death Eaters almost immediately. Soon there was a chase, which even Hedwig is being involved but eventually got killed in the process. Harry then found himself being pursued by Lord Voldermort, and his wand acts on its own accord and defends Harry from Voldermort, destroying Lucius Malfoy's wand in the process.<br/><br/>After Harry and Hagrid landed at the Burrow, the rest of the Order arrives, with everyone shaken of the attack and the betrayal. When George Weasley and Remus Lupin show up, it would be George having his left ear being cursed off. After George's older brother Bill arrives at the Burrow, he informs everyone that Mad-Eye Moody has been killed and that Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden) has escaped in fear. When everyone is asleep, Harry attempted to leave, with the guilt that people are either getting injured or died for him. Ron stopped Harry from leaving and convinces him of what he has to do, and that he should stay longer for Bill and Fleur's wedding. But Harry had a dream of Voldemort raging at an imprisoned Ollivander, the wandmaker, about Lucius's wand not working to defeat Harry.<br/><br/>While everyone is preparing for the wedding, the Minister of Magic in Rufus Scrimgeour arrives and specifically meets Harry, Ron and Hermione. Scrimgeour then revealed that Albus Dumbledore has left them possessions in his will. For Ron, it is a Deluminator. For Hermione, it is a copy of a series of wizarding children's stories in The Tales of Beedle the Bard. For Harry, it is the Golden Snitch which Harry had caught it in his first Quidditch match. But that is not it as Scrimgeour added that Dumbledore has also left him the sword of Godric Gryffindor, but since it was not Dumbledore's to give away and that the sword is missing currently, Harry cannot receive it.<br/><br/>At the wedding, Harry talked to Elphias Dodge, who had known Dumbledore and wrote the obituary in The Daily Prophet. Their conversation was cut short by Ron's Aunt Muriel (Matyelok Gibbs) who filled them with various stories of Dumbledore's past. Just then, the wedding was interrupted with by Kingsley Shacklebolt's Patronus arriving and informing that the Ministry has fallen, Rufus Scrimgeour is dead and the Death Eaters are on their way.<br/><br/>Thus the uncertain times really begins in the wizarding world, with no one is sure of whom to trust and even the friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione being tested in their search for the Horcruxes. The film is certainly not one for the faint-hearted, but watch it for why the title of the film adaptation takes after the seventh and final book of the famous series in terms of being called 'The Deathly Hallows'.<br/><br/>On a personal scale, what stands out are the scene of Hermione removing the memories of her parents and herself from the family portraits, where the meeting of Voldermort and his followers is close to what I expected after initially reading the book, the 'Seven Harry Potters' scene which does provide some comic relief in a film which is surely not sunny given of the direction being taken as we are reaching near the climax of the series which will be revealed in the second part."

I thought this was going to be another ""unlike the book and boring crap."" But I was wrong. It was very good. I'll tell you why. It had this suspense in it that made the movie masterful. I love how Harry, Ron, and Hermione has now grown and they are fully youth. Voldemort is my favorite character because his acting is so good. This harry potter was different. It wasn't like the other harry potters where they always go on the train and go to hogwarts. I personally thought this was a bit similar to lord of the rings. Where in lord of the rings they have to return the ring back to the Mount Doom, this is similar. In this, they have to find the Horcruxes.

","First off I really liked this movie.<br/><br/>I would actually say it is the best so far in the series - due to the darkness and the evil that was So much missing in the last movie.<br/><br/>There is one thing that made me puzzle though.<br/><br/>In Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets the trio is planning to go down to Slytherins champers to ease drop on Malfoy to see if he is he direct decenter of Slytherin.<br/><br/>To do this they need to make the Poly Juice potion and this takes very very long to create.<br/><br/>So they only go later in the movie after the potion have brewed for weeks even months.<br/><br/>And then again in The Prisinor of Azkaban The impostor being Mad-eye Moody have to steal ingredients from Snape to make more potion as the ingredients is VERY hard to get a hold of and VERY rare.<br/><br/>At the start of Deathly Hallows part 1 we see all character drink the poly potion and that is all good - but they drink from Mad-eyes canteen and he keeps it.<br/><br/>Then at the weeding they are suddenly rushed away as the death eaters show up and go to London.<br/><br/>The Trio then decides to use poly potion to look like the 3 employees in the ministry and changes into them to be able to enter.<br/><br/>There is only passing ¬Ω day (1 night) from they come up with this idea until they carrie it out.<br/><br/>------ So we have just learned that this potion is extremely rare, takes very very long time to brew and then out of the Blue they just happen to have a bottle in Hermoiness bag (just in case)....<br/><br/>This seems like a bit of a stretch to me.<br/><br/>.....<br/><br/>But as I said at the start I very much liked the movie...and I look forward to the final part 2."

","If you are new to Harry Potter and decide to start your journey into the Potter universe with DEATHLY HALLOWS PART-1 then you are making a grave mistake,for going unprepared with no idea about the complexity of the series its concepts and multitude of brilliant characters is a huge insult to the penultimate movie in the Potter movie franchise.<br/><br/>DH-1 is complex,dark,gritty and shocking.David Yates delivers disturbing elements like NAZI treatments of the mud-bloods and muggles with efficiency and ease,the toll of isolation and complete silence on the human psyche is evident,the pain of abandoning one's parents is beautifully portrayed.<br/><br/>In deathly hallows we have lot of room for Dark Humor,if we have the Minister Of Magic confessing ""these are dark times there is no denying"" then we also have the new FASCISTS Government's propaganda against those who are a threat to it by billing out propaganda saying 'WHEN MUGGLES ATTACK' or articles claiming 'HOW TO IDENTIFY MUDBLOODS'.<br/><br/>The antagonist Voldemort is growing in power and this is evident from clippings on news-paper reporting deaths of innocents murdered brutally or DEATH-EATERS increasing in number or radio shows being broadcast-ed by people on the run listing names of those missing,but the word MISSING is just and excuse to avoid the harrowing fact that they have been killed.<br/><br/>The trio escapes the clutches of Dark Lord however there only hiding is snatched from them and they are forced to go on exile trying to riddle out Voldemort's roots to his existence.<br/><br/>We also have the snatchers who are kept to do the filthiest (murder,loot and dishonor) by the Death-eaters,we have ministry officials wearing red-bands a reminder of the Nazi Swastika and punishments for those who dare to take the Dark Lord's name loudly insulting him.<br/><br/>The movie sticks faithfully to the pace of the book thus bringing out the true colors of the characters and the emotional toll the journey takes on OUR BELOVED TRIO played effortlessly by the lead of EMMA,RUPERT AND DANIEL.the cinematography showing vast landscapes tells us about how lonely our trio is,the seeping pale colors tells us that fun times are over.the back-ground score is no more cheesy and fits perfectly,the music itself acts as a character.the direction is smooth and the camera angles though simple is captivating.the movie in entirety has a very fresh feel to it with the familiar Views of THE HOGWARTS CASTLE AND ITS GROUNDS BEING COMPLETELY ABSENT from the scene.<br/><br/>Deathly hallows is a movie steeped in uncertainty with our trio lost spiritually and directionally as Harry realizes that his mentor Dumbledore is no longer there to guide him,as he realizes that even people he thought to be friends are actually foes.<br/><br/>It brings out beautifully the pain of loosing ones family,of loosing a dear friend to an untimely death,of bidding farewell to one's best-friend.and these actually fulfills Voldemort's lines ""you are a fool Harry Potter and you will loose everything"" from the 5th movie.<br/><br/>Deathly hallows is not fit for the children,its no longer a family movie as the dark undertones,the highly advanced wizarding warfare,the Hermione torcher scene,close-up of the dead bodies has a lasting effect on our mind and are disturbing enough.<br/><br/>Its a movie which you appreciate more and more with multiple watchings,a movie with various layer and varying shades of human emotions.it is perhaps the most moving Picture in the FANTASY GENRE with no blingy dresses like in Narnia or unwanted opulent visuals and million dollar special effects like in Lord of the Rings or highly Exaggerated action sequences like the Twilight series.the special & visual effects is controlled and the Dramatic elements under-played unlike other movies in this and it is perhaps the simplicity itself which exudes lot of charm and warmth and makes DEATHLY HALLOWS A TRUE DESERVING WINNER.its a compelling tale which if you truly want to appreciate in its true form then you must refer to the previous movies and literary pieces of J.K.ROWLING.<br/><br/>THREE CHEERS FOR David YATES AND HIS TEAM."

","I very love the books and movies about Potter and the magic world, which were created by the legendary author J. K. Rowling. Numerous journeys, unbelievable and amazing situations, different problems and its' decisions - this everything I liked when I've read the first book and have watched the first movie ""Harry Potter"". I may name myself a real fan of Potteriana, because I adore all the parts (as movies, as books) of it and I think everybody will agree with me, that Potter's world and the main theme of the saga are very wonderful, interesting, sometimes it's funny and sometimes it's enough sad, but, in total here's a great story for all the family...<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the end of ""Half-blood prince"" shows to us, that there's the Evil and it's very strong, besides we know that Potter and his friends have to fight with the Dark lord and his army. As result, some of these two sides will definitely lose, paying for it with the life. So, all the events of ""Deathly Hallows. Part 1st"" let us to know - life's changed, the evil surrounds the good guys and it may attack any time of the night or the day. Our favorite heroes Harry, Ron and Hermione certainly grew up, but they enough young to decide such hard problems, which they've got. Watching this movie, You understand, that the light and happy times have gone and it, perhaps, will never come again.<br/><br/>Well, I liked this movie, first of all, because it's enough emotional, real, it shows to viewer, that changes may be negative and ""happy yesterday"" may become ""sad tomorrow"". It's really very sad story: there're a lot of well-known heroes were murdered, the dark times have come and the boy who has survived must prepare and to be ready for the final fight, which will come soon, very soon. For those people, who have read (and for those, who gonna read) the last book, it will be interesting to know, how the creators of the movie will film the final battle and scenes of trials, when old war will be over finally and only one - Harry Potter or VoldeMort will win.<br/><br/>Finishing My speech, I wish for everybody, who hasn't watched yet the 7th movie from Potteriana series to watch it, and for those guys, who want to watch the last movie - to wait till the summer and to hope that Potter will come back again only to win..."
"kalel41","9","0","1","28 November 2010"," is Harry Potter Oscar Worthy?
","From the beginning I have been a fan of the movies. I never had the interest to pick up a Harry Potter book. OK OK, I'm lying I did read ""The Goblet of Fire"" and enjoyed it very much, but the first movie is what really got me hooked to J.K. Rowling's magical world. ""The Deathly Hallows Part one"" is certainly a departure from the rest of the series and is a breath of fresh air. Even though I loved the Quidditch matches, and the fun times at Hogwarts, I honestly did not miss it watching this film. Yes, they are grown up and the film itself is quite dark but there is room for some wonderful special effect sequences and comedic moments that aren't forced and arise from the situation. I love how each character has evolved and in this one the actors really have to dig deeper to convey their emotions. The acting is definitely better in this than any other Potter film, and the clear stand out for me was Emma Watson. I think artistically she was always the underdog when it came to acting. For me she really did steal the show in this one. The pacing of the film becomes a bit slow in the second act but it's never boring. The characters struggles amongst each other are quite fun to watch. David Yates has really captured the spirit of Harry Potter and the urgency it needed before it reaches its spectacular conclusion. We will have to wait til July 2011 for that, but for now the first part will have to do. Another wonderful extra to this film is a fantastically animated story explaining the story of ""The Deathly Hallows"". It was a real treat!<br/><br/>This is not only one of the best Potter films but in my opinion is one of the best films of the year. If there was ever a Potter film that would be considered for an Academy Award or at least a Golden Globe, this would be it. I remember back in 2003, when ""Return of the King"" hit theaters and watching it there was a sense of conclusion, an ""epic-ness"" of something great coming to an end. It was felt throughout the audience. I felt much of the same vibe watching ""The Deathly Hallows"". I love this movie, it is my favorite of the series and I hope part two is just as good if not better. Go see it!<br/><br/>*for more no nonsense, honest, thoughtful reviews check out THE-TICKING-TICKET...is the movie worth your time? http://tickingticket.blogspot.com/"
"Danusha_Goska","5","0","2","21 November 2010"," One Magic Scene
","I am immune to the appeal of the Harry Potter phenom. I try to watch the films every now and then to see if I can get a handle on what all the fuss is about. It still eludes me. I was bored through this movie, with one scene standing out as engaging and interesting and having some magic, some sparkle. Obviously, mine is not the majority view.<br/><br/>I find Daniel Radcliffe frighteningly cute. He's just a child! Scary. The scene where several Harrys remove their shirts at once ‚Äì wow. Hand me my fan.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is one of the all-time great film actors. He does evil very well ‚Äì see ""Schindler's List."" Here he is wearing some kind of CGI no-nose Halloween mask and he doesn't raise so much as one goose pimple. Fiennes could have made this villain, Voldemort, really scary if they had removed the silly make-up/cgi. As it is, you look at him and think, poor guy, some kind of no-nose birth defect. It would be unkind to stare. Hire the differently abled! I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I'd read a review saying that Hermione had to erase her family's memories of her, and that that was very poignant. That happens in an opening scene that lasts about a minute. Had I not read the review, I would have had no idea what was happening. Whatever was happening was not poignant to this viewer.<br/><br/>I didn't, and still don't, know what a horcrux is. Characters have magical powers, but which characters have which powers? Voldemort wants to kill Harry; Voldemort has magical powers. Why doesn't Voldemort just use his magical powers to kill Harry? What's preventing him? I have no idea, because I don't know how magical powers are apportioned, or resisted, in this world. There's scene after scene of wands and chases and searches and I never knew what anyone could do with what spell or wand, so I didn't know what was at stake and what needed to be done to protect what was at stake. At one point Ron tells Harry ""It's about more than you."" What is it about? Box office revenue.<br/><br/>There's a scene where Harry is caught under ice, alone in a forest at night: a real claustrophobe's paranoid nightmare. I found I could watch the scene without any anxiety. Now that's poor filmmaking.<br/><br/>There is so much stuff slathered on screen: eccentric English cottages with floating pears growing outside the front door, magical tents, protective snowy owls, elevators that travel sideways ‚Äì and I never once said ""Oooo"" or ""Aaaa"" (except for that scene where multiple Harrys bear multiple post-adolescent, nicely muscled, newly hairy chests ‚Äì ooo baby). Nothing felt magical to me. The ever present on screen junk all had the same, loud, tacky, K-Mart Christmas feel. ""Less is more"" anyone? There was one scene that worked. I was caught up in it, and, even as I was watching it, I imagined legions of fangirls watching this scene again and again once the home version is released. Harry and Hermione are feeling low. They are alone in a tent in a forest. Music is playing on a staticky radio. The camera focuses on Hermione in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the view of Hermione is blocked by Harry's sweater-clad shoulder. In the same way that he is blocking the scene, he is overwhelming Hermione's consciousness. He extends his hand to her; she rises; they dance, their bodies directed by their despair, their hunger for intimacy with each other, and their fear that satisfying that desire is not a wise idea. It's a truly magical scene, and all too brief. And it required no special effects, just young people you care about who are trying to thrive, as all of us do, through contact, music, art, and dance, in a life-or-death situation."
"Jules45","8","0","1","28 November 2010"," Average additions be gone, things are starting to get magic at last.
","No-one was forthcoming about OOTP and HBP. They have succeeded in the infamous Potter manoeuvre of neither being wildly brilliant or atrociously laughable, but always being huge box office phenomenon's that have now outdone the likes of Star Wars, so they must have been doing something right, right? <br/><br/>Well other than being the best franchise rights attained by Warner Bros. for being such a successful series, they always were inviting to people new to the experience, specifically those who hadn't read the books. The problem? The people who are fans of the book (including your dear critic) are always spotting the missing scenes, the awkward relationships - that aren't supposed to be awkward and the rare but recent addition of scenes that had as much logic and point behind them as singing into a turned on Hoover nozzle. <br/><br/>So being the best book, (arguably) the routinely depression encased within the restriction Hogwarts has lifted, as has the more customary check list. Big castle, problem, another problem, acting sad, kissing, wand walloping, morning, end. For once the relationships, like the plot, aren't constraint to the walls of Hogwarts, they are free at last. <br/><br/>Though Yates has been irksomely juggling the same premise for two films too long he makes up by, fi-na-le being faithful through the decision to cleanly cut the film in two. He also includes additional scenes (wait for it) that aren't unlike the characters motivations; HBP had the attack of the Burrow scene with no motivation from Death Eaters what so ever. In Deathly Hallows there are emotional additions that aren't hosted in a sulky and heavy atmosphere, such as when Harry is trying to console Hermione. <br/><br/>The film also amplifies its standard of being funny, something which the books only mildly covered as a quick disengagement from the 'fun'. And for the first time in history, when the newly instated Minister of Magic quotes: ""These are dark times, there is no denying."" the theme turned clich√© of diluting the lighting for the gazillionth time so it's darker therefore 'more rugged and scary' - lives up to its sense of impending doom, without having the usual buzz of hopeful expectancy followed by obvious disappointment - like the lottery always does. <br/><br/>It's quiet easy to be bitter about the fact the best director, Alfonso Cuaron, never got the chance to make another instalment that could have established a new high point of the relatively indistinguishable mountain but saying that, Yates would never have got the chance to prove he can make one of the best additions to the series, that wasn't even close to being the money-grabbing, giant tease it could have been. If Part II can be this enjoyable to all audiences, then the Potter finale will rouse as much love as when he was first seen branded with his slogan scar and if not, it would at least be well-deserved to see Part I make the top 250."
"mi_adi","Null","0","5","27 November 2010"," Better than the rest of the Potter films..........although a little childish
","Announcing an end to the Potter series, this is the first of two parts of the final chapter of the enigmatic Potter franchise. When i went to see this movie i had no expectations at all. but i came back with some from the second part of the same. the story unfolds quite smoothly although some parts take quite some time to play out. David Yates is surely in the stage of evolution and will definitely supply a string of good films if he does not loiter in there for too long. he has tried to embroider a childish story with maturity, and the effect is worth noticing. his efforts are let down by the weak characters and their childish emotions which is no doubt expected of them at their given age. but the trio hardly look like 16 years old and look more like nearing 20. the atmosphere is impeccably built from the beginning of the film and Yates does not fail to generate the thrill with a few well conceived and naturally enfolding action sequences.<br/><br/>he has employed some popular and creative methods to tell the story and the overall impression on the viewer is in the positive. the film is better than the earlier ones in context to the screenplay which has improved quite fashionably and unlike that expected from a film which is basically aimed at the under 20 population. good work by Steve Kloves in this. also the computer generated images are very realistic thanks to the advancement in computer animation technology.<br/><br/>David Yates has really done justice to the novel but has let down the momentum of the film yet he also maintains that briskness which is required to tell the long and engaging story. the film clearly portrays the emotions of love, sacrifice, betrayal and friendship. Daniel Radcliffe has given his best performance so far in the series and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give acceptable and desired performances.<br/><br/>on the whole, the film is a visual spectacle, a must watch for potter fans, a definite betterment from the earlier films and with a better background score as well. If you want to go and watch a film with your family and want them to like it too, this is the one.<br/><br/>considering the overall impression of the film on me, id give it a 7.8 out of 10"
"marine-mostwantedo","6","0","1","26 November 2010"," Mixed Up Feelings
","I've read all the Harry Potter books and they are the best books ever. Must say, Rowling is the savior of teenager reading skills. The earlier movies were great, I still enjoy them. I just cannot imagine any better actors and environment for the stories. The first two were probably the closest to the book, or that's at least how I think. I didn't really enjoy the third one; it has a weird decor. The fourth one was brilliant, the fifth was okay, and the sixth was a bit darker and much more emotional. But one thing combines these 6 movies - Hogwarts.<br/><br/>In the 7th book the trio isn't in Hogwarts anymore. I got used to it while reading the book pretty fast, but didn't while watching the movie. It was so different. <br/><br/>Anyway, must say that I'm glad they split up the seventh movie into two parts, because it simply has way too many things.<br/><br/>This movie was very close to the book. Like when I was reading the book in 2007, I was watching this movie already. The image was very close. They even put some little details, but also missed some. They could make the beginning more like the book's. Also, my friends say that the movie didn't follow some details, like how exactly they found out something about one thing, but I didn't notice any. Maybe I just started to forget what the book told.<br/><br/>In the other hand, this movie was very dark and it was very hard to get used to the outside of Hogwarts. Sometimes it seemed that they stretched the scenes for way too long. I mean, yes, even the book tells about all their boredom but the movie showed it in a bit more different way. And in the end, after the movie, I was depressed.<br/><br/>I was so damn sad and lost. I couldn't leave many things out of my head. I almost cried in the theater (70% of the audience did). So yeah, it is also a powerful movie. Not every filmmaker can make people cry, and make the wizard world so real.<br/><br/>So after a few days I started to remember the little funny parts, and suddenly wanted to watch the movie again.<br/><br/>I'm waiting in excitement for the second part. It has to be better because the book tells about way more things in more exciting places. But anyway, this wasn't so bad also. I started to ask myself: 'What did you expect? Isn't that what the book told about?'<br/><br/>So yeah. I know that even you... yes, YOU, have already watched the movie. These days not many people read reviews before they go and see a movie. They usually only take a look at the star rating. So tell me your opinion. But who knows, I wish you best of luck if you haven't seen it yet :)"
"jamalashley","8","0","1","25 November 2010"," Hermione and Ron are back in center stage. Yates created another tight movie, faithful to the book and intelligible to even non-Potter fans or Potter newbies.
","David Yates is definitely the savior of the Harry Potter films. He brought magic back to Harry Potter in The Order of the Phoenix. The Half-Blood Prince was also very well done although it included only half of the book. It was obvious that at least from the third book, each book needed two films each.<br/><br/>In all the books, while Harry Potter is the title role, there are three lead characters - Harry, Ron and Hermione. But from the third film, the Ron and Hermione characters increasingly faded into the background. The directors really had no choice. They had to choose only a certain plot and subplots. They also have to accommodate the other characters, especially the stars who agreed to be part of the film.<br/><br/>The presence of established actors in a film also attract moviegoers. I probably wouldn't have gone to see the first Potter film if all the actors were unknown. The presence of Richard Harris, Dame Maggie Smith, Kenneth Branagh, Julie Walters and others convinced me that it must be a credible film to watch. The addition of good actors like David Thewliss, Helena Bonham Carter, Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson and Ralph Fiennes made the subsequent Potter films more interesting to watch. Unfortunately, by the fifth film, no established actors were added and those that remained were given hardly any screen time. Evidently, the producers felt that they didn't need any new movie-goers. The Potters fans are enough to make the films blockbusters.<br/><br/>Finally accepting the fact that the later Potter books need a 4-hour film or a 2-part film, the producers decided to make The Deathly Hallows a 2-part film. Thank Heavens!<br/><br/>With enough screen time on hand, Yates was able to bring back Hermione and Ron into center stage, as what Rowling intended to in the first place. Unfortunately, the others were merely glimpsed upon. (Why was John Hurt there?)<br/><br/>But I must say, Yates need not add more to the book. Snapes (Alan Rickman) was shown walking through closed gates. I didn't know he could walk through steel gates or walls. Only the ghosts of Hogwarts could do that. Besides, he was given such a great entrance yet totally forgotten in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I found the film a bit low key. There was not much action; or if there were, they were so abrupt. There were times when the director seemed to be such in a hurry - not giving enough time for the actors to react or the scene to coagulate, as it were. Yet there were times when there was really nothing going on. For the first time in the series, there were moments that I thought the film dragged. I suppose Yates is keeping all his guns for Deathly Hallows Part 2, the very last of the Harry Potter saga. <br/><br/>Yates created another tight movie, faithful to the book and intelligible to even non-Potter fans or Potter newbies."

Finale is a bit unsatisfying, like you'd expect since this is only the first half of the final chapter, but there's still plenty left to reward fans of the series as they're reunited with a lot of their favorite characters, and thrilled by lots of exciting action scenes, fatal escapes, and jaw-dropping effects sequences.

"Hellmant","8","0","1","23 November 2010"," Still not a 'HARRY POTTER' fan but I can always admire a well made movie!
","'HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>I'm not a big 'HARRY POTTER' fan, I've never read any of the books and although I've seen all the movies I've never been that involved in any of them. Although I'm a huge fan of creative and imaginative sci-fi and fantasy the world of 'Harry Potter' has never been that fascinating or interesting to me. With that said I do admire and respect the films for being able to capture the essence of the books (I'm told) and so effectively deliver what the fans want to see. Despite a rough start with the first two films (the poorest received by fans and critics alike) the films have gotten better and more mature, for the most part, with each installment (despite a mild setback with 2007's 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX', the next worst received of the series). It is only fitting that as the characters mature the movies do as well and this installment is by far the darkest and most mature yet; I'd imagine it's far too frightening for most young children.<br/><br/>The film is once again directed by David Yates, who has directed the last three films as well as the upcoming final chapter. The only other director in the series to direct more than one installment was Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films (and many thought butchered the job). It's once again written by Steve Kloves (adapted from J.K. Rowling's book of course) who's written every single film adaptation in the series except for 'ORDER OF THE PHOENIX', which was written by Michael Goldenberg (and is where the series faltered of course). Daniel Radcliffe (who is now 21), Emma Watson (20) and Rupert Grint (22) all reprise their roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. The film is adapted from the first half of the seventh and last book of the series.<br/><br/>The film continues the story of Harry, Ron and Hermione's continuing journey to thwart the plans of the evil Lord Voldemort (once again played by Ralph Fiennes) and save the 'Wizarding World'. Voldermort now has control of the 'Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts' and as the movie opens the 'Order of the Phoenix' meets to move Harry from Pivet Drive to the Burrow by flying him there to avoid the Ministry's detection. They also use a special potion in order to create Harry lookalikes to confuse any 'Death Eaters' that might attack mid-flight. After surviving an immediate attack they make it to the burrow with some casualties. Once there they begin preparing for a wedding during which they are again attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron and Hermione escape to central London to continue the late Dumbledore's mission of finding the Horcruxes and destroying them in order to defeat Voldermort. The problem is that once they find one they have no idea how to destroy it. Things get dismal and convoluted and the story stretches on (and it's only half over).<br/><br/>I found my mind drifting, losing interest and becoming confused on what was going on several times during the movie (as I do with all the films) but I was always visually captivated with what was being depicted in front of me. The cinematography, by Eduardo Serra, is breathtaking and Yate's directing has only gotten better and more interesting with each film. The way he handles the subtlest of character driven scenes is fascinating, as well as his adept ability to orchestrate a complex action scene. The score by Alexandre Desplat is involving but minimally used to great effect. Although I had a hard time focusing at times and felt the story dragged on too long I did admire how well executed it is and could tell if I was a fan of the material I would have been captivated. The filmmaker's obviously treat their fans very seriously and don't talk down to them at all. I like how much more mature the films have gotten with time and truly feel that they're no longer kids' films. I'm still not a big fan of the series but I can always admire a well made movie and this (like most before it) is one.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEG4WJ28XNA"

","To quote Keith Cohen: ""Non-readers and Potter virgins will be frustrated and completely lost by the confusing story."" Enough said. It is a movie that panders to the book readers. Yet for everyone else, potentially including those who have watched the other HP films as well, a lot of things are thrown by the wayside, such as character introductions, short goodbyes, and an ever-stalling narrative that falls in the middle of the too-long 2 1/2 hour screenplay.<br/><br/>I also found the cinematography to be a bit analytic and less fluid, filling the movie with weird angles and drowning out the suspense.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was pretty good, albeit the accents were rough. I also thought the visuals were spectacular and the sets were amazing.<br/><br/>Knowing what the rest of the book entails from the point of stoppage, they could have added one or two more action scenes, since I feel like the last movie is going to be overflowed with those. But, overall, I enjoyed the dialogue and storyline, but some of the directing decisions I think were flawed.<br/><br/>And in comparison to the rest of the film series, I think this movie is sort of a niche and is too far off from the others. It would be really hard to watch it in succession with the rest and keep the Harry Potter charm for non-book readers."

","This is the first Harry Potter movie which refers to a part of a book and not the whole. This may have to do with the fact that the last book of the series is quite long or with reasons of profit or possibly both. It is a good movie in general with aspects of fairy-tale, modern angst, Kafkaesque interiors and Orwellian situations, as well as poignant scenes of family relationships or even subdued and latent eroticism.<br/><br/>The main actors support their roles ably while scenes in the Ministry of Magic remind one of classic political movies such as Brazil.The sequence of events is that of the book and the choice to present the sub-plot of the Hallows of Death with animation instead of actors is I think justified.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to the numerous fans of the series although I think that for viewers above a certain age limit the myth of Potter has started to blur. It meets expectations though, what more can be achieved with such material in hand. Mind the enchanting dance of Harry and Hermione.Also the bell has started to toll for Mad-eyed Moody the auror and Dobby the house-elf, and it is just the start of the HŒølocaust that the last book contains and which we are presumably going to see in Part 2."
"ritvikbhawan","4","0","2","22 November 2010"," All the buzz of the first part is building up to what can be a fantastic finale !!!
","At the outset, I have to say that I went to see the movie with hardly any expectations as like all Harry Potter movies, the ending is always the best part, where the various disjointed characters and acts come together to create a spectacular finale. So in stark contrast, the viewer knows that this movie is not going to reveal the final symphony and that is a spoiler as the viewers know that this part will be dreary and boring; mostly due to the original script of the book. The fact that Deathly Hollows is considered the weakest of the Harry Potter series does not really help this movie. On top of that, the story meanders away from the flow in the book and leaves the viewers with a sense of Jamais Vu.<br/><br/>The three protagonists have tried to hold this first part of the two-part finale, but honestly, it becomes boring as the majority of action and the brilliant supporting cast will play their true part in the coming half. The original book script had a more prominent role for a few of the characters in the first half, but the movie script stays very close to the Harry, Ron and Hermione; almost following them in a true reality TV fashion. The book, in the early half, develops some very strong strands of narrative, which come together in the last chapter and provide a semblance to the dissonance so evident in the first half. This screen adaption has almost given those narratives a go-by and the fact that they had actors like Bill Nighy and they didn't take advantage of him is really sad. The characters in this part, though have played their part well; and most of them have been able to convey the sense of brooding and depression truly enough.<br/><br/>I feel that if the movie producers had to split the movie in two halves, they should have sat with Rowling and reworked the script so that the first part feels more complete. The ending seems very disjointed and is almost anti ‚Äì climatic. But, all this hasn't stopped this movie from grossing over $60 Million over the opening weekend. I only hope that the second part is able to bring alive the explosive finale which is outlined in the book."

","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" follows our heroes Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as they set out to find the seven objects, known as Horcruxes in the film, that will evidently destroy the evil Voldermort. It is a extremely difficult task since not only are they hidden in unknown places, but also the knowledge on how to destroy them is unknown too. There is also one more person who faces an extremely difficult task too, director David Yates. Can he possibly make a Potter movie that not only takes place out of the familiar Hogwarts and is much more dramatic still lovable to J.K. Rowling's fans? David Yates has surpassed Christopher Columbus in terms of handling the reigns with the popular series. Columbus up until now was the only one who directed more than one Potter film. The third film (Azakaban) was directed by Alfanso Cauron and the fourth (Goblet) was directed by Mike Newell. Yates, then came in and handled the fifth (Order), sixth (Half-Blood Prince), and finally this film, that has been split into two parts. The reasoning being because nothing is being cut out of the this time around. Fans rejoiced when they found out they would be getting a five hour conclusion to their beloved series. Yates has said to have brought out the maturity in the series that it needed. Under his eye, the films definitely have more of an adult feel to them. Signs of the change were present the second ""Order of Phoenix"" started with Potter's evil cousin, Dudley, finally got what was coming to him. Even before Dudley came face to face with one of the most feared inhabitants of the wizarding world, you could sense something terrible was bound to happen. Yates perfectly nailed the sense of dreariness through the flushed out colors and perfectly placed camera angles. Then in ""The Half Blood Prince"" he created a very sympathetic character out of Horace Slughorn, with the help of Jim Broadbeant. Here, he keeps the same gift for creating dread and despair. One of the first scenes in the film, a poor ex-teacher at Hogwarts, hangs in the air while Voldermort's crew discusses their next move. We know, as does she, it is just a matter of time before she bites the dust. It is detail like this that make these films establish the dark tone that Yates is going for.<br/><br/>Before I make the poor guy seem like a one-dimensional director, I will point out some of the other strong points that he possesses as a director. There are some scenes of thrilling action and creativity that are just a sight to see. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione, must infiltrate the Ministry of Magic, they drink the physical form changing Poly Juice Potion, to turn into awkward adults. This scene is a joy to watch because it is adventurous and quite comical. Another scene is when Hermione tells a wizard fairy tale. I won't go into detail about it, but it shows how much these films have taken an identity of their own. An identity that we will only get to enjoy for only 150 minutes more.<br/><br/>Grade= B"
"Eternality","7","0","1","22 November 2010"," The Deathly Hallows is as much about the fight against evil as it is about the sexual maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
","The decision to split into two parts the last installment of the most popular screen adaptation of a book series since J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is a double-edged sword. It allows director David Yates to set up what would be an exciting and anticipatory finale, an epic conclusion to the well-loved story of a boy wizard which began ten years ago. However, this very setup means that Part I naturally suffers from the consequence of its own doing, that is, it promises so much, but delivers so little. We have to wait for six months for the emotional payoff that is inevitable.<br/><br/>While it might not be fair to judge a film by watching only half of it, I would turn the tables on Warner Brothers and say that it is also not fair to charge viewers twice for what is essentially one (long) film. Happy paying fans are another matter altogether. Speaking of which, fans should approach The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 with a measure of caution. Gone are the days of fairy-tale like magic and adventure. Now, these are dark times; a war is brewing, people are terrorized, and every evil being is out to kill Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows can be classified as fantasy-horror (purist fans would baulk at this). There are a number of intense imageries that are frightening and unnerving, most of which involving a huge snake. Moreover, the frequent use of desaturated flashbacks of which the villain Voldermort has a significant presence in, are at times unsettling. Surprisingly, for a film that is more about set-up than not, there is a fair amount of action, if you understand action as protagonists being chased through the woods or engaging in not fistfights but wand duels.<br/><br/>In the context of fantasy, the visual effects are excellent, be it the black streaks across the pale blue sky symbolizing the paintbrush strokes of evil, or the glowing goat that appears to Harry in the dark woods. If there is something consistent throughout all Harry Potter films, apart from the acting of the lead trio, it is the strong sense of location. In Deathly Hallows, spectacular day shots of the vast openness are contrasted with the silent dread that accompanies night scenes in the eerie woods.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows is as much about the fight against evil as it is about the sexual maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Past the pubescent stage, the three friends now face awkward moments with one another. Ron likes Hermione, but it is not a secret that Harry also has an affection for Hermione. It would be interesting to see how Yates handles this aspect of their characters in the final film. And more importantly, what it may mean for a whole generation of post-pubescent fans learning about love.<br/><br/>SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","This part of harry potter was,as always,good on the acting,environment etc,but on a whole it was a downer. I had very high expectations but didn't meet the repo. Almost no action sequences were its worse point. 2D version has nothing to offer except proceeding in the story. This movie was only like a setup for the second part. Some scenes were like action with Nagini,breaking the Horcrux etc were worth watching.For those who have read the book,this movie becomes even more of a disappointment.For those with patience,it would better to wait till the second installment and watch both together. I loved the scene so much where the feather floated through the air when the fairy tale of the Three Brothers was being told. Also drawing style that was used during the story was really amazing. The soul of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry, Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak countryside to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part one (man that is a freaking long title sheesh!) was a good movie but did not live up to all the hype for me. I saw it opening night with my harry potter crazy girlfriend and I have seen all the Harry Potter movies before and really enjoyed all of them (just not as much as her obviously ha!) but this one was a bit of a bore to me, I know it is apparently meant to just set up the part two movie coming out next year and it is supposed to be very all action but this one bored me sometimes with all the talk and the looking into the relationships of Ron/Hermione/harry potter. I think the next movie is going to be awesome for sure but this one was kind of boring to me and it also ruined the movie a bit that I watched it opening night and there were so many annoying kids screaming and wearing annoying costumes, trying to say the lines at the same time as the characters on the screen, etc, why do that?"
"blackmambamark","7","0","1","21 November 2010"," It was good, but left me with a similar feeling that i get when i finish my appetizer
","Last year, i finally gave into watching Harry Potter. Up until then, i never read any of the books, nor i have seen any of the movies. So being somewhat of a movie buff, i did both. I want to see what this obsession is all about. What drives these fans to go absolutely crazy. So after reading all the books, and watching all the movies up until this point, i must say.....it's just okay. I don't hate them, but i don't love them. To me, they just fall right in the middle. To this day, i will never understand those damn ""Twlight"" movies, but i can understand how someone will become engrossed by these fantasy tales. They're no Lord of the Rings or Star Wars.....but they still do a decent job of keeping my interest.<br/><br/>In this review, i will not compare everything to the book, because this is a movie review, not a book report. But i will say one quick thing just to get it out of the way....this movie follows the book better than the rest, i mean, duh....it's split in two parts, how could it not be? But all those questions of ""Woah they left that out?"" will hardly be raised for all you book lovers out there.<br/><br/>Now, as far the movie.....i will say that i enjoyed it. At times, it did seem to drag on. In fact, it was very relative to the first hour of ""The Two Towers""......yes, that is both a good and bad thing. It's good because you really begin to accept the characters on a more personal level......it's bad because they keep doing the same damn thing for over an hour.<br/><br/>However the main concern of this picture is it's title....Part 1. The feeling you get after you watch this movie is somewhat relative to eating a couple of dinner roles before your main course is served. I mean sure the roles are delicious, but your just biting time until your juicy steak arrives. And the problem is, it never comes. Don't get me wrong, you leave the theater feeling very satisfied. But on a long enough time line, nobody is going say you know what guys, let's watch Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, because thats the best......no no, your just going to skip to the next one, because it has the big payoff that your looking for.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.....it will have those die-hard fanatics clawing even harder at the walls, but it will have the rest of us saying ""Um, so do we get both movies for the same ticket?"". All i can say is, it's a great setup, and all it's doing is making the finale' even more grand. But in comparing this to the others, i still like ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" the best."
"Michael Fargo","8","0","1","21 November 2010"," On the outside, looking in¬Ö.
","The Harry Potter phenomenon has been all around me. I've seen each of the films and made a stab at the first book, but after a few pages, I wasn't interested in reading further. Yet, the spectacle (and considerable hype) surrounding the films has always been a draw. But to say I have any emotional investment (or even curiosity) in the story couldn't be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Action films, particularly those with elaborate CGI content, can keep me interested. Only a few of the Harry Potter films were truly a disappointment, so walking into the ""Deadly Hallows,"" I was only there for the show. My companion, however, had seen none of the previous ones nor was he familiar with the books/story, and from his reaction (""And just where did they get the shovel?"") I'd suggest if you don't know anything about Harry Potter, you'll be¬Ölost.<br/><br/>As the actors have aged, each episode has brought a more serious tone. While much of the art direction is self-referenced from the previous films, there's something claustrophobic in ""Deadly Hallows."" There's a sense of impending doom that is very well-done. In most ""chase"" films, the characters have a chance to rest or hide and plan their next move. Not here. Danger lurks at every turn and in every shadow. That is very well reflected by the young actors, and the sense of weariness and defeat is somehow beautifully realized by the technical crew. (For instance, a short animated film is used to illustrate a key mystery, and it's stunningly beautiful and frightening as well¬Ölike a nightmare Tim Burton would have.) And in fact, this film points towards a deepening realization that evil is not just something in a children's fairy tale, but can take over the world at a moment's notice. And whether the forces of good will be able to win in the battle that's ahead, is a lesson not just for children or adolescents."

","In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the viewer is immediately introduced to the dark nature of the film. Hermione puts her parents under a spell that makes them forget she ever lived (""Obliviate!""). The Minister of Magic warns that Voldemort has returned. A teacher from Hogwarts hovers over a table, only to be dropped to her death by Snape (""Cruciatus!""). And so we begin the dark final chapter of Harry Potter, and quite possibly one of the better ones, too.<br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is now seventeen years old, has dropped out of Hogwarts. Instead of learning spells for his last year, he will be hunting down the Voldemort's seven horcruxes, or the pieces of Voldemort's soul. When he finds all of them, he will destroy them and end Voldemort for good. But the trials that await him were enough for the writer of this film to split it into two parts, a decision that was probably for the better. Part 1 of the final installment follows Harry and his friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), in his fateful journey. In this odd twist on the road movie, the characters learn about the histories of the wizarding world as well as a few things about themselves.<br/><br/>The style of the sixth Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, has carried over into this film. The visuals are even colder in this one, with a greater amount of grays, blacks, and whites. Cinematography is not the only thing David Yates, the director, relies on to keep the film moody and disturbing. Steven Kloves, the writer of the film, has chosen to keep J.K. Rowling's disquieting atmosphere by removing all humor found in the other films. His simplified version of the story has not left out the least kid-friendly sequences in the movie, these being the violent ones. Over the course of the movie, we only begin to see characters die; there are many more to come in the morbid second half.<br/><br/>While the movie is never uplifting, it is impossible not to be spellbound by some of the haunting sequences, most notably a brief but intense torture scene towards the end. The animated ""Three Brothers"" story is easily one of the best scenes in the entire Harry Potter series. Much like the anime sequence in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, it is rather risky but successful animated piece of the film. The action scenes in this one are also very well done, and possibly choreographed better than those of the other films. In Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the parts with action (although there are only a few, unfortunately) are snappy, suspenseful, and quick. Never once is it tiring to hear another ""Expeliarmus!"" shouted by Harry.<br/><br/>What is tiring, however, is the pacing in Deathly Hallows. Although Part 1 is obviously a build-up for the epically long battle of Part 2, the viewer may grow a little tired during the second act, a part of the movie that is mostly about slowing down the story to look at the psychological effects of the past seven years on the main characters. It is interesting, however, to see the strings of Ron, Harry, and Hermione's relationship coming undone. And were it not for strong character actors like Watson, Radcliffe, and Grint, the middle third may not have held up. Most of the movie plays like a taut political thriller, full of muggle intrigue and corruption, but sometimes it may movie a little fast for young viewers, although this is not necessarily a film to bring the young ones to see.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 presents some very good performances, realistic special effects, and complicated story arcs, some of which are compromised by a free-form plot structure. With the cliffhanger ending of Part 1, we move one film closer to leaving behind the beloved trio that Rowling started twelve years, an event that will be tearful for fans of all ages. Part 1 is the calm before the storm. And now for the storm..."
"andrewl-williamson","9","0","1","21 November 2010"," Very well adapted!
","A very nicely executed film, remaining true to the book where possible- although changes made from the book were usually for the best to work on film- such as the limited use of Polyjuice Potion in the film, purely because it doesn't work on-screen very well. The use of Hedwig as the trigger for Voldemort's appearance was a much more successful way than the use of a spell. Much comedy was used throughout- but mainly from Ron or Dobby, who dominated every scene he appeared in (adding much needed tension relief to the plot). Steve Kloves has adapted a much more down-to-earth feel to the Harry Potter franchise in his screen-play of the book, but could be argued that it has lost some of its younger audiences due to heavy underlying issues and complicated plot, which can be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. Saying that, they did cut lots of the unnecessary sub-plots that are in the book, but fans may miss some of these 'meaningful' moments from the it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film was very successful in adapting the book to film- especially with its superb performances from Bill Nighy and Ralph Fiennes- whilst adding its own elements to enrich the story. A must see film!"

Now, Wow I can not begin to explain how proud and happy and relieved i am of the entire cast and crew of this movie! This movie was PERFECTION!

This girl absolutely outdid herself and i for one feel that she deserves some kind of award or recognition for this, i really really think so! Hermione's character stood out MILESSSS away from the others - Ron as well, with Rupert's always perfect performance- her emotional depth and finally getting into Hermione's SKIN is just perfect, it's the Hermione we've all been waiting for. The adaptation is also perfect, or the CLOSEST thing to perfect, from all the movies in the series, HANDS DOWN.

"aviat18","10","0","1","21 November 2010"," Definitely the best Harry Potter movie till date
","My expectations were already very high with this movie & pleasantly the movie exceeded it. I am glad the movie was shot in two parts, doing full justice to the book. The director maintains the sombre mood of the book throughout the movie. The chase sequence where Hagrid and Harry escape the death eaters is awesomely shot(which makes the wait for the sequel even more painstaking). I still wish Voldemort had more screen presence. For people who have not read the book, the scenes where Voldemort is shown conversing with Ollivander & Gregorovich might be a bit confusing. But you can never expect the movie to capture the full essence of the book. The three protagonists finally get a chance to display their acting prowess. Ron and Hermione are brilliant and Harry does well too. Lots of people keep dying in the movie & unlike the 6th part, this movie gives due respect to all those events. The end is particularly heart touching. The movie kinda ends abruptly setting up things brilliantly for the epic finale. Cant wait for it anymore."

","HP 7 Part 1 is rather like the first two movies in the series: the pace often flags as the film-makers now have the time to expand the story into two parts, including much stuff that would have been cut if Deathly Hallows were a single movie. I must admit I found the movie would have been better if it had been 30 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>Saying that there is room for more character exploration here; much of the middle section revolves around Harry, Ron and Hermione on their own looking for clues to discover the location of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and it's this part of the show that's least likely to please the average cinema-goer compared to the ardent fan. It's slow, talky, and has a scene between Harry and Hermione that actually suggests some sexual tension. I have to admit I didn't go for it for a minute.<br/><br/>Some of the plot, when translated to the cinema, also feels a bit forced - Ron's explanation of how he comes back is probably the least convincing moment of the entire series so far.<br/><br/>But there's many good things here, too. Virtually all the actors from the earlier instalments make a reappearance, even John Hurt appears briefly, and Ralph Fiennes is given a little more to do here as the villainous Dark Lord. I particularly liked a splendid sequence where Harry and Co infiltrate the Ministry of Magic, now under Voldemort's control. The whole thing has a strong echo of Nazi Germany's racial policies, and there's even a sequence towards the end where Hermione has ""Mudblood"" carved into her arm. Her torture sequence isn't convincing, though, and the death of a character at the film's end is a bit of a damp squib. The animated story of the Deathly Hallows is brilliantly done, however.<br/><br/>All told, this a good, if deathly slow at times, lead-in to the final film, which I'm guessing will be more action-orientated."

","Some one has to be highly creative to come up with names like, Griffindoor. Globovitch and other similar concoctions. Hats off to Mz Rowling for crafting such characters and places. No doubt the director, Yates has done a brilliant job in illustrating the grown up Harry Potter. New jokes, New situations they get caught up in.. THe movie is a visual treat..shot in the potter movie camera style, the lord of the rings kinds..it transposes you to a new world..the full 2 nd a half hours or so u experience -mmmmmm- feeling ..the one that can be associated with something dark....yet appealing and not scary ..<br/><br/>AN out and out fantasy, it deserves credit for all the accolades...."

","This is my favorite Harry Potter movie by far and it stays as true to the book as can be expected. I wish The Goblet of Fire and Half Blood Prince had made the same effort. It's a very dark film, but it is very satisfying for a Harry Potter fan who has read all the books. It's nice to see the characters really mature and we get to see a lot of the characters from Goblet of Fire. This is not a sappy Twilight film with the Happily Ever After scenario, since the two franchises are always being compared. Every moment of happiness is hard won and it's fleeting at best. There was not a sound in the theater because everyone was so caught up in the film. Since I don't want to spoil anyone, I will leave it at this. I can't wait to see the final installment!"
"Fmobley2746","8","0","1","20 November 2010"," Potter still has the heart and soul, and not to mention the special effects, that makes the series so great.
","""Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows part 1"" was a tremendous film that was packed with emotion and heart. This movie really took the new elements that was introduced in the last film to the next level. By that I mean it was even darker than before, it had much more blood, and much more cursing. The cast members and characters have grown up with me. I still remember when Daniel Radcliffe and Harry Potter were still very young. Time flys doesn't it? <br/><br/>Of course this film had flaws, but what kept it so entertaining was the heart and feeling that radiates from it. I like the new music composer but i wish some of the old music could be used as well. I did not get too much action out of this film, for it felt like a mystery adventure that was merely and introduction to part 2 and not a full movie. Anyway, it was still great. I cannot wait until part 2."
"wolfcub7","9","0","2","20 November 2010"," Very promising! And finally they're actually trying!
","I think this is the best in the movie series so far. They didn't waste time on made-up supposed-to-be-funny unessential stuff, not even on any unessentials from the book, they didn't stick to battle scenes for too long, the atmosphere stayed nicely dark and the actors did a great job, and so on. Sure many scenes could've been done better but this movie did truly entertain me just as it is now.<br/><br/>The biggest minus in this film is that Voldemort didn't attack after Nagini in Bethilda's house, and thus they didn't show us and Harry, the flashback to the night his parents died and he himself didn't. None of this story would exist without those events and they don't even show it to us. But I must insert a question mark after this minus as they may be showing it at some later point, adapt it into the last movie. Though I can't think of any situation that could be better for that flashback that that where it should've been.<br/><br/>For once someone understood better what it should sound like to be tortured by the Cruciatus Curse! Go, Emma! All the most exciting and actiony bits were left to the last part. And that is a lot. Thus it's very uncertain what will become of the quality of it. Especially if they are going to waste time on the Epilogue. Which has been filmed twice if I've understood correctly, so they probably will.<br/><br/>I think they ended this part to a very good point and did wonderful job with the scene. (:"
"watson-james-902-282983","Null","0","2","20 November 2010"," Harry Potter at its finest
","In my opinion, this film is perhaps the best in the series yet. The reason is that it took the wind out my sails a lot more than any of the previous films. It deserved its title as being the darkest of the series - it was, without a doubt, incredibly scary. But it was also very real. Gone are the days where it was a story about magic and people learning how to use it.<br/><br/>It has been replaced by a story of war, of fear and escape. Harry, Ron and Hermione are no longer under the protective spell of Hogwarts - now they are out in the real world, where death lurks behind every corner, where even the quietest of hiding spots is dangerous, and where to be caught will mean torture and certain execution. In some ways, the film is comparable to films about war in real life.<br/><br/>And yet, I felt that it also contained a sense of comfort about it - the long scenes in the tent, with only the voices on a radio or the conversation between the three friends under the protective spells Hermione has managed to conjure up. I think the scene which really stood out for me occurred midway through the film, when Hermione, depressed over Ron's departure (and more so because she is wearing the cursed locket) is listening to the radio. Harry hears the song playing and, with perfectly captured tenderness, gently removes the locket from her neck and invites her to dance.<br/><br/>The dance the two perform could not have been done better ‚Äì a scene of warmth, friendship and innocence set against a backdrop of tension and nervousness in a world where one has to constantly keep looking over one's shoulder for fear that someone could show up at any moment and drag them off to a manor where torture and death is waiting for them. I also think that Ron's encounter with his personal fears hits home. It is in this scene where we see that his true fear is that he is unloved and unwanted, and the thought of Hermione, whom his love for was quite clear even before now, kissing Harry is just too much for him to bear. If anything, the horcrux's ability to bring out Ron's insecurities was what led to its destruction. The scene of Hermione's torture really drove through the message that the film is more than just a children's film now. The pain she endures at the hands of Helena Bonham Carter's character, Bellatrix Lestrange not only shows how evil the Death Eaters and Voldemort's followers are, but it demonstrates just how enduring Hermione really is.<br/><br/>Long ago, Emma Watson's character of Hermione Granger could have come across as an annoying and arrogant swot. But not now. Now we see a character who can endure even the worst of torture and whose audacity, beauty and supreme intelligence make for a character who will last longer than the films or the books. Rupert Grint's character of Ron Weasley, meanwhile, is a far cry from the cowardly right-hand-man. We now see a man of integrity, strength and courage who would trump every sidekick in movie and literary history. But perhaps the best character on the set was definitely Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter himself. In the old days, he was a celebrity who wallowed in the admiration of others, who was young and very innocent. Now we see a wiry and very cunning Potter, with a great strength of mind and integrity like no other. He will not go down without a fight, and who is guided mostly by his own conscience. I don't think there are many heroes who could be considered more admirable."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part 1 is the best movie I have seen in 2010, I might sound prejudiced to those who aren't ardent admirers of the series. Firstly one shouldn't compare books to movies, because if one does that, he ends up finding flaws in the movie version. This film is so different from other parts, so much better, so huge. Firstly, it was the first time that everything was outside Hogwarts, there were overwhelming moments. People tend to call these later parts Dark, which is very shallow of them. I mean of'course, it has to be dark; thats what the book is all about. Its Dark, its tough, its everything that the last one should have been and the first part of the Deathly Hallows turned out to be the same for the movie series. David Yates has been phenomenal in directing the last 3 movies, i so desperately wanna watch the last part now, i mean there is so much more to come, it will be so much better. Watching the movie was like living in it, living each and every moment of it, just like it was while reading the last book. Daniel Radcliffe was his best, Emma Watson was so graceful and brisk at the same time, Rupert Grint was good, all 3 looked so good together. Harry and Ginnie's relationship also matured but the chemistry wasn't as good as Ron and Hermionie's. Billy brought his charm, shame that there wasn't anything more left for him. I will definitely watch it again."

","I'm a huge Potter fan. Fan of the books and the films. The Half Blood Prince I was disappointed with because I think it didn't focus on the main point of the story, it just focused on a romantic comedy format (nothing wrong with romantic comedies, but thats not what Potter is all about). So I had low expectations for this film. This was the first Potter film I was quite worried about. I just came back from seeing the film with my family and I have to say Potter fans, you're in for something brilliant here.<br/><br/>The acting was much better and it kept very well to the story. It is very much like the book so far. It may not be all in order, but it still tried to keep up with the story. It even finally brings in characters from the books that haven't been in the films yet, which is great.<br/><br/>The action scenes were excellent, when the action kicks off, it definitely kicks off.<br/><br/>The tension scenes are very gripping and the emotional scenes, you better get tissues.<br/><br/>Overall this was excellent, so much better than the last film. Potter fans, enjoy. Can't wait for the second part for next year."
"campkllyrsf-1","9","0","2","20 November 2010"," THE DEATHLY HALLOWS is the second best of the series
","I was hesitant about THE DEATHLY HALLOWS at first. I was excited, yes, but reserved. David Yates kind of let me down with THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE (my second least favorite) after liking THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (my second favorite up) so much. Mr. Yates, you've redeemed yourself. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PT.1 is fantastic and is now my second favorite movie of the franchise. <br/><br/>THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PT.1 carries the descending dark tone of the series further. This movie is filled with tension and dread throughout. From the get-go the stakes are high and emotion is flaring. The pre-title scene does an incredible job setting the tone for the rest of the film. I truly felt genuine sorrow for the characters, especially Hermione. <br/><br/>The aspect of the film I really liked was the sort of genre switch from the previous films. It's still a fantasy film, but this one really feels like a horror movie at times. The way scenes are shot and set up there's a real nerve racking tension to every scene. And seeing these characters grow over 6 films the connection with them really draws a heightened sense of apprehension. Some scenes were so tense you could hear a pin drop in a sold out crowd. And the sweat on the character's forward was a visual representation of the audience's. The effects were incredible and seamless with the story. Probably the only thing that I really felt was fake was the snake in the beginning of the film, but other than that I bought every bit of visuals TDH threw at me. I'm EXTREMELY glad they didn't do this movie in 3D because I don't think the post-conversion 3D would have done any justice at all and would actually detract from the story. The movie is very dimly lit and with the light taken away with the glasses some scenes would have been nearly impossible to see what's going on if any dimmer. I hope they don't post-convert part 2.<br/><br/>There's a fantastic animated sequence in near the beginning of the third act which is gorgeous. It serves as extra exposition but could really be considered a nice short film. It doesn't come off as forced or distracting in the slightest either. It could have been weird since there hasn't been anything like it in any previous installment of the series but actually fits in very nicely. <br/><br/>There are some pretty impressive action sequences as well. All but one set piece were really well executed. The one set piece that kind of bothered me was the only real one that we see the entirety of. It's a chase through the woods and while it is very well shot most of the time, it has a few too many ""Bourne shots"" where the shaky cam moves around way too much. I understand that they're trying to put you there with the characters, but too much is too much. Aside from those occasional shaky cam shots -- which thankfully there aren't too many of -- the cinematography for that scene and all others are great. <br/><br/>Only thing about most the action is that because the main characters were vaulted out of them so quickly, we don't actually see what happens. We get a taste, but the plate is passed along and we're onto the next entree. I can't fault the movie for this, in fact I actually have to give it a tip of the hat. Some of the bigger battle moments I'm sure would have been spectacular to see, but they would have dragged down the film since the movie is very story driven. <br/><br/>While the series is now in a very dark place, it doesn't get overwhelming. It is extraordinarily uneasy at times and pretty dreadful, but it's got nice bits of very effect comic relief at key moments to lighten things up for some breathing room. The laughs thankfully don't feel at all force but rather very natural. They also really help with some pacing. Those quick moments of laughter fill in for some of the down time. <br/><br/>I heard someone who saw an advance of the film say that they thought it was boring and slow. While I can't agree, I can see how he would think so. The film does swiftly exit almost every fight sequence and there is a lot of sitting around in the woods trying to decide what to do. There is a segment of the film where there isn't a lot going on, and people who aren't drawn into the story will be bored. <br/><br/>TDH doesn't cater to non-fans. There's no flash backs, no retracing steps already taken, no ""previously on"" moments. If you've been following the movies then you're good, you don't have to have read the books (I haven't yet), but if you haven't paid attention in the previous films you may feel a bit lost. But that's the perfect way to go. This is the seventh film in a series, so making a movie for people who haven't enjoyed the first six would be a silly decision to make. <br/><br/>Being a ""Part 1"" film, it does end on sort of an ellipsis. There is kind of a climax, but not really. It is kind of like KILL BILL VOL. 1 where right when the story gets to the ""oh crap!"" point you see ""Directed by."" It was to be expected. Being a two part finale to the biggest franchise of this era, they're making it as epic as possible. There's a lot of book to include in a single movie. It feels like they filmed one movie then cut it at the half way point. It's either going to make the audience feel ripped off or make the audience extremely anxious to see the final half. I didn't feel ripped off, I'm truly excited for the finale."

"mack_scott","9","0","2","20 November 2010"," The Deathly Hallows: Part one adds fuel to the Harry Potter Fire.
","To write a review about Harry Potter is risky, as if you critic it too much then you may have the whole of the British public on your back. For years the books and films have been adopted by the British as something to be proud of, the franchise being added to the likes of fish and chips and Eastenders. Happily after watching the film I found myself relieved, as it lived up to the hype that has surrounded it for the past weeks. The last book in the series, 'The Deathly Hallows', was widely regarded as the best. It was also seen as one of the longest and most action packed. The decision was therefore made to split the film into two parts, rather than have the final memory of Harry Potter being that it was rushed. But what a decision that was, the first part left viewers drooling at the prospect of another instalment. The Deathly Hallows: Part one does not let down its true fans or the casual cinema goer, an achievement of huge proportions. To satisfy the taste of both the general public and the Potter fanatics shows that David Yates has done his job perfectly. He stuck to the book as a guide, making sure he satisfied the desires of the old fans, as well as adding enough action and drama so that any age can pop in and enjoy the experience. Personally the film has re-ignited my passion for Potter, bringing back memories of the books and of the range of emotions the series makes you feel. Sitting in the cinema and looking around at the people aged from 18 to what I'm sure was a woman in her late 70's, you could tell that to some it was just a film. But to others, it was a lot more. It was the start of the end, an ending to a series which has encapsulated the imaginations of a nation. I can almost guarantee that 90% of people in that cinema will be buying another ticket when part two hits cinema's in 2011. I think that is the most impressive thing about The Deathly Hallows: Part one. It doesn't matter who you are or how involved you are in the series, chances are you will end up watching it at some point. (Or being surrounded by people that have, and ending up knowing the storyline anyway)."

","Have followed the franchise religiously so far.. this one is better.... Really better. <br/><br/>For someone who didn't cover the final book it has: No same old running in the corridors, No picking on each others in the classrooms and No following some balls on a Nimbus 20XX. It has real stuff which is written in the book and follows it to the best extent so far. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie during the middle scenes feel real slow because although starting scenes have a lot of action involving too many 'characters' which happen to decrease exponentially during the middle and till the end they show 1 man is standing (guess who?). <br/><br/>As maximum time gets covered by The Ron, Harry, Hermione tripod rushing through forests in the hiding spots thinking and discovering ways to save harry from ""He who can't be named"" they get a good look at their situation. 2 best friends (boys) and 1 girl-friend.. Even when they walk, someone always is in 'between'. The friendship although wins it all. <br/><br/>*Harry spends most of his time putting back the pieces of Horcrux puzzle that he discovers walking down his destiny. *Ron spends all his time thinking about Hermione. *Hermione 'see-saw' between her best friend Harry and her boy-friend Ron. <br/><br/>There are many scenes in which you'd feel comforted immensely, however in some you feel helpless and paralyzed. <br/><br/>Dobby Harry's elf friend helps him a lot, and his character is one of the only few characters which are very purely dedicated to Harry in the movie. Hermione is the second most dedicated character which really did her job well helping Harry through his endeavors . <br/><br/>A must pay attention part of the movie is - The epic tale of the three brothers crossing the Deathly hallows - The Animated Sequence is super cool, and I think it's one sided. <br/><br/>The movie portrays true colors of Love(Jennie-Harry, Ron-Hermione), Hatred(Voldemort's Team), Jealousy(Ron), Friendship(The Trio), Infatuation(Harry), Honour(Dumbledore's Will), Dedication(Dobby).<br/><br/>Movie has lot to offer, is thrillingly entertaining withvspectacular special-effects. That python galloped everyone very well. However the story shouldn't have ended with our heroes looking like TOTAL DEFEATED. I mean see Dumbledore's death became very painful on Harry, which is showcased occasionally in the movie when he is shown thinking alone, seeking guidance. After his parents, Sirius was killed, and now Dumbledore too, who'd the poor guy talk to now, Hermione's all set with our superstar Ron, Harry's all DAMN ALONE, Jinny prefers to stay with her mom more than she does with Harry. <br/><br/>You wanna make a BLOCKBUSTER, first of all make sure it has a Happy Ending, or whatever.. Funny thing is, this-one already was a blockbuster even before it was titled so. I loved it anyway for so many colors it composed... Definitely gonna give it another go!!<br/><br/>I'd rate it 9/10 (Not 10 only bcoz I liked Hermione better with Harry than with Ron) a fan :)"

"the-timelord-victorious","8","0","2","20 November 2010"," A stunning film!
","I've always been a massive fan of the Harry Potter series, but I felt the series really lost something after Goblet of Fire. Order of the Phoenix and The Half Blood Prince were decent entries to the series, but they felt rather dull and uninspired. Though I found the final act of Half Blood Prince fantastic, and probably the best final half hour of the series. Now, we come to Deathly Hallows part one. My biggest concern with this, prior to the screening was the idea of David Yates directing. I personally find him rather boring, BUT with Deathly Hallows he actually hits the nail on the head. There's some really awkward moments, but overall it's more than a solid entry to the series. The reason I think Yates has made a success of this is because it's so different. It's a road movie. No Hogwarts. No Teachers. No Dumbledore. No safety. It's fantastic.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson really do give their best performances of the series. Plus, we FINALLY get the Harry Potter theme music in an action cue. Something I've always wanted to hear. The first 20 minutes are absolutely delicious, though I would've like to see more of the Dursleys. I always wanted to see the moment where Vernon, Petunia and Dudley come to an understanding with Harry. There's some really brilliant and touching scenes present in Hallows. I especially loved the scenes set in and around Godric's Hollow as well, one of the highlights of the movie for me. I really enjoyed the mini pre-titles sequence, too. Beautifully directed. It was brilliant to see Alan Rickman also, even if it was for a few minutes. Severus Snape is my favorite character in the entire series, and during his entire scene I was sitting with an insane grin on my face. I'm glad to say he didn't feel missed at all, though. The film flowed perfectly. Some reviews I read stated that they found most of the countryside stuff boring. I'm the complete opposite, I actually thought the scenes were a refreshing change from the usual Hogwarts locations. In fact, most of the cinematography was stunning.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic entry to the series, one of the best. There was some stuff the film makers decided not to include that bugged me, but they were quite faithful to the book overall, so I'm alright with it. Eagerly awaiting Part Two."
"mailabhik","9","0","4","20 November 2010"," Finally WB has made a true HP movie
","In some ways it is always tough as a filmmaker to watch the Harry Potter movies when they first come out. As a writer/director and avid fan of the books, I already have preconceived notions in regards as to how I would film certain scenes, as to how I would write certain scenes, and as to what I would cut or accentuate to make the story a cinematic reality. I didn't get to direct this movie (which that would have been a dream come true), but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a cinematically satisfying experience on its own terms.<br/><br/>The filmmakers completely dispensed with the pleasantries here. Much how they tackled the Half-Blood Prince, they do nothing to clue the viewer into this world or reintroduce you to these characters or even the storyline that was set up at the end of the previous movie. Deathly Hallows-Part 1 picks up right where Half-Blood Prince ended, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, going off on their own, in search of the seven Horcruxes, which hold pieces of Voldemort's soul; if these Horcruxes are destroyed, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can finally be killed, but what are the mysterious Deathly Hallows that our trio stumble across on their journey?<br/><br/>If you aren't a fan of Harry Potter by now, this movie is not the kind of stand alone adventure that will make you one. As mentioned, none of the characters, nor even the magical objects such as the Marauder's Map or the Locket are reintroduced to the viewer, even certain things such as as the broken mirror shard that Harry carries around with him (which was only in the book and not in the previous movies) is never explained to the audience. The filmmakers knew that the best way to free themselves to tell this story was to assume that the audience seeing these movies have already seen all six previous films and have read all seven of the books. While this may be a detriment to those who have't read the books or to your casual moviegoer, as a fan it was increasingly liberating. A.) You do not feel like you were being retaught things that you already know, and B.) It allowed the story to consistently be moving forward and not have to retread facts of the past to make this an easier movie for those unfamiliar with this story to understand.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Steve Kloves and director David Yates proved to be an effective duo again, being able to fill so many tiny details into this movie for the Harry Potter faithful, ultimately allowing the richness of the books to transcend into the realms of the movies. In particular, Yates has surprised me once more. He has grown so much as a filmmaker since Order of the Phoenix, and Deathly Hallows-Part 1 looks as if it was directed by a consummate professional at the top of his craft. Yates was able to convey so much texture with so little. Very often dialogue was never used to explain certain feelings or emotions to the audience and it was up to Yates to manipulate your feelings through the shots, and this is where he was most splendid; such as when Ron becomes jealous of Harry and Hermione's friendship, or when Harry sees the story about Dumbledore in the newspaper. And the trio of the actor's give probably their most affecting performances yet, in particular Emma Watson who has way more emotional scenes to chew on than either Daniel Radcliffe or Rupert Grint. This movie is put entirely on the trio's shoulders (with the colorful cast of supporting characters only in to throw in their token lines of dialogue) and I was thoroughly impressed with their talent and ability.The seductive beauty of Emma impressed me. The song O'Children by nick cave was also a great part of the movie. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a standard adventure movie taken on the road, away from Hogwarts. In some ways it reminded me of The Fellowship of the Ring and the perils that those characters met on the road throughout that movie; much like that movie this is only the set- up to the story in which we all want to see (a.k.a. Part 2). Ultimately, this is one of the most beautifully photographed Harry Potter movies, thanks to Eduardo Serra's DP work, and David Yates directs some of the action sequences with so much pizazz, in particular the scenes in the Ministry and when Harry and Hagrid fly through the air on a motorcycle chased by Death Eaters. So what if non-fans of Harry Potter wont understand this movie? If you haven't read these books or seen the other movies by now, then to be completely candid, why are you seeing this movie anyways?<br/><br/>I give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 a 8 out of 10!"
"savvas172007","10","0","3","20 November 2010"," That's what Harry Potter is about....
","First of all it's crucial to mention that I have grown up reading Harry Potter books. Since my 11 till now Harry Potter is an important part of my life. OK. It's easy to call me a nerd but I assure you I am not. When I first read the Philosopher's Stone I awaited to watch its movie. I admit I liked it, although many themes of the book were out... As the films were coming out I understood that the script-writer and maybe even J.K. Rowling was up to destroy all our love to Harry Potter's world. For example, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blod Prince"" was my favourite one of the series as a book, but the film really disappointed me. But, let's move on to that movie. When I was reading the epic finale of Harry Potter I was amazed and truly anxious that when it would be transfered into the big screen it may be worse than the 6th one. I WAS WRONG!!! The film kept me from the beginning. A marvelous opening sequence -even better than the book's I think-. But, I don't want to spoil it for those who have not watched it yet. Believe me though, the one quarter of the film will make you cry!!! There were some things that differed from the book (Xenophilius Lovegood's appearance, lack of Krum's argument, different way of catching Harry, Ron and Hermione in the woods) but it didn't matter. It was all excellent. I think it's the best of all Harry Potter films. HARRY POTTER MANIACS THAT'S THE FILM WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR"

","I saw the midnight release of the film, sacrificing my sleep for the night. I rarely pay full price for movies anymore, instead opting for our town's dollar theater or our 2 main chain's cheaper times, but I paid full price for this one and I would do it again.<br/><br/>I was captivated from beginning to end. I won't go into too much detail about the plot or performances; many other reviewers have already done that, and I don't feel qualified as I'm not some kind of ""movie buff."" I will, however tell you that you won't be disappointed. Yates has managed to turn a very dark, twisty novel into a fabulous, dark and twisty adventure. You can feel the sense of urgency in this film. You get the idea that this is a mission with a deadline.<br/><br/>They cut it perfectly, too. Yates and the crew left us desperately wanting more and desiring to see the fate of the Potter world. I can't wait till next summer when I plan on sacrificing $10 and most of my night of sleep again to see it first."
"sam_is_great-com","9","0","2","20 November 2010"," Exceptional compared to previous films.
","After watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows yesterday, 'pleasantly surprised' would be an understatement. I went in expecting it to be as poor as the Half-Blood Prince (missing and altering key information, butchering Dumbledore's death, etc.) and as a Potterhaed, I appreciate that I am very hard to please but this just makes the fact that I give this film 9 an even greater achievement for David Yates (who I feel ruined the previous film). The film has many touching scenes with adrenalin-pumping action and comedy as well. For example, when Hermione (Emma Watson) is tortured, her piercing screams seem to rip through the viewer's heart as well. It was an outstanding display of her acting ability. There was also the dance scene between Harry and Hermione which didn't feature in the book so it feels somewhat awkward for big Potter fans but in terms of film-making, it's outstanding. By using this dance, Yates almost seems to clear the air between Harry and Hermione, passing unspoken words between them but it also makes it clear that they don't feel 'that way' about each other. The scene in Godric's Hollow is also very good. It doesn't quite paint the picture of warmth that's in the book but prefers to seem more cold and distant which slightly reduces the shock a few minutes later. The chase through the sky (and road) at the start is truly exhilarating on the big screen and you truly feel how hectic it is. I don't wish to 'spell' the whole film out to you but these scenes aren't even necessarily the best ones.<br/><br/>There is something which I can't quite put my finger on which means the film doesn't earn 10 because no film can quite equal the book because, to me, the books were perfect but this film was close enough to the plot to be good but the best thing about this film is that even the most learned Harry Potter fans may feel prepared for the shocks but the film's ability to surprise everyone in the cinema and evoke emotion from all ages has made this film the best Harry Potter film for a long time (maybe ever). I could watch it over and over. Compared to the last film, this was truly awe-inspiring. I plan to watch it again and would tell anyone who wants a film with a wide range emotions to see it. Outstanding!"
"oli-baas","10","0","1","20 November 2010"," By FAR the best of the series so far!
","This is my first review, do please don't be too hard on me :):<br/><br/>I'll try to base this review on the aspects I always find very important in a movie:<br/><br/>Acting: Massive improvement, compared to previous films. Let's be honest, when the trio were younger, they just couldn't act (nor could we expect them to at that age), and nor could the other children. Finally, they have proved themselves to be true actors. The seniors all did an amazing job (I don't know the names of the actors, so I will use their characters' names). Although we didn't see much of him, Snape was outstanding once more. I think Bellatrix Lestrange was scarier than she's ever been, and also Lucius Malfoy did an incredible job.<br/><br/>Story: Obviously quite hard to judge, as it was based on the novel. However, by sticking to the book way better than any of the other movies (perhaps apart from the first one), they really projected the story in a way Rowling meant it (I think). I was very pleased to see that they tried to keep every element in, without taking short cuts. I mean, why the HELL was Dobby replaced by Neville, in previous movies? The excitement in the audience when we saw Dobby again was amazing (and so were the 'aaaws' and 'ooohs' when he died'). Also they decided to add Bill Weasley, an absolutely great decision. I mean why would they leave him out of the other movies? So I think that by following the book to the letter (and adding the animated tale of the three brothers, stunning), they pleased both the people who knew the story from reading the book, and the people who had only watched the movies before. <br/><br/>Humour: Although incredibly funny at some times, I don't think the jokes were spot on. I think Ron's character started to get absorbed by his jokes, and some of the funny moments were at times completely out of place. In my opinion, it just doesn't work to make a character say something funny whilst his friend is being tortured for example.<br/><br/>Overall, I think by a clear mile, this was the best movie of the series, as I think for the very first time, it is a great movie first, and a movie based on a novel second (unlike all the others). It was scary, we could all feel the same emotions as the characters (unlike for example the fourth movie where Ron's anger is completely out of order, and his way to 'make it up' is soo far fetched), reasonably understandable for people who hadn't read the book, and admittedly incredible funny at times (but as I stated, not always at the right times)."

","After the 3rd Harry Potter film I found it hard to tell the difference between the latest 3, they all seemed a bit confusing, yet that hasn't stopped me from being first in the line for every Potter film that comes out and this was no exception...<br/><br/>I read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows three times, I absolutely loved it! I was prepared to point out loads of missing parts from the new film, and I was wrong. This was utterly fantastic!! They've definitely gone up a notch in terms of quality and acting. As you probably know, the series is drawing to a close which means everything and anything is happening. I'm not going to spoil it but its definitely my favourite so far, every scene in the film was what I imagined in the book which in my case made the film arguably better.<br/><br/>I also want to warn everyone that it is quite scary and there are a few jumpy bits! I'm surprised this isn't rated a 12. (Lady next to me screamed about a hundred times, I wanted to pour my popcorn over her head)"
"classicalsteve","10","0","1","20 November 2010"," Books and Films Keep Ascending the Magical Ladder of Storytellng Classics: Most Mature Harry Potter Movie Yet
","It's hard to believe we've now been living with Harry Potter for going on 12 years for Americans, and 13 years if you're British since the first book was published in the UK as ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in 1997 and ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" in the US in 1998. In the first installment of the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I, the entire Harry Potter enterprise has literally come-of-age. The story and characters have matured along with the writer, her readers/film-goers, as well as the actors in the primary roles. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe in the roles of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter have grown up along with their youthful wizards, and the actors themselves are fast-earning the right to be regarded as A-list talent. Hopefully, they will have fine careers ahead of them, assuming they won't be forever type-cast as the Hogwarts wizard students of the Harry Potter novels. And of course, the ultimate credit of the series belongs to J.K. Rowling who has created a universe as recognizable as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, Stephen King's Dark Tower, and Anne Rice's 18th and 19th-century vampire societies.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast of ""HP and the Deathly Hallows"", aside from the young leads, comprises bona fide A-list actors who were already demonstrating the heights of their craft long before J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter in tea shops as a single mother on welfare in Britain. Ironically, the names topping the list play the villains and dark characters: Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. Special recognition has to be paid to Fiennes as Voldemort whose demonic persona makes the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster appear more like bank robbers by comparison. Fiennes, despite the warped face and absent nose, is entirely believable as the sworn enemy of Harry Potter and an adversary to all that is good in the Wizard World.<br/><br/>However the crux of the tale (as with the rest of the series), surrounds the three young leads inside an incredible production. The first couple of installments were written more for a younger age group. Now the characters and their respective actors have grown in complexity and subtlety. They reside inside the skins of their characters in ways which make you believe they understand and appreciate them more. No longer the smart class show-off of younger years, Hermione has grown into a young woman beginning to appreciate more fully the powers she has been taught which can transform the world rather than simply being the most-liked by her teachers. Weasley has a better sense of himself and is now dating Hermione which would have been unthinkable in the first few Harry Potter stories. And Harry Potter is nearing the moment when he can face Lord Vortemort as a near-equal without cringing at the sound of the name.<br/><br/>The plot of the present installment is the most complex and compelling yet. Voldemort has gained power over the Ministry of Magic who are running the wizard government akin to Nazism of the 1930's. Anyone with ""muggle"" (i.e. non-wizard) blood risks being expelled and/or subdued by high-ranking officials in kangaroo courts. They have even placed a roman-inspired relief in the wizard town square showing muggles being subdued by magic. Although the wizard ministry and government are run by mortal wizards, Lord Voldemort is pulling the puppet strings like a demonic equivalent of the Godfather. He is on the verge of gaining complete immortality through the Horcrux's, amulet artifacts which also have an interesting side-affect of making the wearer become more self-absorbed and selfish, not unlike the Ring of the ""Lord of the Rings"". Dumbledore had begun the mission of destroying the Horcrux's as a means of defeating Voldemort; the mission now is passed onto Harry Potter and his friends. Harry Potter along with allies escort him to a refuge but are immediately besieged by the soulless dementors. There must have been a traitor among them which tipped off Voldemort.<br/><br/>The three young wizards then engage in a two-fold quest: to obtain and destroy the Horcrux's to stop Voldemort from permanently gaining immortality thereby becoming the absolute-ruler of the Wizard World for eternity. Think of Adolph Hitler wielding a wand. Unfortunately, the Horcrux's appear indestructible, and they must obtain an artifact willed to Potter from the late Dumbledore, a sword, Godric Gryffindor, which Hermione realizes may contain enough power to destroy the Horcrux. During their quest, they keep stumbling upon a strange triangular symbol, which even appears on one of the stones of a cemetery at Harry Potter's birthplace which is also his parents' deathplace.<br/><br/>A brilliant and compelling film all the way around despite having been absent from Hogwarts, with absolutely phenomenal effects which neither impedes the story nor hinders the acting but enhances the Wizard World and the story contained within. The acting is some of the best I have seen for a fantasy film/story, it's only rival Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"". The best which can said of this film is that it never appears like the filmmakers were relying solely on the Harry Potter name for success. They have forged a brilliant film to climax the series, one of the best all-time in fantasy-filmmaking."
"theycallmemrglass","8","0","1","20 November 2010"," Riveting and Beautifully Acted but Incomplete
","I am writing this review from the perspective of having read all of JK Rowling's majestic chronicles. So I suppose that makes me very very far from unique. But anyway, here's my take on it: Its a thoroughly riveting, beautifully acted and tense film. This entry takes maturity to its next level to a point where the whimsical magic of previous films have now completely evaporated evolving deeper and deeper into non lit places (sorry, just trying to avoid using the much overused ""darkest episode yet"") But I'll be honest, as much as I enjoyed this film, I suspect this will be my least repeated viewing film in the series. I have watched all the previous films more than twice (and for the record I love every single film in the series including the much criticised first 2). But this one is much more slowly paced, which is not my complaint, in fact I loved the pacing, its the fact that it wraps up hardly any story thread in such a slow manner, that it its re-watchable factor is very low. Yes it is Part 1 of 2 but still, with any chronicle series, I expect at least 1 or 2 sub plots to be resolved. Here, I cannot think of any sub story strand being resolved. But I will watch it again, just not as many times as the others which offer a more all round complete package of entertainment and complete narrative.<br/><br/>There are other flaws. The main one being that there are too many elements thrown into the broth without a proper smooth narrative, so it just becomes too convoluted. There are even some important elements introduced that are just not explained at all (ex,. the mirror shard). But I suppose this cannot be helped for the sake of making sure part 2 weaves together the main threads that are vital for the grand finale.<br/><br/>But this was still a great film despite my criticisms, simply because there was so much more brilliance that outweighs its admittedly plentiful flaws. The cinematography was stunning, Yates direction superbly elegant and sublime, the score was beautifully mellow and majestic at the right moments, some absolutely thrilling set pieces, a nice sprinkle of humour and the magnificent acting by the 3 young leads simply stunned me. In previous films, the senior British stalwarts were always there to add gravitas around our young actors. But here we see the three young leads leaving the nest, and carrying this whole damn movie on their own with tremendous aplomb, each giving hands down the best performances of their film career. Nothing seems forced with them and not once do I ever feel they are acting, their relationship and expressed emotions are so believable and organic.<br/><br/>I cannot help miss what has been left out of the books but that in no way affects my rating for the film, in fact there are scenes added and changes made that turned out to be poignant and beautiful highlights of the film. So kudos to the screen writing of Steve Kloves.<br/><br/>So please roll on the grand finale of this magnificent fantasy series. The likes of which I doubt we'll experience again for a very long time."

","This was the most bizarre dichotomy I've ever witnessed on screen: On the one hand this was a wonderful sweeping narrative of our well loved friends latest adventures, characters and actors we've grown up with over the last decade. On the other hand it's an almost incomprehensible story of camping, wonderful scenery, lots of snow, some head-scratching at just why Harry is the chosen one (when it would appear Hermione is better at everything,always was and probably will be!), and did I mention the incomprehensible story! <br/><br/>So what was so wrong with the story - just such a complete lack of explanation ,who were the Snatchers ,who were they snatching and why did Harry and friends run from them,surely they were more far more powerful than 6 lackeys working for ""I presume"" The ministry. Why did Harry hide in broad daylight in the Dursley home at the start, furthermore why did he hide in broad daylight at the wedding. <br/><br/>More alarming was the time-line in the endless meanderings from campsite to campsite in some of the most spectacular scenery ever seen on screen, Ginny was seen when Harry camped out next to lake Tanganika or somewhere going back to Hogwarts for the new term: A it was supposed to be 1 or 2 days before Christmas , B she was a Weasley why hadn't she been ""snatched"" and C just how many pupils were at Hogwarts anyway without Mugbloods ,Halfbloods, and kids of good Wizards, bizarre!?<br/><br/>Also is just me or did not seem that the Elf Dobby seemed more powerful than any wizard he caught Mundungus in a nanosecond without knowing anyone was looking for him, had the second sight to appear in the basement to save the day ""unbelievable"" ,this man could save the world debt in 5 minutes never mind defeat the lord of darkness, What a guy!!<br/><br/>Also on the subject of Voldemort did someone not miss a trick when we first saw his true self 5 episodes ago, if he'd remained a shadowy figure instead of the non-scary third class Freddy Krueger then his unmasking at the end of this film especially as a prelude to the final chapter would have been genius.<br/><br/>Anyway as you'll notice from above I gave this a 10 , you're probably wondering why. At the end of the day if anything I believe the film is actually too short to explain fully all the intricacies of the storyline, but in the world we live in today 3 and half hours would have been lambasted by 80 percent of the viewers, maybe this will force more people to read the book or at least half of it as a precursor to the last thrilling instalment.<br/><br/>What I really liked was the film within a film ""the story of the Deathly Hallows"" pure genius! The characters as usual were brilliant, the acting wonderful especially Helena Bonham Carter who makes Cruella De Vil look like Annie - she is Evil incarnate, smashing. I happened to like the interaction between Harry,Hermione and Ron on there forty days in the desert adventure.<br/><br/>There was horror and humour and I defy anyone not to cry 10 minutes from the end. All in all I loved it and I hope you will too , maybe the shortcomings in the Narrative will make you think and fill in the blanks yourself ,sometimes life should be that way!!"

","Yates, in his wisdom has handled the transition from Hogwarts to the real world masterfully. The magical threesome, Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown up before our eyes and in DH their sense of isolation, confusion, triumphs and defeats feel as though we are not outsiders watching but a participant in their grief. In DH there is little to celebrate, even less to laugh at- but the sense that life is not all smiles and easy most of the time is real and that is what makes DH magical. <br/><br/>JK Rowling, a masterful storyteller, has created a world that is both extraordinary and relevant to today's audience. Harry, Ron and Hermione may use magic to solve simple problems, but there is no magical cure for dealing with loss, looking for answers and defeating evil that hunts you at every step. Luckily for the audience, we have Harry who has goodness, courage and above all love.<br/><br/>As the list of villains grows in DH it is the same core villains that are in full swing and most powerful. The brilliant Rickman is not used enough- but I know his time is coming. Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy, is masterful once more. In a particular scene you can feel the internal struggle he has for doing bad and the conflict on his face for being a Death Eater. Bravo! The villains are all necessary and add yet another dimension to what the real world is- there is no protection here for them- they are all on their own. <br/><br/>One flaw I have is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One stays so close to the book that many viewers who have not read the books (if those individuals even exist in the world) may have a hard time understanding why the long drawn out scenes in the woods and become annoyed that sometimes it seems as though this film is going nowhere. <br/><br/>The moments of tenderness, frustration and action more than make up for those times when all you want to do is reach out and hug them and say that it will all be okay in the end-"

The plot is deep, the acting is great, and this is by far the most faithful movie to the books. Overall, not the most entertaining entry due to some of the lack of action, but it is by far the best.

","For many years, we old Harry Potter's fans had been angry on the disappointing adapting of the books; a brief synopsis the action parts none of the things that made the series a modern classic or a literally work of art. As an example; the best (and longest) book; The Goblet of Fire was so badly adapted and worse directed that the real meaning of the book (youngster anguish, rebellion and sexual awakenings ) was completely trimmed. Characters and actions related to the next part where eliminated, creating a hole in relationships and even our feelings from some characters (i.e. Sirius Black). David Yates took over on the franchise but even if the adaptation was better; the movies barely reflected the books. I regained hope when I heard the movie will be shown in two parts; finally Hollywood greed will be useful for something !!!.<br/><br/>Well, the first part is really like the book. There were a few trims but the slow action and Harry's, Hermione and Ron desperation and disorientation was perfectly staged. Three almost kids fighting against the world without any idea on what to do.<br/><br/>A few people (who did not read the book), though the movie was too paced and with poor special effects. There is some true about that; but the pacing was exactly right as in the book and the special effects this time not really that important.<br/><br/>Let's hope that Yates do the right thing for the last and most expected part."

","In some ways it is always tough as a filmmaker to watch the Harry Potter movies when they first come out. As a writer/director and avid fan of the books, I already have preconceived notions in regards as to how I would film certain scenes, as to how I would write certain scenes, and as to what I would cut or accentuate to make the story a cinematic reality. I didn't get to direct this movie (which that would have been a dream come true), but Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a cinematically satisfying experience on its own terms.<br/><br/>The filmmakers completely dispensed with the pleasantries here. Much how they tackled the Half-Blood Prince, they do nothing to clue the viewer into this world or reintroduce you to these characters or even the storyline that was set up at the end of the previous movie. Deathly Hallows-Part 1 picks up right where Half-Blood Prince ended, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, going off on their own, in search of the seven Horcruxes, which hold pieces of Voldemort's soul; if these Horcruxes are destroyed, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can finally be killed, but what are the mysterious Deathly Hallows that our trio stumble across on their journey?<br/><br/>If you aren't a fan of Harry Potter by now, this movie is not the kind of stand alone adventure that will make you one. As mentioned, none of the characters, nor even the magical objects such as the Marauder's Map or the Locket are reintroduced to the viewer, even certain things such as as the broken mirror shard that Harry carries around with him (which was only in the book and not in the previous movies) is never explained to the audience. The filmmakers knew that the best way to free themselves to tell this story was to assume that the audience seeing these movies have already seen all six previous films and have read all seven of the books. While this may be a detriment to those who have't read the books or to your casual moviegoer, as a fan it was increasingly liberating. A.) You do not feel like you were being retaught things that you already know, and B.) It allowed the story to consistently be moving forward and not have to retread facts of the past to make this an easier movie for those unfamiliar with this story to understand.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Steve Kloves and director David Yates proved to be an effective duo again, being able to fill so many tiny details into this movie for the Harry Potter faithful, ultimately allowing the richness of the books to transcend into the realms of the movies. In particular, Yates has surprised me once more. He has grown so much as a filmmaker since Order of the Phoenix, and Deathly Hallows-Part 1 looks as if it was directed by a consummate professional at the top of his craft. Yates was able to convey so much texture with so little. Very often dialogue was never used to explain certain feelings or emotions to the audience and it was up to Yates to manipulate your feelings through the shots, and this is where he was most splendid; such as when Ron becomes jealous of Harry and Hermione's friendship, or when Harry sees the story about Dumbledore in the newspaper. And the trio of the actor's give probably their most affecting performances yet, in particular Emma Watson who has way more emotional scenes to chew on than either Daniel Radcliffe or Rupert Grint. This movie is put entirely on the trio's shoulders (with the colorful cast of supporting characters only in to throw in their token lines of dialogue) and I was thoroughly impressed with their talent and ability.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 is a standard adventure movie taken on the road, away from Hogwarts. In some ways it reminded me of The Fellowship of the Ring and the perils that those characters met on the road throughout that movie; much like that movie this is only the set- up to the story in which we all want to see (a.k.a. Part 2). Ultimately, this is one of the most beautifully photographed Harry Potter movies, thanks to Eduardo Serra's DP work, and David Yates directs some of the action sequences with so much pizazz, in particular the scenes in the Ministry and when Harry and Hagrid fly through the air on a motorcycle chased by Death Eaters. So what if non-fans of Harry Potter wont understand this movie? If you haven't read these books or seen the other movies by now, then to be completely candid, why are you seeing this movie anyways?<br/><br/>I give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 1 a 10 out of 10!"
"wwefreakjon","10","0","4","19 November 2010"," The Beginning of the End
","Waiting in line at 6:30 on November the 19th, I was waiting for the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; Part 1. Despite the obvious excitement, I was worried. The last two installments were poor in my opinion and David Yates (the director of parts five, six, and seven parts one and two) was still at the helm for this one. Once I left the theater the next morning at 2 AM my faith was restored. The film was beautiful and moving beyond measure. It is easily the best film of the series since Prisoner of Azkaban, and it creates great excitement for the final installment.<br/><br/>HPDHP1 is the first part of the conclusion to the series. Harry Potter knows that he has to destroy a number of magical items (known as horcruxes) before he can attempt to kill his life long enemy and the most dire threat to the wizarding world, Lord Voldemort. For those of you who have not read the books or seen the movies, this film will make almost no sense to you. Without a decent understanding of the Harry Potter series this film will be completely incoherent. However for those who have followed along, you should have no trouble with understanding the film.<br/><br/>The biggest concerns with installments five and six were that they each had one element that was necessary for the movie to be great. The fifth was missing good acting and the sixth was missing a good mood. Part seven is missing neither. The mood is set from very early on and keeps hold even when some lighter moments do arise. Those lighter moments which ruined part six, due to corniness, were wholesome and relieving. The acting which ruined part five, again due to corniness, was genuine and emotional. It brought a lot of true feeling to what could have been an emotionless film.<br/><br/>Some die hard fans will say that the film was ruined due to parts that were missing from the book. I tell you to ignore those nay-sayers. JK Rowling (the author) had huge amounts of input into this so I think you can safely assume that anything that was done, was done to make part two, the most spectacular finale you could imagine."
"blacklist-1","9","0","2","19 November 2010"," A fantastic start to the epic finale in the HP series. An almost perfect movie
","I am a die-hard Potter fan and have got and read all the books and seen all the movies made up until this point. After the good, but most disappointing of the Potter films, Half Blood Prince, I am very pleased to report Harry comes back in style thanks to terrific direction of the very capable David Yates and a mesmerising screenplay by Steve Knowles.<br/><br/>In this first part of the Dealthy Hallows, Harry, Ron and Hermione are cut off for most of the film by the magical world as Voldemort has taken over the ministry of magic and Hogwarts as Dumbeldore has left Harry the task of finding and destroying the last of Voldemort's Horcruxes. Throughout we see the trio desperately frail about trying to decide what to do next. Throughout we get the sense of the desperation they feel with the whole wizarding world literally against them. Steve Knowles has done a sensational job of keeping as close to the novel as possible and it was lovely throughout as I could follow the sequence of events from the book and know roughly whereabouts the film was up to. The narrative structure of the story is held together extremely well as mostly everything is in there for the first part of the book. Obviously there were some parts missing, but it dosen't in any way degenerate the narrative structure too much.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of this first part is the acting. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have come a long way since the Philosopher's Stone and it shows, over the series they have explored their acting abilities and I am pleased to say this part one of the seventh film is their best acted yet. Grint provides much of the comedy element of the previous films, but also provides surprisingly in depth angst as he feels alienated from Harry and Herminone when they are camping in different parts of the UK and suspects they are a couple. Radcliffe gives an excellent leading performance as the Chosen One with the whole weight on his shoulders that is pushing him down and it shows, but Emma Waston is undoubtedly the best of the three. She has matured into a terrific adult actress. She radiates the screen with a touching and very believable performance. <br/><br/>The supporting roles have to be mentioned, unfortunately Alan Rickman dosen't get enough screen time to flex out his role, but it was nice to see him anyway. Neither does Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid or David Thewlis as Lupin (a couple of parts he was in, which were cut out). Also Tom Felton as Draco dosen't get much at all or Timothy Spall as Wormtail. However those that get enough like Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour, Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood, Evanna Lynch as Luna, Toby Jones as the voice of Dobby, Brenden Gleeson as Moody and Andy Linden as Mundungus Fletcher all make the most of their moments in terms of comedy like Flecther and the Weasley twins and the rest more serious. Special mention though has to go to Ralph Fiennes at his best as Voldemort he has a delightfully frightening menace. Jason Isacc's though he only appears twice is great as a father imprisoned by the Dark Lord and wants to please him. The dishevelled look of his appearance all but communicates it, but perhaps the best supporting performances are Helen Carter as the cackling mad Bellatrix Lestrange who is superb and a real delight is Imelda Staunton as Umbridge who plays her part to devilish effect and still has the great simpering laugh. <br/><br/>You also get the notion of Harry, Ron and Hermione working together as a team, which was lost in the last film. The audience is very much attuned to the emotions of the three on their dark, lonely and disturbing journey, which is mostly full of sorrow and anger. But you get the sense they will never give up. Be warned though it is extremely dark and there are a few moments of terror, which may make you jump, though I didn't a few people around me in the cinema did. One moment I have to mention, which I particularly liked and was unexpected was the moment in the tent when Ron has left and Harry and Hermione get up to dance was very touching indeed. <br/><br/>Other positives is the music is beautiful and depicts perfectly the emotions the trio go through on their journey, the cinematography of the dark and gloomy settings is gorgeous with excellent special effects as ever with a sharp script to go with it. The pace of the film never flags and there is some suspense and tension throughout, however this is where I feel the movie went slightly wrong.<br/><br/>When it comes to the action there is little of it and it is apparent if you've read the book they cut parts out particularly the chase from when Harry leaves the Dursley's. Due to this restriction, you don't feel the full impact of emotions of what the characters are going through, which also loses some of the suspense and tension. This is why I stopped short of giving it a ten.<br/><br/>However I won't put this down too much as it is still a stupendous achievement for Yates and the rest who have done a sensational job. The first part ends at a perfect place. This deserves to be a big hit and I cannot wait for part two next July, which I know will be even more amazing. If you are a Potter fan I don't think you will be disappointed. This is definitely worth the money and time to see and will bear re seeing many times. Thank you David for doing me and lots of others proud. Roll on part two!"

","As someone who hadn't particularly enjoyed David Yates style of directing before (hated OOTP) I was slightly disappointed to hear that he would be directing Deathly Hallows, I thought he might change things around too much and focus too much on the wrong things. <br/><br/>However, after coming out of the movie this morning I was not disappointed. Deathly Hallows was awesome, definitely my absolute favourite of the franchise so far. They stay true to the book, which hasn't really been done properly since Chamber of Secrets and do well to integrate parts of the story that are important in DH but may not have been seen in the movies before. <br/><br/>A lot of it (the chase scene, Godrics Hollow, Malfoy Manor) was exactly how I imagined it to be in my head, full of suspense and actually quite scary, even though I knew what happened I was still holding my breath when Harry was trapped under the frozen lake! <br/><br/>The acting is the best it has ever been, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are superb, its amazing to see how much their acting has come along since the first couple of movies. Emma Watson especially puts in a great performance! <br/><br/>There are 2 reasons why I have given this a nine, one is that there are parts of it that are a bit cheesy, Harry & Hermione dancing anyone? The other is just that I don't want to wait eight months to see the second part!"

","When you look at the fans of the franchise, there are usually two types, the hardcore fans of the books wanting the films to live up to their expectation, and those who want it to be another great film. I believe that the latest instalment, directed by David Yates satisfies both groups of people. There is drama (with some pretty good acting from the trio), action, which is truly unique and elements of horror that as a collective make this film work.<br/><br/>The opening seen sees the three hero's leaving their homes, before setting off on the epic journey, which from the start sets the tone of the film well. Brilliantly cast Bill Nighy, as Rufus Scrimgour, warns the audience of there being 'dark times' ahead, and indeed there were. <br/><br/>The 'Seven Potters' scene added a bit of comic relief, before sending us on a whirl wind adventure into a sky battle, passing through familiar settings such as the Dartford Crossing. The scene was truly thrilling and showed the chaotic escape as I would hope many book fans would have imagined.<br/><br/>We are next brought down to earth with the fact that a number of characters have already died. During the wedding scene, drama comes to the hero's once more as the reception is sent into madness when another death eater attack ensues. I particularly liked the scene following in the cafe which came from no where into a gripping duel. <br/><br/>Some have said the pace of the film becomes rather slow during the camping scenes. I would have to argue that the director has portrayed these scenes incredibly well, with good choice of location to make the trio appear to be highly isolated. <br/><br/>So that I don't go on forever, i'll pick out some of my favourite parts. The scene in the ministry was very exciting and well paced. Don't need to say anything but creepy, for the scene with Bathilda (I was cringing from the moment she appeared on screen). One scene in-particular that i wasn't expecting to be so well done was the destruction of the locket scene. It was visually very impressive and innovative. Finally I loved the Malfoy Manor scene, where we see Dobby save the day. This then leads us to the saddest part of the film which was the death of little Dobby which was touchingly acted.<br/><br/>In terms of criticism, I would have to say that the end of film did seem to come out no where, and caught me by surprise. It felt a tad rushed after the previous scene. With the nature of a book adaptation, there didn't seem to be any character development of many of the new characters who appeared and disappeared before an audience could get to grips with who they were (Bill Weasley, Rufus Scrimgour, Aunt Marge are a few examples)<br/><br/>As a whole, loved it, cant believe how long we have to wait for the finale, but seeing whats left in the book for the last film, its gna be one hell of an ending!!!"

","I thought that they couldn't fit enough detail into this movie to keep it true to the book, but they did. It is the closest Harry Potter movie to the book so far. The ending was at a perfect spot as well because it left you wanting more yet satisfied at the same time. Some scenes are almost exactly as I envisioned them in my head, so props to David Yates. The most exact scene from book to movie was probably when Harry has to dive in the pond to fetch the sword of Gryffindor and Ron must save him. I thought I must have scene that scene of the movie somewhere else, but I haven't which is great for Harry Potter fans. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie without at least some prior knowledge of the Harry Potter characters, which you can accomplish by asking any friend who is moderately well versed in the world of Harry Potter. This movie has perfect flow as well, simply superb."
"munchkinsrsweet","7","0","1","19 November 2010"," All in all better than the other movies =]
","Having been a fan of the books, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. For those who have never read the books it will be a good movie, slow at places but worth seeing. However I felt when watching the movie there didn't seem to be reasons for what they were doing, they just seemed to automatically know things, such as Gregorovitch was a wand maker. Also I thought an important part of the book was that Voldemort's horcruxes were in objects owned by the founders or that they were in places that were important to him/been to. This movie they seem to be groping in the dark and they keep repeating that the horcruxes could be anything? It just seems strange as how would they be able to find anything if they didn't know anything about them or any idea what they could be? Again with the added scenes, they could have been replaced by some scenes that they missed out in the book maybe? I mean from that movie it almost looked like Harry had feelings for Hermione. In saying all the things that was wrong with the movie there were many positive aspects as well. The movie portrayed the desperation and despair that the world was after the ministry has fallen and Voldemort has taken over. The scenes when they go to the Ministry and at Godrics Hollow were really good and the scene with Dobby at Shells Cottage was extremely well done after being such an important scene in the book, the movie did it justice. Overall the movie was worth seeing and I can't wait to see the final movie of this fantastic series...shame we have to wait till next summer for that!!!!"

","When I first heard that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was to be shot in two movies, I was very glad. There is just too much in the book to condense into one movie, unless one makes a 5 hour movie. I have loved the casting for this series from the beginning, watching Harry, Hermione and Ron grow up has been a treat. I have read, more than once, all the books and Deathly Hallows is my favorite, and the movie I just finished watching is a credit to the book. Yes, there are changes, some threads (minor) missing but the spirit, the atmosphere, is all there. I particularly enjoyed Rhys Ifans portrayal of Xenophilius Lovegood, quite believable. The photography was outstanding and the apparition scenes fantastic. They came across better on screen than they did in my imagination. I keep reviewing the book in my mind, looking for a flaw or an error in the movie and I can't find one. I recommend this movie and am eagerly awaiting the second part."
"v-chennai","8","0","4","19 November 2010"," Magic is might, but there is something better than magic.
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a two-part epic fantasy film directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and based on the novel of the same name by J. K. Rowling. Just saw this movie today. And I have to say this movie is definitely good, and also it entirely varies from the previous parts and it has been directed in a satisfying manner by David Yates. It is wickedly humorous, funny and dark at the same time. But the main difference from the other parts is that this movie is really slow paced. This movie is the darkest than the previous ones, because Lord Voldemort has regained his power and is deadly than ever. Harry ,Ron and Hermione are the only hope. There is no more Hogwarts in this chapter. All the three are grown up. They have to find their own way in the world to destroy the 7 horcruxes. <br/><br/>The best thing in this movie is that there is something better than magic, unlike other parts. That is friendship and affection.<br/><br/>The part-1 has laid a strong foundation for the last chapter of this epic fantasy movie series. So Just Watch it and You will love it."
"kindigth","Null","0","1","19 November 2010"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1
","I recently attended a midnight screening of David Yates's latest Harry Potter film with my younger sister and her friend, both girls age 11. The two sat enraptured throughout, and walked out of the theater with a nearly full tub of popcorn. ""Hmm,"" said the friend, looking at how little she'd eaten, ""I guess that wasn't really a popcorn movie."" She said a mouthful there.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is worlds away from Chris Columbus's charming children's films, both in tone and impact. Where the series began in light ooh-look-at-that fantasy, it now accepts the wizarding world as established and takes its stories and subjects seriously. This means that those uninitiated will likely be very confused, but who cares. Deathly Hallows 1 exists as a bridge between the six films proceeding it and the one to come; there is perhaps limited narrative potential in that purpose, but there's plenty of room for character, exposition, and style.<br/><br/>These three functions offer mixed returns. In terms of character, I do feel that any realistic appraisal of the film must acknowledge a certain amount of sketchy dialog and strained conversational rhythm. This can occasionally be distracting, particularly as the three protagonists' interactions dominate the film's second act. The best developments on the character front come in Hallows's subtler moments; Emma Watson's Hermione is afforded a heartbreaking opening only alluded to in the source material, and Yates allows Rupert Grint's Ron to carry much of his performance in sustained emotional gazes.<br/><br/>In terms of laying out exposition for the series finale, Hallows delivers about as well as it can. As I was already familiar with J.K. Rowling's novels, I can't be entirely sure how understandable this will all be for the film-only crowd; some things are intentionally not yet explained, others may simply be unclear--I knew what was going on so I can only speculate. One block of exposition that I had been dreading actually turned out to be a highlight: the story of the Three Brothers is accompanied by a lucid sequence of stylish animation; it offers effective visual interest without disrupting the film's tone.<br/><br/>In fact, it is in the film's style that it truly exceeds expectations. Yates, as mentioned earlier, takes this story seriously and photographs it as such. The film's effects are rarely ostentatious, and when they do tend toward spectacle, the grandiosity is earned from Hallows's quieter passages. Yates mostly commands the camera as a tool of framing and focus, which lends the film a maturity of form to match its more mature content.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 will please its fans and most likely baffle everyone else, but whether one is familiar with the books, the films, both or neither, this is a solid, serious, and stylish entry in the series. Its effectiveness will be best judged when Part 2 arrives to ideally validate the work done here, but until then this film exists as an unexpectedly compelling placeholder. To those in it for long hall, Part 1 comes highly recommended--just don't expect to eat much popcorn. -TK 11/19/10"

","The latest installment of the Harry Potter series has many good elements including cinematography and humorous moments but it feels as though the balance is off and often it can be seen as bland, boring, or out of place. There needs to be a balance on all sides and I found myself questioning whether or not it could be achieved.<br/><br/>I would like to begin with the review by talking about the acting. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), and Rupert Grint (Ronald Weasley) have matured in front of the audience over the years. That, however, does not mean that they are exempt from criticism. At certain times they do give it their all and you can almost feel the passion that they are exerting. The next scene can be entirely different in that they seem like they want little to do with the film and are acting only so that they can move on. The marvel of cinema is that you are supposed to allow yourself to believe that these people are not actors; they are the characters that they portray. This is the first film that has fallen below the standards. In their defense though an actor is only as good as the script he is working with, leading me into the quality of the writing.<br/><br/>While not taken verbatim from the book there are a number of scenes that play out almost entirely like the original story. I understand that writers and directors add their personal artistic liberties and this is a movie that can do it well despite having to change details due to the errors of previous movies. I have heard other reviewers saying that this film is very close to the book. I can debate that as there were a decent number of elements/encounters/details that were completely overlooked. They did have the common sense to point out the inconsistencies on occasion (partially breaking the fourth wall). Still, the timing and pacing of the script felt either really rushed or too slow and/or unnecessary.<br/><br/>Next is the music. Unfortunately there is not much to say about it. This film seems to rely on the lack of music as a means to heighten tension or awkward feelings. While this technique has been used in other films successfully in the past Harry Potter has always been a series that uses a grand musical score to evoke emotions. This one, not so much.<br/><br/>Overall I am sitting on the fence for this film. The one suggestion I have is that if you are a Harry Potter fan then it is worth watching at least once. If you are a fan of the book, be warned that you should keep an open mind to the changes that have been made. It may make the difference between loving it or hating it."

The visual effects are stuning and the movie has everything: drama, lots of action, horror and comedy. I really liked the end of the movie it left everyone in suspense.

"jdesando","Null","0","3","18 November 2010"," Potheads should be happy.
","For the first part of the seventh film about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, potheads might feel a little smarter as the intrepid trio is getting older and a tad wiser themselves. For me, a cynic about any series going beyond three, I was pleased to see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Wattson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) pursuing death with a vengeance and doing some philosophical reflecting. In fact, it is as much an affirmation of life as it is obsessed with death. <br/><br/>Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is so strong now that Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic are under his power. The trio tries to find and destroy Horcruxes, which are shards of his soul, so as to destroy him. The usual explosions, magic horses, and all sorts of wild things inhabit the landscape as they have in the past six episodes.<br/><br/>What's slightly different here is that sex and death are major players, and not necessarily in that order. Sex to the extent that the stirrings of the three teens are a constant challenge with Ron on the losing side (at least the pubescent longings of the sixth have passed, a virtue unknown to the Twilight series). Death to the extent that they seek the Dark Lord's death and acknowledge parents' passing as well as those who die so Harry may live.<br/><br/>Director David Yates still stretches scenes beyond what even Rowling may have envisioned, and he still fails to enliven Harry beyond his constantly benign befuddlement. But this time he has given depth to characters commensurate with their growth and intelligence. <br/><br/>No magic there, just living."

","I think it is really tough to rate this movie. The problem is, even so this movie covers pretty much two thirds of the last book, you still have to leave the theater within the development of the story. In spite of the lord of the rings, i cant see this movie standing on his own and you cant judge a movie without having seen act 3.<br/><br/>But lets try, for whats its worth.<br/><br/>For the first time (IMO) David Yates (or any director at all) treated the story like it was supposed to be. A serious drama for grown ups. So this movie is really not about a fancy magic world or countless jokes - People die in this movie! There are some great laughs and some even greater action scenes / fights BUT David Yates used them really carefully and did a good job concentrating on the emotions and feelings of all those characters we have known, cared, and loved for all those years. This movie really is about what has happened over the last years - where those characters came from, what they have been thru - and of course it's the set up for whats about to happen (next July).<br/><br/>I could tell you Harry and Hermione dancing hand in handy is probably on of the best scenes of the movie, but you wouldn't understand.<br/><br/>I could tell you watching Dobby die is probably the most dramatic scene in harry potter movie history up until now! - but you wouldn't believe me. I actually had to cry.<br/><br/>The way David Yates created this movie works, because of the connection we have made over the last many many years, to our fav. characters. The movie builds on this very connection. So don't go to see this Movie if you're not a fan. Go out and buy the books ;) I wont talk much about CGI, acting, directing etc. because it is simply great... After all it really depends on the final chapter and the final movie. This one was just exposition. Yates did his job, but now we have to wait and see what it was good for."
