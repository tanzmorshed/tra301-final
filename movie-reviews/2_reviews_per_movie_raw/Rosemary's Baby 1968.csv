","One might argue Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film, since it lacks almost everything you'll find in almost all of them: shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers, even blood. The most graphic scene is a nightmare sequence that displays a rape scene so stylized it isn't actually disturbing. But one might also argue that Rosemary's Baby is a horror film in its purest form, since it doesn't depend on all those gimmicks to create its atmosphere. I prefer the latter point of view. <br/><br/>So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day. <br/><br/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner (Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight, a visiting friend observes), and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying. <br/><br/>All this is told by Roman Polanski in the perfect tone; the mood for the entire film is already set during the opening credits when we hear that weird lullaby, sung by Mia Farrow. And a lot of strange things happen throughout the entire film: Guy and Rosemary are told by Hutch, a friend of theirs, about the horrific past of the house they're now living in, a young girl that lives with the Castevets commits suicide (really a suicide?), Guy, an actor, gets the role he wanted so badly after the contestant who was originally supposed to play it turns blind, and Hutch, who might have found something out that would help Rosemary, suddenly is in a coma and dies three months later; all these (and a few other) events are precisely dosed by Polanski to draw us more and more into the film, while he makes sure on the other hand that the film doesn't become absurd. And he manages to give the film an ending that works, makes sense and is observant, slightly (but only slightly) funny and very disturbing, all at once. <br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby also contains two of the most memorable performances ever: Mia Farrow is haunting as Rosemary Woodhouse. She looks like she is physically suffering from her pregnancy and close to complete despair. And Ruth Gordon is amazing as the curious Minnie Castevet, always friendly, but also giving you the feeling that, hidden behind her generosity, she actually follows her own, obscure motives. If you have a helpful elderly female neighbor, you'll see her with other eyes once you've encountered Minnie Castevet. So, if you think a real horror film needs shock moments, vampires, werewolf, serial killers or at least blood - watch Rosemary's Baby and you'll change your mind."
"Vince-5","Null","212","244","2 May 2001"," One of the ultimate horror classics
","Every bit of acclaim that Rosemary's Baby has earned is totally deserved. The Dakota, located at 72nd and Central Park West, is the perfect setting for the demonic events; all that rich Gothic detail in the heart of Manhattan provides the perfect atmosphere, serving as a dark fairy-tale world of its own within the modern setting. Roman Polanski knows this and utilizes it brilliantly, opening the film with stunning aerial shots of the skyline and focusing in on the ornate castle amongst the skyscrapers and tenements.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, particularly Mia Farrow, who is the only person I can envision as Rosemary. Her fine-boned fragility makes her the ideal target for terror. She goes from obliviousness to suspicion to fear to near madness without showing a seam, and we as the audience are with her all the way. And Mia is given a run for her money by the delightful Ruth Gordon, a comical yet sinister presence popping in on a deliberate schedule with pale green drinks and sandpapery advice. She's scary because we know her--a batty old broad with a seemingly sweet nature beneath her caustic surface. That such a person could possibly be a vessel of evil is a thoroughly unnerving concept.<br/><br/>Unnerving is the proper adjective for the entire movie. Unnerving, eerie, and penetratingly frightening in a very subtle manner. The subtlety is key, since a more explicit treatment would've spoiled everything. As the tension heightens, we feel what Rosemary feels: Curiosity, then vague suspicion, then paralyzing terror at the final revelation. At all times, the movie retains its dignity, from the opening and closing shots of the building to the flourishing title script to the beautiful music. Even on TV, this picture can chill you to the bone. The best big-budget horror movie of all time."

","When people talk about perfect films I don't actually know what they mean. Perfect for whom? Perfect compared to what? I think that perfection is in the brain and heart of the beholder. ""Rosemary's baby"" is a perfect film to me. Scary in a way that makes you breathless. You're thinking and feeling throughout the film. One of the many sides of Polanski's genius is to suggest. And what he suggest is so monstrous that we don't want to believe it, but we do. The characters are so perfectly drawn that there is no cheating involved. John Cassavettes's superb study in selfishness and egomaniacal frustration is so real that comes to no surprise that he could do what he does to advance his career, but we are surprised, we're horrified. The spectacular Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are not Deborah Kerr and David Niven, are they? So that they turn out to be what they turn out to be is totally believable, but Polanski presents it in such a light of normality that you can't believe it. Mia Farrow's predicament is as classic as the boy who cried wolf tale and yet, as told by Roman Polanski in the wonderful face of Mia Farrow, is as if we're hearing it, seeing it and living it for the first time. Every silence, every voice in the distance, every door opening. Your heart is always in your throat. There is something there that accelerates a constant state of dread. Very few movies have been able to take me to that place, most of them by Roman Polanski, what about ""The Tenant"" or ""Repulsion""? Other movies that come to mind: David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" and Martin Donovan's ""Apartment Zero"" But ""Rosemary's baby"" stands alone as a terrifying masterpiece."
"Lechuguilla","9","83","96","25 November 2007"," A Veneer Of Normalcy
","It starts off like one of those 1950's Doris Day movies. Young, idealistic Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and new hubby Guy (John Cassavetes) move into a Manhattan apartment building called the ""Bramford"". Throughout most of the film we, as viewers, see and hear what innocent Rosemary sees and hears. There's a veneer of normalcy at the Bramford that belies what's really going on, behind our backs. It's the script's POV, therefore, that makes this film so chilling.<br/><br/>At the Bramford, which has quite a colorful history, you can hear through the walls. And, as Rosemary and we viewers soon find out, strange people lurk in other parts of the building. The strangest of all are Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon), superficially cordial, but a bit too inquisitive. Roman is retired. His wife, Minnie, wears tons of makeup and pawnshop jewelry, and gushes with praise for herbal cures, especially something called tannis-root. And Minnie's friend Laura-Louise (Patsy Kelly) wears thick glasses that make her eyes seem to bulge, and she talks with a strangely deep voice.<br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of the great thrillers of all time. Given the underlying subject matter, can you imagine how this film must have come across to viewers in 1968? The strength of the film is the script, which through its plot and dialogue implies and suggests. Not until near the end do we, like Rosemary, find out the presumed truth. Suspense increases toward the end as Rosemary ventures into the inner sanctum of the Bramford.<br/><br/>The film's acting is great, and reinforces the strong script. I particularly liked Ruth Gordon, with her delightfully eccentric behavior and mannerisms. Production design and especially costumes are lavish and colorful. Clothes and hairstyles, as you would expect, are very 1960ish. Visual effects are minimal, and are used to enhance the story, not be the story.<br/><br/>Given the film's POV, the story is rather subjective. Its interpretation is based on Rosemary's perceptions, images, and fears. One could explain that Rosemary suffers from delusions. Or, alternately, one could explain that what happens is real. It's all in the interpretation. Either way, it's a great movie. It holds up well, forty years later, a tribute to its writer and director, Roman Polanski."
"Spleen","10","178","218","21 April 2001"," Reassuring to fine it's every bit as good as its staunchest champions would have you believe
","Why aren't the horror directors of today as careful with their scripts as Polanski was?  Not that this is really horror.  Horror as we know it came into being with the slasher flicks of the late 1970s and early 1980s; ""Rosemary's Baby"" is rather the kind of thing that the term ""dark fantasy"" was coined to describe, by people of taste who noticed that the word ""horror"" promised audiences something distinctly unpleasant and nasty.<br/><br/>The film's construction is marvellous.  Things start slow - one beat, so to speak, to a bar - and gradually pick up speed so that by the end we are nervously tapping out semiquavers with our feet.  Polanski also understands the gentle art of hint-dropping.  Many events are filed away as tiny puzzles to be solved later, and they ARE solved later; others we don't attach any particular significance to at the time Polanski invites us to re-interpret in retrospect, AND chooses the right moment to let us do so.  And then, at the end, AFTER we've worked everything out, he presents us with a surprise - a delightful, gratuitous twist which nothing had prepared us for, which we couldn't have guessed, yet which doesn't cancel out the story as we'd understood it.  (Alas, many people know what this surprise is in advance. I, for one.  Yet this foreknowledge did nothing to spoil my enjoyment: a sure sign of superb construction.)<br/><br/>All in all, a film that tempts you to rank it with the best ever made - which is more, but not much more, than it deserves - simply because it's perfect.  Everything went right.  Rosemary is a wonderfully sympathetic heroine, powerless without being passive, largely ignorant of what's going on around her without being at all stupid, and Mia Farrow makes you care deeply about her.  The cinematography is pellucid; the art direction is subtly right; there's also a fine, odd yet tuneful, musical score.  I can't believe I waited so long to see this."
"alvinatth","10","162","199","4 September 2007"," Flawless Horror Masterpiece
","Rosemary, in Mia Farrow's performance, is so immediately recognizable that everything that happens to her, happens to us. Her explanation to Dr Hill (Charles Grodin) about the absurdity she's at the center of, is so brilliantly written that she becomes more than just one of us, she becomes us in all the depth of our unspoken fears. To see this film in 2007 is really amazing. Perfection! And that for our benefit. Polanski is not one of those directors who concocts camera tricks to feed his own ego. Everything is at the service of the story. John Cassavettes is a scarily convincing weakling with an ambition bigger than his talent. Ruth Gordon got, what I, in my modest opinion, consider one of the most deserving Oscars in the history of the Oscars. Her performance is beyond superb. Okay, I'm running out of superlatives but let me finish with one more...Roman Polanski is the greatest."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","37","43","2 March 2009"," Rosemary's Fight
","Polanski successfully sets the tone right from the beginning as the strange and somewhat scary lullaby plays as the opening credits appear. In the background we see Rosemary's neighborhood while the focus is on her window. This tone is maintained throughout the entire film. The film is quite well executed. Polanski creates a gloomy, isolated and chilling mood. 'Rosemary's Baby' is a horror film but unlike most movies of this genre, this one is very subtle and is more dependent on the atmosphere rather than the 'horror creatures'. It is only in the excellently executed nightmare sequence, which is comprised of fragments of scenes, that one witnesses something 'out of the ordinary'. I was initially dissatisfied by the ending but after some thought, I couldn't think of a better more effective conclusion. The ending itself is so spine-chilling and makes the movie experience more horrifying. The haunting lullaby replays in the end capturing that moment of horror like a photographic memory. The cast does a fine job though clearly this is Farrow's film. Mia Farrow is spellbinding. The way she captures Rosemary's kindness, agony, anguish, fragility and courage is noteworthy. She is simply amazing to watch. I can understand why it is still so popular after 40 years. There has been hardly anything else like it."
"nycritic","10","71","87","13 March 2005"," The Horror Underneath a Pregnant Woman's Belly.
","Pregnancy is the time in a woman's life that, despite the hormone imbalance and the emotional changes, is charged in an overwhelming among of love and support and the notion that she is slowly gestating a human life, male or female, a child that will bring her (and her family) happiness. Motherhood has been depicted as beautiful, symbolic, Woman being Creation in progress in ancient cultures, a Thing to venerate and respect and even worship, Something capable of ensuring the continuation of a family line, a tradition, and hence, life and culture for an entire strata of society. Nothing is supposed to go wrong, or at least, not at the level of what happens to Rosemary Woodhouse's pregnancy, which is the ultimate wrong thing.<br/><br/>What Ira Levin seems to want to tell us in this ""plot"" surrounding Rosemary's pregnancy is that society and its religious tradition can be substituted by something much more sinister, as-yet unseen but gestant -- the force of will, the creation of Man's own version of what he believes will be the new wave of humanity. Is God dead? Well, considering the timing of the novel and the movie with society's disillusionment with Establishment, the onset of Vietnam, the loss of innocence of a country just years ago with the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, He just as well may be. Religion and religious figures pop up during the movie, but seem unable to bring any comfort and only add to the vague sense of unease that permeates ROSEMARY'S BABY.<br/><br/>And this nagging unease is precisely what both author and director give us: something not quite, completely there, something that seems to be happening just off-limits, barely overheard through the flimsy walls which divide these prewar apartment buildings converted into chic, livable spaces. The way the banal elements that are so much a part of our lives are overthrown so subtly makes the horror that is the movie's denouement even more tragic. Surely the nice neighbors can't be more than just that -- they're so helpful... well, maybe a little too helpful. Surely the death of that girl Rosemary befriends was just a freak suicide. Surely the doctor's recommendations for Rosemary are the best -- don't doctor's always know what's good for us? And surely, one's own partner would not have done the unthinkable in order to advance professionally now, would he?<br/><br/>Paranoia of the unseen is a powerful way to tell a horror story without ever giving away any shock cuts or showing the boogeyman. While it becomes abundantly clear early on that this is a story of witchcraft of the worst kind, the only time some of it makes its way in front of the camera is in the extremely stylized ritual/rape scene, and even then, since Rosemary is having what might be the worst nightmare of her life, one isn't quite sure of what is happening, and of course, in the end, when all is revealed in a comic yet horrific way. That takes skill in a storyteller and what makes ROSEMARY'S BABY so completely disturbing even now, almost forty years from its release unto the public. Also the fact that it never relies on a twist ending so common today but on the nuanced performance of the actors portraying real urbanites enhances: from Mia Farrow who carries the movie and even at the end retains a resigned innocence to her fate once her suspicions are facts to John Cassavettes who plays his part slimy straight, and supporting actors Ruth Gordon and Sydney Blackmer who have the hard task of making kindly and eccentric hide sinister just underneath. Their performance makes you wonder who exactly are your neighbors, and if they might be harboring some deadly lifestyle, and makes you feel uneasy being alone even in an empty hallway or accepting anyone's offered smoothie."
"haristas","10","106","133","1 November 2002"," A Landmark Horror film
","""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of the best horror films ever made.  This isn't because it's going to scare the pants off you with a series of sensational jolts.  This isn't the shallow, gimmicky kind of horror movie we mostly get these days, and it isn't the traditional old-fashioned horror film of an earlier era.  This is a movie that came out during a period of transition in Hollywood.  The old production codes were breaking down and films could suddenly be more true to life in the way they showed how people really lived, acted and talked.  1968s ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a more sophisticated, less elegant thriller of the kind that Alfred Hitchcock patented, but it displays much more class and intelligence than the horror movies that would come out in its wake.  Popular '70s films such as ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" are the prodigy of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but offer far less nuance and much greater vulgarity.  What we get here is a more naturalistic depiction of modern life, but without the crassness that would soon explode into American cinema.  <br/><br/>Most of the credit for what makes ""Rosemary's Baby"" such a successful film goes to Roman Polanski.  Polanski is a master at conveying to an audience not just a sense of the uncanny but a vivid depiction of it.  His earlier films like ""Knife in the Water,"" ""Repulsion"" and ""Dance of the Vampires,"" display the talents that would come to such a controlled mastery in ""Rosemary's Baby.""<br/><br/>Polanski very faithfully adapts Ira Levin's novel to the screen so that the viewer is, just as the reader was, free to interpret the eerie events of the story as either reality or a depiction of an isolated woman's decent into madness.  At the same time the picture can be taken as a black joke on the human male's fears of the changes a woman goes through during pregnancy, both physically and emotionally.  But Polanski seems most interested in presenting a normal world, in this case Manhattan in the mid 1960s, and then through subtle cinematic techniques get an audience to actually believe that the hysterical, fantastic ravings of the heroine could be true.  It is this tour de force exercise in suspension of disbelief that makes the film a classic.  The horror films that have come since have had to ratchet up the shock effects in order to thrill more desensitized audiences, but this deliberately paced film reminds us of how much better it is to leave things to the imagination of the viewer.  That is where films really come alive and remain so.<br/><br/>The Paramount DVD presents an excellent print of the movie that looks as if it were shot yesterday, along with extras that include new interviews with Polanski, executive producer Bob Evans and production designer Richard Sylbert, and a featurette from the time of the film's original release that really works as a good time capsule."
"Steffi_P","9","40","48","26 November 2006"," ""Awful things happen in every apartment house""
","Rosemary's Baby was originally proposed as a project to Alfred Hitchcock. He turned it down, and instead it fell to the up-and-coming Polish director Roman Polanski. It's hard to imagine what the master of suspense would have made out of this tale of devil worship and Catholic guilt, even though there is some Hitchockian psychology and mystery at work. As it was however, it proved to be right up the young Polanski's street, taking his career to new heights, and spawning a run of occult horrors in the late 60s and early 70s, of which this is still one of the few greats.<br/><br/>Polanski had already established himself as a director most comfortable with the confinement of interiors in films like Repulsion (1965). Here he draws us right into the claustrophobic feel of the upstairs apartment, often placing the camera in a room adjacent to the action, with the characters viewed through a doorway. The camera movement is mostly restricted to pans. It rarely tracks or dollys, as if it were trapped in a corner. Even in the exterior scenes the sky is often sandwiched or blotted out altogether between the buildings rising on either side. The actors often appear uncomfortably close to the camera, but not in individual close-up shots. Instead, they come in that close as they move around the set and the camera pans back and forth. Not only does this add to the cramped, awkward atmosphere, but this constantly changing distancing of actors within a single shots makes the audience feel as if they are actually standing there.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby may come across as very slow to some viewers. 140 minutes certainly is a long time in the horror genre. There do also appear to be a lot of unnecessary details in the dialogue  we get to find out far more about Rosemary's background than is normal for a character in cinema. But for one thing, Polanski was not interested in making a shock-and-gore horror  Rosemary's Baby is all about the eerie atmosphere, the tension and the mystery. He holds our attention by regularly dropping in clues that something sinister is afoot. Furthermore, all the detail and depth has its significance in the finished product  like the references to Rosemary's Catholic upbringing or the background of the Castavets.<br/><br/>Polanski has never overused flashy techniques  no fast editing, zooms or unusual angles that make for a very obvious directorial style. But there is always great complexity and meaning in the look of things  the set design, lighting, costume and so on. One of my favourite touches is Mia Farrow's extremely short Vidal Sassoon hairdo that she has done halfway through the film. With her bony features and pale skin she more and more begins to resemble a skeleton, especially under the carefully placed lighting in the scene after the party when she realises the pain has gone. It's simple yet significant ideas like that which make Polanski one of the best directors of his era.<br/><br/>There's some great casting in this picture. Careful choice of character actors makes for some quirky supporting roles. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are perfect in the lead roles. The musical score  that haunting opening melody, or the atonal violin squeaks  all add to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is a real landmark in horror. It helped keep the genre alive by pushing the occult - something fairly taboo, and not fully explored in cinema since the days of silents - to the fore. Also the restrained atmospheric horror was doubtless influential, particularly on Kubrick when he came to make The Shining. It inspired a lot, but was rarely bettered."
"chimera3","10","24","28","15 September 2017"," An Authentic Classic
","I forget exactly when I saw this movie but I will say this: I was a kid when I saw it, quite literally, maybe 9 or 10. My mom spoke very highly of this movie and actually sat down with me to watch it way back when. She told me a few things here and there while we were watching it but I wanted to see it for myself without absorbing the little hints that she was dropping to me. By the time the movie was done, I wanted to rewind it (yes, I watched it on video tape) and watch it again. It is definitely one of those movies that draws you in and never lets go. Ira Levin (may he rest in peace) knew what he was doing when he wrote the book to this. I highly recommend it to anyone, although it doesn't really matter what order you do it in, whether that's being watching it first and then reading it or reading it first and then watching it. Roman Polanski was a real master at terror and suspense back in the day, especially with this work of art. If you want an authentic horror classic that will beg you to watch it over and over again, pick this. You won't regret it."
"triple8","10","136","187","29 April 2004"," the best supernatural movie ever made?
","I'm not sure about that but Rosemary's baby has got to be one of the best, if not the best, psychological supernatural thrillers ever made. The real test of a good movie(or one of them) is can it hold up to multiple viewings? In this case-oh yes.<br/><br/>I cannot even count how many times I have seen this. A good-really good-""scary movie"" must have more then the ability to merely scare, it must have the ability to haunt. Rosemary's baby is a movie where certain scenes become etched in memory. Movie as good as book which is almost a non existent thing.<br/><br/>This is not a slow moving picture at all or at least I don't see it as one. What this movie does, as does another Levin creation, Stepford wives, is lure you in. There maybe moments that are not scary but as it goes on and you keep watching you start to get more and more creeped out-the atmosphere is what does it-even if someone were tuning in and didn't know this story already-the creepy feeling that something's very wrong is still there strongly from the beginning, strengthening in tone as you get deeper into the picture until by the end and the final few scenes your blown away.This is definitely more subtley and atmospherically creepy then a ""boo"" in your face scare fest like ""scream"". It is the type of movie you very rarely see anymore.<br/><br/>If anyone, by chance has NOT seen it they are missing someone-I don't recall seeing this in the IMDb top 250-while I'm not sure I'd put it in my top 10, I still think this maybe should be there, in IMDb'S top 250, it's been an influence on so many other movies and so few movies have been able to follow the movie's lead in the same well done way."
"oyason","Null","61","80","19 February 2003"," In a word, outstanding.
","There are only a tiny handful of horrorfilms that really deserve the superlative outstanding, but Rosemary's Baby is definitely on my personal list and damn near the top of the column.<br/><br/>Elements of the supernatural are present; the murderous coven, the devil come to earth, the use of juju to destroy the enemy. But all of these things are at nothing compared to the real horror in Rosemary's life: that she is nothing more then a gestation vessel for her ambitious husband, the gory eccentrics in her building, and the most powerful demon in the Christian pantheon. No one takes her seriously in any other capacity. Even at the end, her last bit of resistance is broken down as Roman Castavet eases her into the role of the ""mother of destruction"".<br/><br/>I don't think it's any coincidence that Ira Levin wrote this novel or that it became such a huge hit in the sixties, when birth control pills became household words and the first open battles for legal abortion were being waged and won. The strength of this film is that it deals with social issues (reproductive rights) that were actively bouncing between the ears of the greater population of this country, and yet still doesn't become a tedious piece of social realism or agitprop. <br/><br/>The cast of the film is remarkable. Mia Farrow plays a woman protagonist who is far more self identified then the usual female victim in a Gothic, Guy Cassevetes plays a treacherous husband whose actions are beneath contempt, both performances are very precise. The film bounces adroitly from the high camp of Elija Cook's fastidious building superintendent to the great white fatherliness seen in Maurice Evan's character Hutch. The use of Ruth Gordon is inspired, having Sidney Blackmer play straight man to her zaniness even more so. The very fine comedienne Patsy Kelly shows up as a more obstreporous member of the coven, Ralph Bellamy is sedate and subdued as the suave warlock Sapperstein. And somehow or other, director Roman Polanski managed to tie all these energies together and create a solid, consistent package with a subdued pace that is both hysterical and chilling at the same time. It is one powerful satire.<br/><br/>Finally, the film contains one very strong nightmare sequence. Dreams are scary, Neil Gaiman reminds us,but there are few portrayed on film as strikingly as the one Rosemary has under a drug induced slumber on the night of her demonic group rape and the child's conception.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is a magnificent effort. And I believe it set a standard that every new horror film should be measured against, just as the film 2001 has become for many admirers of science fiction one of the benchmarks of that genre."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","8","11","12","31 October 2011"," An atmosphere like no other.
","This is how horror films need to be made. Aside from The House of the Devil (a beautiful throwback to this period of the genre) there aren't any films that can so perfectly create this kind of a chilling atmosphere that keeps your skin tingling from start to finish. From the haunting echo of Mia Farrow's voice eerily leading us in, Rosemary's Baby immediately absorbs you into it's world and never lets you out. That's the perfect word for this; absorbing. Roman Polanski is one of cinema's finest directors and what makes him stand as such is how perfectly he can create an atmosphere. Even in his few failures he crafts a unique and full atmosphere that is expertly made for the film he's creating. He's one of the few directors who always know what he's doing and always creates a complete vision that never wavers. That's on display in spades in Rosemary's Baby, a film that drives mystery, supernatural paranoia and the fears of any pregnant woman into the heart of the viewer. With the help of a revelatory performance in terror from Farrow, Polanski creates a truly perfect film."

","This is definitely one of the best horror films ever made.  The conspiracy that Rosemary goes throughout the film is truly creepy.  What makes it so scary is that she goes trusting her husband and 'friends' without any idea of what really is happening to her.  The rape scene is horrifying, very intense and at its best for the horror genre.  ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a great horror film, there are no posessions, no gore, but the film is intense in content.  It has power to make the audience nervous, tense and very scared. -********** A perfect 10."

","Roman Polanski's horror classic is literally pregnant with paranoia. Mia Farrow gets an iconic cropped 'do, John Cassavetes broods<br/><br/>
Halfway through Polanski's classic psycho-horror, Rosemary (Farrow) decides to chop off her bob. Not since Delilah took to Samson's barnet has a haircut signalled such a decline. <br/><br/>It's at that moment that Rosemary's slump into madness begins. She's pregnant, she's in love with husband Cassavetes, and living in a beautiful new apartment. But a burning pain in her womb tells her something's not right. Why are her elderly neighbours so concerned? Why has hubby's career suddenly blossomed? Surely her memory of being raped by Satan was just a dream? <br/><br/>Ira Levin's story erodes Rosemary's sanity drip by drip. A pierced ear, a foul smelling charm, a chocolate mousse with a chalky flavour, these are the unlikely fertilisers of her paranoia. In Polanski's hands their significance remains chillingly ambiguous as he explores the natural alienation of pregnancy. Truly terrifying."

","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Growing up my mother wouldn't watch it with me because ""it makes a mother's worse nightmare a real thing"" I never understood until I actually got around to watching it. Obviously, the plot of this movie would NEVER happen in real life, but that doesn't make the fear any less real. This movie is SO LONG. The beginning kind of drags, you can tell this lovely couple's new neighbors are kind of off, but I chalked it up to weird old people doing what they do best... making people uncomfortable. Throughout the movie you watch as the couple tries for a baby, conceives, goes through the pregnancy (which is no easy task for this poor soon-to-be mom) and finally the birth and disappearance of that child. There is really no way top really encompass the movie and the emotions I felt while watching it. I think everyone should watch this movie.

","""Rosemary's Baby"" centers on Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes), a young, happy couple who move into a New York City apartment building to start their life together. They are greeted by their elderly neighbors, Minnie and Roman Castevet (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer), an eccentric and friendly couple who are helpful but a bit intrusive. Rosemary and Guy plan on having a baby together, but the conception is strange and seems to have happened while Rosemary was dreaming. All the while, Minnie and Roman seem to form an unusual relationship with Guy, and begin to take over all the duties and events revolving around Rosemary's pregnancy - things that should be up to the mother. Meanwhile, Rosemary begins to lose weight, is constantly ill, and has odd pains in her stomach - things that aren't normal in a healthy pregnancy. After a series of strange events, Rosemary soon becomes convinced that Minnie and Roman are part of a Satantic cult, and that they have made some sort of exchange with Guy... a horrific exchange that involves Rosemary and her baby.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the greatest stories of betrayal to grace the silver screen, this adaptation from Levin's phenomenal novel is done neatly and the transfer to the screen is brilliant. The film, like the book, takes its time, but the slow-going nature gives plenty of room for formidable suspense and atmosphere.<br/><br/>One of the scariest things about ""Rosemary's Baby"" is its affect on the viewer. The paranoia, fear, claustrophobia, and foreboding that Rosemary feels channels directly to the audience, and you by proxy experience what she's experiencing. The first forty-five minutes or so seem fairly conventional, but after that the film goes into a straight downward spiral into madness, and by God do you feel it. There's a consistent sense of something not being quite right, mainly with the neighbors whose motives are questionable behind their friendly facade, and this feeling never dissipates. Within the element of the betrayal are the layers of subjects that make it a horror film— the Satanic society, the occult, strange rituals, the Antichrist, and the overall demonic subtext. It's all quite terrifying, and the contents of the plot are all sinister subjects. <br/><br/>The film looks amazing, as if it could have been shot just last week. Nice camera-work that is subtle and neat, but shaky and effective when needed. The settings are all truly spooky, and the Dakota is is photographed to its full Gothic effect.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow stars in the performance of her career as the young, naive Rosemary. All she wants is the ideal life with her husband and child, but she is swept into something more terrifying than she could ever imagine. Farrow plays the part precisely and gains plenty of sympathy from the audience. Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Woodhouse's nosy neighbor, Minnie. She's friendly and inquisitive, but we know from the start that she has ulterior motives, as well as her husband. John Cassavettes plays Guy excellently, and Sidney Blackmer is great as well as Minnie's odd husband. <br/><br/>As for the ending, it's a shocker, and probably the most memorable thing about the entire movie. It's something that will stick with you and that you can't easily shake, but is ambiguous enough to keep you asking questions.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a through-and-through classic. While it isn't 'scary' by conventional means, it manages to maintain a subtle, foreboding atmosphere, unnerving the audience to the point of paranoia. The performances are top-notch, and the subject matter is as shuddering as the Castevet's dark, evil intrusion into Rosemary's life. You'll spend an uncomfortable but spellbinding two hours on the edge of your seat. Isn't that what a good horror movie should do? 10/10."

","Young marrieds in New York City--he a Broadway hopeful, she a contented housewife--get the apartment of their dreams, but the wife is uncomfortable with her new neighbors right from the start. Mia Farrow is incredibly genuine as Rosemary Woodhouse; present in just about every scene, Farrow is handled exactly right by director Roman Polanski, who shows an unerring eye for detail. Polanski, who also adapted the screenplay, apparently loved the book by Ira Levin because there are details on the screen taken straight from Levin's pages (the book now reads like a novelization of the film). Some of my favorite scenes: Rosemary, looking at the belongings left behind by the last tenant of her future apartment, seeing a note that reads, ""I can no longer associate myself..."", asking the manager, ""Why would she cover up her vacuum cleaner and her towels?""; Rosemary dreaming about a mistake she made in Catholic school, confusing it with an argument going on next door and hearing her neighbor's braying voice, ""Now we have to start all over!""; John Cassavetes (in a brave performance as Guy) rushing home from the theater, nervous and serious, to pull a fast one on a dear friend; Rosemary staring at her neighbor's pierced ear, the music swelling up in the background; Rosemary in her doctor's office, telling the receptionist she's wearing a new perfume (""Detchema"") and finding out her smelly usual (a devilish fungus called ""Tannis Root"") is a favorite of... It's a stunning, stupendous effort with plush production, a fantastic supporting cast, creepy music from Christopher Komeda (with a title theme la-la-la'ed by Farrow herself) and an incredible amount of cunning wit and the blackest kind of humor."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>This is absolutely the most terrifying film ever made dealing with supernatural evil. Forget `The Exorcist,' that's kid stuff. Forget the hundreds of `jumping out of the dark' gore pictures. `The Shining'? effete. This has guts like the old horror radio shows used to because I can imagine something worse than anything you can make up and show with rubber and catsup.<br/><br/>And surprisingly, this film has aged well, even improved as the hippie era is now long gone.<br/><br/>Mia is preciously delicate, open. Her commitment to this film makes it real. One can feel her taking personal risks and this reflects on her character. Roman almost goes too far here, after `Repulsion,' walking the edge of suspense, slowly building, relentlessly restrained. He so eclipses Hitchcock in his camerawork; he so stamps this with a East European mystical surrealism that I wonder why this film is not more celebrated.<br/><br/>When `The Exorcist' came out five years later, the publicity machine made much of supernatural happenings on the set, in an attempt to make the film seem more real. But this film is damned creepy when you look at its history.<br/><br/>Many people were students of magick in those days, as part and parcel of spiritual exploration. Mia gets into this film rather by accident, has an affair with Polanski during it. Divorces her husband the singing thug and finishes the film. Goes to India with the Beatles, Donovan and Beach Boys to meditate, during which John and Paul write thirty songs based on Kabbalah. Inspired in part by Crowley.<br/><br/>This album inspires Manson to kill Polanski's wife, mistakenly thinking the house was occupied by someone close to the Beach Boys. Lennon takes up with Yoko directly on returning from India. Her interest in the occult leads her to the Dakota, where they keep their home until John is killed. During which period, Yoko has a parade of occultists and mystics, even the largest private US collection of Egyptian artifacts.<br/><br/>Polanski meanwhile makes the most powerful `Macbeth' ever filmed because of its emotional take on evil anarchy. Then he is exiled from the US. After a long dry spell and much preparation, makes `The Ninth Door.' which shows incredible understanding of the occult tradition in art, and his own role -- his current wife plays the supernatural agent of semiotic art. Pacing and direction refers to `Rosemary,' but is less confident, more frightened.<br/><br/>Jesus, scary enough for me."
"Bobbyh-2","Null","7","8","20 March 2003"," Nowadays, this film is an anomaly--a scary movie that uses atmosphere and suggestion, instead of gore.
","It's hard to discuss this film without using spoilers, so I'll get the non-spoiler part done first. Seeing this movie a few decades after my first viewing only confirms my high opinion of Polanski as a brilliant director. In an age when most directors seem to confuse gallons of stage blood and severed body parts with scariness, it's refreshing to be reminded that the most frightening movies need not resort to the grand guignol technique. This one does it with subtle suggestions and carefully crafted atmosphere, and the result is infinitely more effective than the confections in which hideously scarred maniacs take chain saws to shoals of nubile coeds, etc., etc., etc. The acting is quite good throughout: Farrow embodies vulnerable innocence, Cassavettes nails his role, and Ruth Gordon is sublime--was this the film that revitalized her career? It certainly deserved to be. But the star of this film, in terms of who makes the biggest contribution, is Polanski. The end result is a wonderfully evocative and chilling movie that works as well now as it did in the late 60s. (HERE COME THE SPOILERS---IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE FILM, STOP READING HERE) Leaving aside the question of why people, even in a fiction, would believably choose to be Satanists, the great virtue of this movie is the way in which it progresses by gradual steps from a kind of super-normality into a nightmare. Polanski's touches--the shadowy corners of the elaborate old apartment, a fragment of a faded note written by the former tenant, the illustrations in the book on witchcraft that Rosemary gets from the newly deceased ""Hutch""--the contrast between the banal, everyday world around the Woodhouses and the horror Rosemary is slowly but inevitably sucked into...it all works. The whole, to my mind, is greater than the sum of its parts. I would say it can be called a genre classic."

","Married couple Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes)move into a New York apartment which has a rather 'unsavoury' history. The Woodhouse's live next door to an elderly couple called Minnie and Roman Castevet (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) who are both warm and friendly towards the Woodhouse's. However, Rosemary soon starts to notice strange occurrences which she believes are connected, in one way or another, to the Castevets and when she falls pregnant she becomes convinced that the Castevets have plans of their own for her unborn child.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski has certainly got the 'feel' of this film absolutely spot-on; it is very atmospheric and as I've mentioned in my summary some of the 'chilling' scenes and imagery certainly make some parts of this film memorable, but aside from some of Polanski's impressive technical prowess Rosemary's baby is still not a film that I'm particularly fond of...<br/><br/>The first thing that needs address is the pacing and general narrative; it is a slow film, but rather than being a slow film that I gradually start to enjoy and become involved with it felt more like a film that just dragged on and on. What actually surprised me about this film was how little narrative content there was in this film (considering it runs for over 2 hours). The whole 'satanic' and 'witchcraft' plots are totally undercooked and Polanski offers us little insight into the strange neighbours until we reach the final scenes in the film. <br/><br/>The film certainly has a bit of a creepy feel to it and Polanski sets the creepy neighbours up wonderfully, but with little development this starts to become a bit gimmicky and with little development many of their scenes start to feel repetitive. Their darker side comes to the fore towards the end, but the impact that this has on the picture is tainted slightly in these final moments by an over-the-top and rather laughable performance from Sidney Blackmer which felt too theatrical to be entirely convincing. Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon gave the best performances with the former being very good.<br/><br/>Polanski showcases some impressive directorial touches with some wonderful atmosphere and chilling imagery which made some aspects of the film linger in my memory. Sadly, I just didn't find the story that involving and felt that both the story and the characters weren't developed enough to hold my interest. Some of the performances are good and it's a pretty impressive from a technical perspective, but, in my book, Rosemary's baby is merely a partial success."
"gon_zolo","5","77","131","20 October 2009"," Surprisingly meh.
","I rented Rosemary's Baby after having heard for many years what a perfect horror film it was. I thoroughly enjoy psychological thrillers and horror films like the Exorcist, Alien, Prince of Darkness, and the entire Hitchcock oeuvre, so I thought Rosemary's Baby was right up my alley.<br/><br/>Sadly I was mistaken. Most of the movie I ended up yelling at Mia Farrow's character to DO something (Rosemary really is a spineless, mindless idiot), when I wasn't groaning over the rather hammy performances of the other actors. Perhaps I'm too young to understand the ""helpless woman"" type of character, but instead of being in fear for Rosemary, I was simply annoyed by her.<br/><br/>The ""rape scene"" was the ""highlight"" of the movie, in that it had some genuinely creepy sequences (again, her husband's appearance and dialogue seemed out of place, but that was a minor part of the sequence). The rest of the movie, while trying to seem normal and everyday, just seemed obvious and annoyingly overacted. Even if you didn't figure out that the neighbors were up to something in the first few minutes, I would think you'd still be annoyed by them.<br/><br/>The supposed twist ending isn't really a twist at all, at least to me. It did provide some surprising laughs, as I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at a ""Hail Satan!"" Again, its supposed to be creepy that supposedly normal people are saying this, but it just comes off as campy.<br/><br/>All together, I really can't understand why this is still considered one of the great horror movies of all time. In 1968 Rosemary's helplessness might have led to psychological scares. In 2009 it just leads to frustration."

","What does it mean to give a movie 10/10? It must mean that no part of the film could possibly(!) be better: the characters must be three-dimensional and engage the viewer (whether it be sympathetic or antagonistic); the performances must then bring these characters to life; the script must carry the plot without stale verbiage or cliché; the story itself must be believable or, in the case of horror or science fiction, create the conditions wherein the story can be seen as believable; the editing must make it not a scene too long nor a scene too short; the music must beand you get the point, right? On each of these points, as well as any other you care to mention, 'Rosemary's Baby' easily qualifies.<br/><br/>Having established himself as an up-and-coming European director in the 1960s with the likes of his debut 'Knife in the Water' (1962), Roman Polanski was brought to America to direct this horror movie about a secret society of Devil worshippers composed of wealthy and distinguished citizens manipulating a young woman into giving birth to the child of Satan in late-60's New York. The film is the second part of Polanski's so-called ""apartment trilogy"" (the other parts being 'Repulsion (1965)' and 'The Tenant' (1976)) and as such begins with a shot of the Bramford apartment building (in reality the Dakota building which would later be the building John Lennon was shot in front of) which struggling actor Guy Woodhouse (Cassavetes) and his beautiful young wife Rosemary (Farrow) manage to bag a sizable apartment in. Despite being regaled with macabre stories of the history of the ""Black Bramford"" from their previous landlord/paternal figure Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins the couple move in to begin their new life and soon strike up a relationship with an elderly couple, Minnie (Gordan) and Roman Castevet (Blackmer), after a young drug addict in their care kills herself. Not long after (and with the ""help"" of a dizzying dream/nightmare sequence which is far more authentic than the famed Dali sequence in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound') Rosemary becomes pregnantbut her jubilation is short-lived and soon transforms into a disturbing paranoid nightmare.<br/><br/>For a horror film it is refreshingly free of gore or ridiculous ""jump-moments"", and instead slowly chills the viewer through an atmosphere which becomes increasingly unnerving and claustrophobic as Rosemary discovers various clues which suggest that the Castevets may be involved in the darkest of dealings, and may have lured Guy into their ranks. However, the film perfectly walks the line between suggesting an actual conspiracy (supernatural or otherwise) and a hysterical paranoid fantasy on Rosemary's part which is surely a testament to the fine performances of every one of the cast. A particular joy of the film are the countless ""Oh yeah"" moments you get from corroborating, upon repeat viewings, observations made by Rosemary like the mismatched paintings on the walls of the Castevets' apartment when they first visit, or that Guy is still wearing his make-up when he returns home unexpectedly early to disrupt Hutch's visit, all of which contribute to Rosemary suspecting that something is afoot. These subtle psychological ploys unsettle the viewer as they suggest things which we are prone to miss despite being in plain sight and effectively conjures an atmosphere rooted in the familiar but where disturbing figures may be watching from the periphery.<br/><br/>A year later, Polanki's wife Sharon Tate would star in the role which would earn her pop-culture immortality: a butchered victim of Charles Manson's family. As such, with its explicit occult themes (although Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey's involvement as a consultant and the figure of the Devil in the dream sequence has been shown to be false) and its exultant subversion of Nietzsche's ""God is Dead!"" the film could be seen as an eerie prophecy of the darker vein inherent in the flower-power ideology which ended so abruptly with the Tate-LaBianca slayingsand the post-script of which would be with Lennon's murder outside the BramfoDakota building. Polanski himself would go on to secure his Hollywood A-List status with 'Chinatown' (1974) and 'The Pianist' (2002), but how can one's career improve upon a movie genuinely worthy of 10/10?"

","(There are Spoilers) One of the best horror movies ever made with almost no blood or splatters scenes at all with the exception of Terry, Victoria Vetri, jumping, off camera, to her death form the seventh floor of the Bramford Building. ""Rosemary' Baby"" has to do with the most darkest fears one can conjure up in a movie book as well as in one's own mind; The return of Satan-the Devil-on earth and everything that goes along with him.<br/><br/>It's early October 1965 and the Pope, Pope Paul VI, has made a historical visit to the US and is in the process of giving a sermon, to some 60,000 people, at New York's Yankee Stadium. It's also the time designated by a coven of Devil worshiping witches for the Devil's offspring, to be named Adrian, to be conceived by the unsuspecting and Catholic observant Rosemary Woodhouse, Mia Farrow.<br/><br/>Since Rosemary and her actor husband Guy, John Cassavetes, moved into the creepy Bramford Building they've become very friendly with the elderly couple who lives next door to their apartment Roman and Minnie Castevet, Sidney Blackman & Ruth Roman. Even though Rosemary is not that taken in by the Castevets eccentric and somewhat wired behaviors her husband Guy is. Guy a struggling actor was desperately trying to get a part in a play that the far more talented Donald Baumgart, Tony Curtis, got. After Guy's involvement with the Castevets Baumgart suddenly lost his sight opening the door for another actor to replace him: Guy Woodhouse!<br/><br/>The movie starts to grow and accelerate, together with Rosemary's pregnancy, in both tension as well as curiosity as she becomes very frail and sickly as the day of the ""blessed event"", June 28, 1966, is soon to arrive. Feeling that something just isn't right Rosmary has been haunted since her night of conception, October 5/6 1965, it that she feels that it's wasn't Guy who fathered her now soon to be born child but the Devil or Satan,played by Clay Tanner, himself!<br/><br/>Despite the movie's many subplots, all centered around Rosemary's pregnancy and birth to her child, the film is never confusing in that they, the subplots, all come together in the film's final and shocking ten or so minutes! The Woodhouse's at first had no idea to what evil existed right at their front doorsteps! Soon they would become in their associations with the Castevets the very central, and rotten, core of it!<br/><br/>It was family friend Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins, Maurice Evens, who knew not only the history of the eerie Bramford Building but that of one of its infamous tenants Steven Marcato. It was also that knowledge that lead to Hutch falling into a deep coma that he never came out of!<br/><br/>****SPOILER ALERT**** It was Marcato who was killed by an angry New York mob some 80 years ago for secretly practicing witchcraft! It was also Marcato who had a son who had since changed, or rearranged, his name and became a man of the world as well as, in his many travels, secretly gotten himself involved with the occult like his father did! That person is non other then the Woodhouse's kindly and harmless looking next door neighbor Roman Castevet himself!<br/><br/>Making a pact with the Devil has its price and the price that Guy Woodhouse paid for bringing him, in Guy allowing Satan to rape his wife Rosemary, out of the depths of Hell and into the unsuspecting world above was more that it was worth. Guy's career in both TV and the movies, as well as the theater, took off like a shot but in reality he ended up damned for all eternity. As for poor Rosemany in the end after seeing what her new born son really looked like, and what he represented, it was both her goodness, in Rosemary's Christian beliefs, and maternal instincts that eventually overrode her horror and revulsion in what she was forced, by her husband Guy and the Castevets, to unknowingly participate in. As the movie ends Rosemary is heard humming the lullaby theme of the movie as she's gently and tenderly rocking the ""cute"" little Devil, her son Adrian, to sleep!"

","What struck me most about this film is something that I don't think anyone has mentioned yet which is the use of colour. For a large section of the film, the overwhelmingly predominant colour is yellow, traditionally the colour of Satan. Then, as the birth draws near and after the birth, blue is brought in, an allusion to the Virgin Mary. There are many scenes symbolically comparing her to Mary, notably one while she is giving birth with her head on a pillow with yellow stripes on it so it appears she has a halo. There are so many things like that to notice, which is one of the reasons I love it so much."

Finally, after god knows how long, I decide to watch this movie. My expectations were high, I thought I would be scared to death and whatnot. But that was not the case. The movie doesn't start until a little less than an hour into the movie. That's when we finally get to see what's so ""scary"" - she's being raped by the devil. Ooooooohh. The next 1 1/4 hour, nothing happened either. All we saw were people talking, Rosemary being in pain, then her running around screaming ""Witches are after my baby!"" She talked to her husband, to her doctor, another doctor - but ""surprisingly enough"" they were all in this little satanic cult. So shocking, aye? The movie ends as shitty as it begins. With nothing happening, at all.

There are only 1-2 significant plot developments, and they're spaced so far apart that by the 2nd one, you don't even care. You just want it to be over.<br/><br/>The absolute worst part of the film is that it's told from the perspective of a completely helpless person. Yeah, she gets put in a messed up situation. But she has the IQ of a 12 year old to not be able to get out of it. Literally every time she does something right, she turns around and does 5 things wrong. It's insufferable to try to cheer for this dope.<br/><br/>And if that isn't bad enough, after sitting through this incredibly frustrating film, it gives you an ending that provides no payoff whatsoever. All it does it reinforce the moronic nature of the main character, and everything wrong with the movie to begin with.<br/><br/>For this to be considered a classic, I can only assume there are a bunch of old timers reminiscing about the good times and living in denial about films like this. I was excited to watch this movie with all the hype behind it, and I'm not opposed to older movies. But this was just awful.

","Indeed ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a classic but let's get the bad points out of the way first. Some scenes are awkward, Mia Farrow and her new found friend in the washing room really doesn't belong in a movie hailed as a classic. Terrible dialogue and acting from both. Farrow seems to change accents throughout the movie, even in her same lines which is a little off putting. However she is terrific in this role as the quiet naive woman who senses over the films two hours that something is very wrong. The movie has been directed much like Nicolas Roeg's classic, Don't Look Now, that classic 70's look of chopping and changing scenes during dialogue. Rosemary's Baby is also very sexually aware of itself, and one could say with all validity was the bridge between censorship issues and what would follow in the glorious 70's.<br/><br/>The movie was shot in the Dakota Buildings, and looks dreadfully eerie, director Roman Polanski makes New York like that too, which all fits with the mood of the film. John Cassavetes has some great lines and is particularly good, though isn't needed once he plays his cards too early. But two actors out-stage Farrow and Cassavetes and that is their old noisy could be witch neighbors played delightfully well by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. The performances in the movie are phenomenal, particularly that of Ruth Gordon, who plays the nosy meddling neighbor (she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance). Mia Farrow is also very convincing as Rosemary, the trapped individual whose intentions are always good.<br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" is still as watchable today (and, of course, deeply horrific and disturbing) as it was all those years ago. It doesn't need gallons of fake blood or computer-generated effects to be scary. Everything here feels a little too real and is a credit to how films can be made. Don't expect a roller-coaster ride of scares and guts – it's much too 'foreboding' to succumb to anything so cheap and easy. If you're in the mood for something horrible, dark with an every-increasing sense of dread then give this one a watch before it gets remade with too many special effects and no soul.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

","Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates).<br/><br/>R's Baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme. There's no real ideas in it... nothing to consider except being the mother of the devil.<br/><br/>The Dakota is barely exploited for it eerie potential."

And the ending was the most disappointing of all. The only person worth watching is Ruth Gordon. She is a terrific actress. Rosemary's husband Guy Woodhouse is goofy and Rosemary herself is overly dramatic. It would have been interesting to have Rosemary's husband act more like a con man telling how beautiful and wonderful she is. The sex scene with the devil is silly. A remake of this film could be much creepier and the ending in my opinion should be modified slightly. I think Rosemary should have tried to kill the baby once she found out it was the devil's. This would have been the one excitement in the whole film, especially if the baby killed her instead.

She goes to India with the Beatles, Donovan and Beach Boys to meditate, during which John and Paul write thirty songs based on Kabbalah. Inspired in part by Alistar Crowley.<br/><br/>That album ends up being the inspiration to Manson to kill Polanski's wife, mistakenly thinking the house was occupied by someone close to the Beach Boys. Lennon takes up with Yoko directly on returning from India. Her interest in the occult leads her to the Dakota, where they keep their home until John is killed.<br/><br/>Reading what I just typed, doesn't it make it seem the movie got John killed? It ended up being in the peripheral setting of the events of the Manson murders."

","People seem to approach this as being a horror movie. Well, I guess it's not. And certainly not in days where the genre has been fully occupied by more or less brain dead slasher flicks.<br/><br/>So to be perfectly clear, this movie is more or less typical Polanski style apartment suspense stuff, with the usual, well balanced mixture of paranoia and sarcasm. And as such it's outstandingly playful, entertaining and well crafted.<br/><br/>Most notable of course are the character portrayals, and those many special moments one immediately realizes were created not to drive the story, further the potential success of the movie or the fame of anybody involved, but to plainly create atmosphere and entertain us.<br/><br/>Just take the suicide sequence, the outfits in which Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer come strolling down the street and the following dialog about cleaning windows at night, all in face of a dead body. If I ever saw sarcasm working on screen, I'd say it was here.<br/><br/>And the shot of Gordon holding her spectacles up to further inspect that young women who might know more about the relations of the deceased than herself - this potentially being a threat of course. Clearly, this stuff borders on being cartoonish, but Polanski - and Gordon - truly walk the line here.<br/><br/>Also a favorite of mine, their first dinner and Farrow's looking back into the dining room while helping out in the kitchen - all just quiescence, only the tobacco smoke hinting at people sitting around the corner and maybe talking about what? Ample space for our fantasy to fill in, deliberately given to us.<br/><br/>Gordon's performance here as house invading, chit chatting ever inquisitive elderly lady is a blast anyway. To me, one of the most memorable captured on screen, ever. Very much notable also Cassavetes, extending the evasiveness of his character to almost avoiding the camera. Rarely seen amongst actors I'd say, and giving a nice opaqueness to his performance.<br/><br/>I could go on of course, likely for hours and without even mentioning classics like the phone booth sequence. To me, this, Chinatown and Le Locataire comprise Polanski's classic period, and are ample evidence of what a really exceptional Hollywood studio director he was and could further have been - if he hadn't blown it himself. Very regrettable, really.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, to the true film fan."
"bob the moo","Null","11","19","21 June 2004"," Creepy and effective thriller based on atmosphere and ambiguities (spoilers)
","Rosemary and Guy are newlyweds who move into a new apartment in an old building. They meet and befriend the elderly couple next door, the Castevet's, who are very friendly and make them both feel welcome. After Guy's acting career suddenly turns around and he lands quite a big role (due to the original actor going blind suddenly) the couple decide to try for a baby. They plan the night that they will try on both Rosemary gets drunk and passes out, dreaming of some weird rape-like attack. She awakes the next morning to find that Guy had just been drunk and had had sex with her anyway  but she forgives him when she finds she is pregnant. However with both Guy and the Castevet's acting strangely it appears that something strange is going on, or is it just a frustrated Rosemary's over imagination?<br/><br/>Of course, many of us know the answer to this question; even those who have not seen the film will know that things are not just in Rosemary's head, however what makes the film so creepy and enjoyable is the fact that Polanski doesn't seem to want to make his mind up either and plays it right down the middle. As such the simple plot sees lots of ambiguity in the story for much of the story, although we are pretty sure something is going on the director never comes right out and says it, instead he continually suggests it while also pointing to Rosemary's mental instability. It is the confusion in Rosemary that makes this so creepy and engaging  she herself goes between disregarding her fears and embracing them and it is very effect in building the tension even if we know what is the truth (or else there wouldn't be a film!). However, even though we know what is coming, the end is still very creepy and I was surprised just how effective it was even on a second viewing.<br/><br/>The story builds a nice conspiracy well and sustains a real creepy atmosphere all the way through to good effect. The performances are also key in pulling off Polanksi's trick. Farrow is suitable unbalanced and we feel her fear and suspicion growing during the film. Her performance is really good and the fact that she manages to balance her own doubt for most of the film is very effective. Cassavetes is also excellent, all at once he is friendly, cheerful, menacing and mysterious; he also plays a big part in creating the sense of doubt that drives the film's tension. Ruth Gordon is a nightmare neighbour and overplays very well even if her character is a bit of a cliché  I certainly would not want her for my neighbour, but she is never so creepy that we know for sure, only overbearing in a normal yet weird manner. Likewise Blackmer is effective as the potential head of the coven and is never too obvious to blow the tension. The support cast are all good and echo the performances of Blackmer and Gordon.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great horror thriller. Another review on this site has rightly pointed out that too many modern films in this loose genre will have a vague tension over poor dialogue delivered by a 'teen-friendly' cast and then tonnes of expensive effects. Happily Polanski is smarter than that here and he uses doubt, tension and atmosphere blended with good dialogue and some fine characters to create a film that is never really scary so much as it is just creepy. Even though I know it inside out it is still effective and it doesn't bode well for modern films that rely on effects instead of these qualities."
"Jonny_Numb","8","5","7","22 April 2006"," A masterpiece of mood
","Like ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a horror film that is so justifiably praised that it's a pretty futile effort to attempt to find something that hasn't been said about it before, and better. Until recently, it had been many years since I'd seen the film, and upon revisiting it (with a newfound appreciation for director Roman Polanski), was thoroughly impressed.<br/><br/>The story is simple and ingenious, and hooks us from the start: Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her actor husband, Guy (John Cassavetes) move into an upscale New York apartment complex attract the attention of their kind yet invasive neighbors; shortly after, Rosemary becomes pregnant and grows increasingly concerned that the residents are plotting against her. Polanski would revisit this type of paranoia (albeit through male eyes) in ""The Tenant""; ""Rosemary's Baby"" takes a similarly subjective approach to the story, telling it largely through the perspective of the title character--and Mia Farrow is incredibly good at conveying pain, sorrow, fear, and submission.<br/><br/>In addition to structuring suspense well, Polanski also gives the film a sense of patriarchal commentary: the husband is cunning, cocky, self-centered, and manipulative; ditto the loathsome Dr. Saperstien (Ralph Bellamy) who insists that Rosemary stop reading books that might cause worry. Throughout the film, Rosemary is presented as a passive, soft-spoken wallflower, easily put in her place by the male figures in her life; even when she uncovers the conspiracy around her, everyone is so firmly pitted against her that her efforts become meaningless in the face of the inevitable. Polanski makes us pity Rosemary and loathe the occult conspirators, but gives us a conclusion that drips of irony from all angles--in a sense, a great injustice is perpetrated, then accepted.<br/><br/>With ""Rosemary's Baby,"" Polanski delivers a masterpiece of mood and subtle scares without a reliance on blood and guts. Strong performances and a fine story contribute to making this a gem of the genre."
"Polaris_DiB","10","8","13","15 October 2005"," A devil of a good time
","Honestly, one cannot ask more from a horror movie. Sans any special effects, it's all up to the story, acting, and directing to pull it all off, and they all work perfectly together to appropriate the correct mood.<br/><br/>Rosemary Woodhouse and her husband, an aspiring actor, move into a new apartment to start their future off... the apartment is near to where the husband must go to get work, and it's big enough that they may have room for children. Their initial excitement eventually leads to her becoming impregnated, though under suspicious circumstance. Eventually the pregnancy becomes less than welcome as physical pain and continually untrustworthiness of surrounding people start hemming Rosemary in...just as she begins to feel they are plotting against her baby.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski said of the book, ""At first I thought it was a soap opera, and then I found myself reading it at four in the morning with my eyes burning."" So the directing goes. Mia Farrow's acting is of young innocence that seems rather childish in some parts, but profoundly adult in others: she is a young woman with hopes and dreams and worst of all, fears. Rosemary's concern is never for herself, even as she discovers the plot against her; it's for her child.<br/><br/>Better, the audience is never really sure she's not insane. As the plot thickens away from cheery city life towards claustrophobic fear of entrapment, even as we sympathize with Rosemary her angst, her outward worry is not sympathetic to a world where everyone acts as if all is normal. For all we know, nothing could be wrong at all.<br/><br/>Then we find ourselves at the end, the coup de grace of horror movie design, where she makes a decision that is sure to shock even the most blase of viewers.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is amazing. At one point she's looking at a clock and it seems to warp in space and grow further away from her, fitting her insecurity expressionistically perfectly. Simple things like doorways are shown as if there's no mystery behind them at all, yet as they are opened they become foreboding.<br/><br/>For horror fans, there is little better.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"tommmk","10","6","9","5 January 2013"," One of the Best Movies Ever
","It should come as no surprise that ""Rosemary's Baby"" ranks in the top 250 on IMDb; I, however, would rank it even higher than the general public does. It's the kind of film you can watch occasionally over the years and enjoy each and every time, i.e., a classic. Technically the film is brilliant, with superb cinematography, editing, music, acting, art design, and masterful direction. Polanski captures the timeless essence of New York, at least as I remember it, even though the setting is unmistakably the 1960s, and the milieu is literally diabolical. Depending on how you look at it, you can enjoy the film as a supernatural thriller or as a psychological thriller and study in paranoia. I especially love the dream sequences, which have a surreal beauty and nightmarish logic of their own."

","Having watched this fantastic movie from teens up until last Saturday I cannot rate it enough. This sinister story with a satanic underbelly keeps me gripped from start to finish and it seems every time i watch it I notice something new. I won't bother going into the story of what it is about as there have been enough synopsis before me but i just wanted to highlight the things that i love about the story:- 1) When Rosemary and Guy are first shown around the apartment and the caretaker notices that the cabinet is hiding a cupboard (we the viewer immediately want to know what's in there and why it's covered up) 2) When Terry is found on the pavement, Rosemary intervenes when the Castavette's say she has no family, she say's, ""Doesn't she have a brother in the navy"" and immediately Minny puts on her glasses to see who else knows about Terry in case they are suspected of something.<br/><br/>3) When Rosemary and guy have dinner with Castavettes and she is helping Minnie wash up, the first sinister inkling is when Rosemary looks from the kitchen into the living rm and just see's smoke coming from Guy and Roman (you just want to know what's being said).<br/><br/>I could go on and on but it's the subtle things that make this movie stand out and it is definitely one of my top 10 movies of all time."
"LoneWolfAndCub","10","6","9","22 June 2007"," A creepy, slow but landmark horror film
","Before 'The Exorcist' scared the wits out of people about devil possession Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby came along in 1968 to scare the audiences then. Not your typical horror flick; this is slow and brooding and eventually leads to a shocking and terrifying finale that only few could have pulled off as flawlessly as Polanski did. This isn't cheap, schlocky horror, this is pure horror (at its best).<br/><br/>Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavettes) move into a new apartment. Across their room live two elderly people, Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon, in an Oscar winning performance). They are very friendly people and Guy takes an immediate liking to them but Rosemary isn't so sure about them. She hears weird noises coming from their room at night, they seem to take down their pictures whenever they go over to their apartment and other things like that. When Rosemary becomes pregnant they start to become more intrusive. They convince her to switch doctor and Minnie starts giving her ""herbal"" drinks everyday. It is a rather unpleasant pregnancy, though, Rosemary is having constant pains and soon she starts suspected everyone of foul play.<br/><br/>The mood of this film is set perfectly from the very start when we hear the creepiest piece of music (a lullaby) played over the opening credits (sung by Mia Farrow). Polanski is a genius at setting mood, throughout the whole movie their is a sense of unease that gradually builds until your on the very edge of your seat waiting for the final revelation. Polanski doesn't rely on gore or special effects, in fact, their is (save for one brief moment of a corpse) no gore at all in the film. Very much unlike modern horror films might I add!<br/><br/>The best part of this movie, though, is the outstanding acting. Horror movies are unfortunately part of a stereotype which suggests no good acting can come out of a horror movie. How wrong those people are. Every single performance is perfect. Mia Farrow plays the naive but suspecting wife hauntingly realistic. She truly looks like she is suffering from her pregnancy. John Cassavettes is great as the self-centred Guy, an actor who never really pays attention to his wife. Ruth Gordon, though, is the stand-out performance as Minnie. Although she is a friendly, bubbly, helpful woman there is always a sinister feeling she radiates and the same can be said for Sidney Blackmer as well. Ruth Gordon rightfully deserved that Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a horror film with real scares, top-notch performances, a creepy soundtrack and a hell of a twisted ending look no further than Rosemary's Baby.<br/><br/>5/5"
"Quinoa1984","10","12","22","25 July 2003"," Two of the shots in this film were equally disturbing and uproarious- the film stands as one of Polanski's crowning thrillers
","Ira Levin's Rosemary's Baby was adapted by Polish director Roman Polanski, who in his American directing debut, created a horror film that contained no gore, practically no blood, no characters with knives and other weapons. Just the feeling of constant dredd and confusion over the fate of a woman's child.  Mia Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse, wife of a struggling actor, who finds a new apartment in New York called the Dakota.  Here, they meet some neighbors (one of which is the impecable, Oscar winning Ruth Gordon) who befriend them, invite themselves over whenever, and even bring food as gifts.  Rosemary and her husband, played by director John Cassavettes, think about having a baby, but aren't sure if the time is right.  Then one night, after having a drink that the ""friendly"" neighbor brings over, they make love to concieve, though that may or may not be how Rosemary sees it ""this is not a dream, this is really happening!""  From then on, the film develops as Rosemary gets pregnant, is recommended a doctor (Ralph Bellamy) who may or may not be giving her the right medical advise, and as she enters her thirs trimester, she starts to realize something is fishy about her neighbors, and her un-born child.<br/><br/>Like Polanski's 1965 film Repulsion, the viewer gets a feeling of something that one could feel in such horror films as Texas Chainsaw Massacre or, more appropriately, the Blair Witch Project- we feel scared or in a state os suspense not because of what we see, but of what we don't see and can't figure out.  Those who want to compare this to The first Exorcist need to know that this is the European perspective of a Satan story, and that this builds more brilliantly on claustrophobia while the other builds on the un-expected with style.  Overall, Rosemary's Baby is a remarkable achievement in the genre, and in the very last moment in the end, the sense of acceptance Rosemary achieves is possibly the most scariest thing about it.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the one line summary, there are two shots that to me represent the kind of startling and, bizarrely, even funny double edged sword Polanski can pull in films like this (see also John Huston in Chinatown):  the one shot of the ""devil"" on top of Rosemary will make some drop their mouths open in shock, as did I, but I was sort of laughing at it too, in the manner of how she's so calm in the scene.  Another is in the climax, when the witches are gazing proudly at their master's new bouncing baby boy, and out of nowhere there's a little Chinese guy with a camera taking pictures.  I'm not sure if this is a detail Polanski took from the book, or if he threw it in himself, but it's rather amazing that this person appears in a group of Satan galvanizers.  Grade: A+"
"aidanratesmovies","9","2","2","22 April 2020"," Timeless
","Interesting, well acted, and superbly well crafted- Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a thriller that is not only scary- but one that will always stand the test of time. The film is very well acted, most notably by Mia Farrow who plays Rosemary herself. The film is a bit slow at times, but at every interesting twist and turn, your attention is so forced upon the screen- its truly quite enjoyable. The set pieces and costumes are of the time, and deeply nostalgic in pleasure. The soundtrack is haunting and the cinematography and atmosphere is so as well. The film does feel like it could be about 10 minutes shorter, but even with its slow way of telling the tale, the film makes the best of what its got and makes for a truly suspenseful time.

","Rosemary's baby is a piece of cinema.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the story of a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult wants to take her baby for use in their rituals. Rosemary's Baby deals with themes related to paranoia, women's liberation, Christianity (Catholicism), and the occult.<br/><br/>For all that can be said about director Roman Polanski's character, his fantastic film making ability is undeniable.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the film is first class. Mia Farrow who plays Rosemary Woodhouse is brilliant. She was able to showcase her demise so genuinely and as an audience we get a real feel for the fear she is experiencing.<br/><br/>Ruth Gordon must also receive credit in her performance as Minnie Castevet. Minnie is a character that many audiences have probably came across in their life time but that does not make us feel any easier about her strangeness.<br/><br/>The story throughout film is quite gripping. You are constantly questioning the fate of Rosemary. Is she insane or is there a plot to capture her baby, is her husband vying against her or disillusioned to the whole situation.<br/><br/>Visually the film is unbelievable. Dare I say, Rosemary's baby is visually perfect. The interior of the apartment and the Gothic New York are a real treat on the eye.<br/><br/>The film may escape the understanding of casual audiences. The film simply requires patience for full enjoyment. Its slow build is one that is greatly underappreciated, especially in the horror genre.<br/><br/>Rosemary's baby is simply a huge milestone in the history of cinema. One would cause themselves an injustice to miss this horror masterpiece."
"daryopeek","10","2","2","10 April 2020"," Even after third time watching it ... Still a classic!
","It is my third time watching the horror experienced by Rosemary who undergone a haunting route during her pregnancy. And each time, Mia Farrow's acting always shakes my nerves. Among supernatural-occult-satanism horror genre, despite of our encounter with many recent ones, this film's position as one of my favorite horror film of all time.<br/><br/>Recounting my experience, I think what makes this film separates itself from the rest is the drastic appearances and acts of the titular character throughout the story. Starts from an optimistic, full of life Rosemary, turns to a paranoid-hysteric woman that brings the most of the horror given by the concept. Fully using suspense elements, Rosemary's Baby doesn't have time to collect audiences' attention by scary images. It used Mia Farrow's expression to channel the fear of being fear of your own spouse, being scared of your neighborhood, and being lonely because you miss your friends. Even though the film not said it, the character, suffered and vulnerable, manages to keep the tension and mystery float to make us wonder and empathize on her fate.<br/><br/>What also makes the film different than the others is the nuance of the scenes, always give a sense of homey, safe, environment, while the psychological side of the character(s) is worsening. The opposite sides make the unnerving, paranoid, and unsafe feelings are able to resonated to us. Polanski had Repulsion and The Tenant which share Rosemary's similar theme, but this film manages to top them both with stronger and deeper lead to convince us to join the macabre tour.<br/><br/>Closing this review, Rosemary's Baby is deserved to be picked as one of the best horror film of all time, a classic that still able to shake our nerves even after 50 years passed. Not because it has scary images or gore, but because the film can capture the development of Rosemary's character well, through the setting and the plot, makes us understand what's the best of a horror film: The uneasy feelings that keep linger even after the credits roll."

","Underneath the demonic happenings, Rosemary's Baby possesses much more down-to-earth and scarier themes. Such as the fear of pregnancy, marital rape and man controlling woman's bodies. A suspenseful, chilling and haunting motion picture. Mia Farrow is sensational as Rosemary and the physical transformation she goes through is disturbing. Ruth Gordon is no less impressive as the nosy neighbor. Rosemary's Baby does a great job of building up the suspense. As the film moves along and gets peculiar by the minute, one cannot tell what's real or imagined. One of the all time great psychological horror films."

But this movie just seems to be made of some kind of golden stuff. Every moment oozes atmosphere, even when they're just chatting.<br/><br/>Maybe its the lurid color of the semi-bourgeois inner city and reserved but decisive approach to camera work. It can seem a bit campy and grand guignel (I think I'm using that right) but that only helps its attempt to through you into a strange new world almost like our own.<br/><br/>Dread builds and is intensified with a constant feeling of understatement and denial. Apparently the book is a lot more subtle but I felt that the approach in revealing the narrative was impeccable as the hidden darkness among the seemingly normal emerges.<br/><br/>Vivid.<br/><br/>Just an update: I read a review in Halliwell's that this movie is ""Good in a Heavy Handed way, the book being a lot more subtle"".

Her friend Hutch realises something is amiss right off the bat and points it out to her. That friend goes into acoma the next day and dies later on.

What I expected to be (at least) a decent way to kill an hour or two turned out to be a well-acted, disturbing, and psychological horror film.  I won't go into detail about the plot (though many people have probably heard about it without seeing it, like I had), but I will say that Rosemary's Baby is a good example of the horror film that doesn't rely on blood and gore to make an impression.  I'm not very experienced in the genre of horror cinema, but I would recommend this to anyone who has even a passing interest in horror.<br/><br/>Silent Hill fans will enjoy looking for points of similarity between the film and certain aspects of the game series (that's as specific as I'll be on that point).<br/><br/>In summary: disturbing in a GOOD way- intentionally so- and intelligently crafted.

Really paid attention to the performances this time and came away with even greater admiration for the one and only Ruth Gordan and her on screen husband Sidney Blackmer.  Even Mia Farrow's performance was better than I remembered.  Cassavetes was a bit stiff, but Maurice Evans was terrific. Fun to see a young Charles Grodin.  Yeah, there is a ton of interesting background info with the connections between Polanski/Farrow, Farrow/Sinatra, Polanski/Sharon Tate (who appears briefly in this one) and the subsequent horrific tale of the Charles Manson clan.  In spite of that, this is a wonderful film."
"magic_marker","8","2","2","8 June 2002"," A quiet, erudite chiller, but not conventionally frightening
","If there are omens in this world, they were not heeded by the makers of Rosemary's Baby. The director would soon see his own pregnant wife disemboweled by the Manson family, the actor hired to play Satan would be revealed as a serial rapist, the leading lady would see her husband engage in an affair with someone who was effectively their daughter, and the building around which the film was shot would 12 years later bear witness to the tragic death of John Lennon. <br/><br/>This was without a doubt a cursed film, and its sado-sexual undercurrents are ultimately made more powerful by knowledge of the evils, perversions, and obsessions woven into the myth of its making.<br/><br/>However, do not expect to be overtly frightened by this film. Unlike more recent ""traditional"" horror films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others,"" this film will not make you jump. It is instead a slightly comic, often disturbing psychological portrait of one innocent woman's breakdown as she comes into contact with the carnal and callous power of Satanism. Mia Farrow plays this breakdown perfectly. Her performance (easily the best she has ever given) is potently tremulous, and effectively walks the fine line between hysteria and conviction. The Satanists, into whose complete power she is delivered by her husband, possess a wonderfully concealed menace, particulaly the obstetrician, a smiling, cold-eyed fascist.<br/><br/>The once infamous scenes, such as Rosemary eating raw liver, lack the shock value they once had, and are filmed in such a documentary style that whatever horror they could have conveyed is lost on modern audiences. Whatever power the film has is entirely invested in Rosemary's descent into madness, and that is still as powerful as ever"

Cassavetes is great as the sly and ambitious husband, Ruth Gordon is perfection as the nosy neighbor who babbles about everything, and Elisha Cook, Jr. has a nice bit near the beginning.  The music is creepy.

","I just watched this movie, and I must say it is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. The interactions between the stars were extremely awkward, the ""suspense"" wasn't exciting at all and the pace of the movie was far too slow. The plot is extremely obvious from the start and there was nothing to make the viewer think deeply. There were too many scenes that I would deem unnecessary, and without them, the movie might have been a little better. Many scenes seemed incredibly random and were not explained further anywhere else. The ending was lame and the loose ends could have been tied up much, much better. There was nothing remotely creepy or intense about it. This movie should not be classified as a ""thriller""; ""a bore"" would be more appropriate. I'm not sure if this movie could ever possibly scare anyone, so I'd recommend skipping this one."

","I was searching for some great horror movies, and this name recurred in several lists, so I went ahead and saw this movie and was bitterly disappointed to say the least. <br/><br/>The plot is engaging and intriguing on the onset, and the movie has an overall vintage kind of feel which raises your expectations from the film. But as the movie proceeds you will think like you are up for some unforeseen magic on the celluloid, like someone is lifting you up in the air to exalt you but in the end that someone will let you go, and you will fall flat on the ground utterly dissatisfied and dejected.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting in the movie, Mia Farrow has done a fine job. John Cassavetes on the other hand is very unconvincing. The chemistry between them seems forced rather than organic. Other actors have done their bit satisfactorily.<br/><br/>The story is suitable to be told in novel format only. Although the movie kind of grows on you, like someone taking you to the edge of the mountain just so you could appreciate the view, but then instead that someone pushes you off the cliff, the ending of the film does that ""pushing off the cliff"" thing here. The ending just blows a blatant hole in the entire plot and you end up thinking ""Did I just watch the entire movie for this..?""<br/><br/>Being so highly rated in so many lists on IMDb and elsewhere I expected a lot more from the movie, but it fell miles short of my expectations."
"sevilla_vatax","10","5","8","31 July 2013"," Rosemary's baby
","While Rosemary's Baby is often dubbed a horror film, the contemporary viewer may find that generic attribution confusing. Due to its slow pace and reliance on less-traditional formal tools to create suspense, Rosemary's Baby, like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980), is best described as a psychological thriller or suspense story. Polanski's film, adapted from a novel by Ira Levin, isn't furnished with bloody murders and shocking off-screen entrances. Rather, what makes Rosemary's Baby terrifying is the sense of inevitability. Yes, this inevitability not only manifests itself in the plot, as Rosemary is incapable of stopping the plans set in motion by her neighbors, but from the audience as well. Polanski cues us in to the cult's true intent quite early with the aid of surrealistic dream sequence, so we're aware of Rosemary's potential fate far sooner than she is. Hitchcock once described the difference between surprise and suspense as involving the knowledge of the audience, concluding that in order to fully capitalize upon suspense, ""the public must be informed."""

","Today I watched ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) by Roman Polański. I didn't expect much from it, but, by Jove, I was surprised. It's a masterpiece. Just like ""the Shining"", its widely considered to be a horror movie, and it is, but, once again, its very different from what we call a horror movie nowadays. Also, very much like in ""The Shining"", there's a good portion of the darkest humour possible and, I swear, its lovely. Its witty, its funny, well, its just natural in every aspect of it. Its definitely in my top 5. Go make yourself a favor - watch this movie, preferably in a movie theater, like I did. There's everything you can ever expect from a good movie, and even more."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","5","8","5 December 2005"," Superb but not particularly scary (spoilers throughout)
","Even though I think Rosemary's Baby is a fantastic film, I wouldn't really class it as particularly scary. If anything it's more of a dark comedy. Pregnancy is the joke and giving birth to the child of Satan is the punch line.<br/><br/>But that's not to say that the film doesn't have its moments. The dreams are certainly creepy. Indeed, the way that Polanski films Satan having sex with Farrow with a bunch old Satanists watching would probably put the willies up most expectant mothers (so to speak). But then again, maybe that's my problem as regards finding the film scary. I'm never going to be giving birth, so I'll never know what it's like to be in that position.<br/><br/>However, the film does do an excellent job of portraying the helplessness of pregnancy and the paranoia that can come about with no longer having control of your own body. Rosemary starts the film as an able woman, a woman who can choose an apartment and make decisions, but once she's pregnant she's ruled by doctors, nosey neighbours and her husband. Suddenly she's passive and suddenly her own importance is downgraded. It's as if she's a mere incubator.<br/><br/>I'm sure that's something a lot of women must feel when they're pregnant. They must feel like conduits. But Rosemary's Baby takes that idea and takes it to extremes.<br/><br/>One of the most amusing things about Rosemary's Baby is its Satanists. Here you have a coven populated mainly by wrinklies and old codgers. Never before have old people been so evil. But then again, are they really that evil? I mean, Rosemary's neighbours provide her with chocolate moose and herb drinks. What's wrong with that? Well, I guess there's a bit of a moral failing when the moose knocks Rosemary out so that Beelzebub can rape her. And I suppose Satan could have at least been a gentleman and date-raped her the old-fashioned way - with a drink and some Rohypnol. But they're mere formalities. And besides, the result would have been the same. But I do like the way that Rosemary doesn't eat all the knockout moose and is partially aware of having sex with the Devil. It adds to the weird helplessness of the scene. The whole thing is like a night terror. Indeed, despite thinking it's real while experiencing it, she puts it down to a dream. After all, it's too crazy to be true, isn't it? <br/><br/>Watching the film again it's fun seeing how the conspiracy works. I mean, when you first watch it, you're not sure whether Rosemary is just going insane. You don't know whether it's mere paranoia. But while the weird chanting through the walls stuck out during the first viewing, when I watched it again I noticed how Rosemary's husband goes off to meet alone with their Satanist neighbours. He's obviously being seduced. Then there's the offhand way that Minnie (one of the neighbours) asks whether Rosemary wants children. It's done in such a light way  Minnie herself doesn't even seem interested in the answer  that when you first view it, you kind of miss this obsessive interest. But you've also got the herb drink, the doctor, the moose, the way that her husband runs off to tell the neighbours about the pregnancy and the way that one of her friends, an old man who is the only voice of dissent when it comes how the pregnancy is handled, goes into a coma and dies. Rosemary is right to be paranoid. Things are going on behind her back.<br/><br/>And that's part of the film's genius, especially in the way it's directed. Rosemary is the focus of everything. She's in every scene and everything is from her viewpoint. Therefore you can never be sure, when you first watch it, whether it's just a fantasy. And Mia Farrow is a big factor in the film's success. Among some actresses there could be a tendency to overplay things, but she plays it as a woman desperately trying to keep control. Only when things go absolutely insane does she resort to hysterics. Consequently, you like her and you want everything to work out for her. And it's also quite winning the way that she gets her haircut during her pregnancy to try and reaffirm her identity and importance, and the way that she talks to her baby when she starts to seriously loose it. She's a woman pushed to the limit, but she's a woman who fights it admirably.<br/><br/>And that likability works for the ending. When she finally sees her baby and what it is, you wonder what she's going to do and you actually care. And the fact that she doesn't kill it and that she begins to embrace it (by rocking the crib with an almost misty look on her face) makes it rather sad. But when you think about it, it's not too absurd that she'd become a mother to Satan's child. I mean, just look at some kids today. Would this kid really be much worse? And I'm sure that being Satan's concubine must have certain perks. But seriously, how often do you hear, ""he's got a face only a mother can love""? And people always speak of 'little devils'. The maternal instinct is strong.<br/><br/>But although the ending is creepy and sad, at the same time I find it funny. Just take the way that all the old fogies start shouting, ""Hail Satan!"" Or the way that the oriental guy snaps photos. Then there's the woman rocking the crib and fact that the scheming neighbour says that the baby has his father's eyes. There's a lot of dark humour in the film and the ending is where it comes through strongest. But that doesn't mean that the joke is funny for poor Rosemary."
"JAM-31","Null","5","8","3 November 2002"," This one gave me nightmares
","I found this film disturbingly scary on a level I'd compare to ""The Exorcist.""  It won't affect everyone the same way--I've yet to see a decent horror film that didn't terrify one viewer and humorously amuse another with indifference.  But this one should affect anyone with an active imagination. <br/><br/>Imagination is what makes this film so disturbing.  I know it is a cliche to say that ""less is more,"" and that scenes of horror that are ""implied"" are more successful than those that show it explicitly.  But ""Rosemary's Baby"" does more than that--it almost displays everything that is happening in front of us in a banal way, so that we accept it at face value, without shock, until it is too late.  <br/><br/>The story starts out rather happily, and non-threatening.  A young, attractive couple is searching for an apartment in New York City.  They meet an old, eccentric couple living in the apartment above them who seem rather intrusive and annoying, but we accept these characteristics as the affects of aging and loneliness.  A series of strange events occur, some of them involving deaths.  But we are not frightened by any of them yet.  They accelerate rapidly until the now pregnant Rosemary is obviously in great danger, and so is her unborn baby.  There is a conspiracy against her, but it still is not clear exactly who is involved, who she can trust, and who is leading it.  The answers are right in front of us the whole time, with a final twist that is as disturbing as those from the ""great shockers"" of recent films, including ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Fight Club,"" and ""The Others,"" yet it is not as abrupt.  This is because the story builds to the climax without really hiding much, for the film uses our assumptions against us. The elderly couple CAN'T be poisoning Rosemary could they?  Rosemary's husband HAS to be the one person she can rely on, right?  Rosemary's nightmare that seemed ""so real"" was just a nightmare, wasn't it? <br/><br/>
SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>The vague glimpses of Satan himself fornicating with the heroine are not evident to us until much later.  When we see a group of elderly, seemingly innocuous nude people gathering around and commenting on what is happening, we at first refuse to take it at face value.  After all, it is not just these weird people we see, Rosemary's husband is there (John Cassavettes, ""Franco,"" from ""The Dirty Dozen."")  Cassavettes actually turns out to be, in my opinion, the most evil character here--so self-serving that he actually sells his wife's womb just to further his career.  <br/><br/>The final scene is somewhat campy, but isn't any less frightening.  It is also interesting to see that the people involved in this cult of witches (""All of them Witches"") are really, at heart, ""normal"" elderly people, who knit, tell lots of boring stories, enjoy having visitors out of loneliness, etc.--they just worship Satan!  <br/><br/>***END SPOILERS<br/><br/>In general, I think this film is definitely worth seeing.  How one will react to it is a different story.  I found the grainy film, toned-down special effects (the snake-eyes were very effective), the leisurely pace, and the old-fashioned style of directing by Roman Polansky to be the key factors in the success of this film as a horror movie, or ""thriller.""  All of these elements make us think and force us to use our imagination, and then shudder with revulsion, and the end result seems very real.  If you agree on the success of these elements, watch the film, but be cautious, after all, I again admit that at 28, I had nightmares after seeing it... Grade: A."

"Poseidon-3","Null","8","15","16 August 2005"," Virtually flawless piece of storytelling with Farrow's best work.
","Already a best-selling book when this film was made, the title has now become a pop-culture touchstone and this is regarded as one of the top psychological thrillers of all time. It all starts off nicely enough as married couple Cassavetes and Farrow move into an old, but richly appointed apartment building in New York. Farrow works overtime to transform it from a dark and old-fashioned place into a bright, sunny place to live...the perfect place to have a baby. When Cassavetes is handed a plum stage role, they decide to concentrate on conceiving a child, with the curious encouragement of their oddball, elderly neighbors Blackmer and Gordon. Still recovering from the apparent suicide of their border, the older couple takes a shine to the younger couple and soon have insinuated themselves into their lives. On the night that Farrow is most fertile and the pair had planned to attempt conception, she passes out and experiences a horrific extended dream in which she is raped by a demonic man as onlookers stare determinedly. Or did it actually happen? She finds herself with child, but her pregnancy is a monumentally difficult one, even with all the added attention and nourishment provided by Gordon and her pricey doctor Bellamy. Soon, Farrow realizes that there is far more at work in her life than just prenatal discomfort, but she has a hard time convincing anyone of it. Director Polanski is an absolute master of mood, tension and general unease. He expertly builds the paranoia in this film to an extraordinary level. Farrow (who, in the early sequences of this film is quite possibly at her highest level of attractiveness and appeal) gives an astonishing performance. Though she wasn't initially the actress Polanski wanted (which was Tuesday Weld), it's hard to picture anyone else in the part (none more so than Patty Duke, who appeared in a dire TV sequel in 1976!) She gives the part everything it needs and more: amiability, freshness, sexuality, warmth and most of all vulnerability. She is transformed from a lovely, happy woman into a wraith-like, ghostly stick-figure. (However, in one minor misstep, the makeup people whitened her face, but left her ears tan!) Cassavetes is strong as well, but perhaps overplays his hand a little. He does a decent enough job, but in some ways he isn't right for the part at all. His aspiring actor character is pushing forty and he is sixteen years Farrow's senior. A younger actor (like first choice Robert Redford) may have aided the mystery of the film a little more. Gordon, of course, steals every scene she's in with her brash, fussy ways and her distinctive voice. She was truly a force unto herself and seems to exist in her own atmosphere. Many familiar veteran actors turn up in supporting roles. In some cases, their previously benign personas are given a sick, darkly comic twist. Grodin is shown in one of his very earliest roles as one of Farrow's doctors. Farrow's female friends at her cocktail party are enacted by a trio of interesting actresses. One was Dr. Bellows' wife on ""I Dream of Jeannie"", one was confidant and secretary to ""The Green Hornet"" and the other was a ""Hee Haw"" honey and Mrs. Kenny Rogers! Made prior to the MTV era in which everything must be spelled out, explained and shown in gory detail, this is a deliberately paced chiller that is far more focused on mood and audience manipulation. By the time Farrow is stuck in a phone booth (with famed producer William Castle making a cameo appearance) and frantically seeking assistance, the audience is desperate for her to find some way out of her predicament. It's top notch in all departments and has been cribbed from countless times since. Farrow, who was undergoing unbelievable pressure and personal trauma at the time due to her crumbling marriage to Frank Sinatra was inexplicably left out of the Oscar race that year."

","Rosemary's Baby was a shocker in 1968 when it was released.  Recently screening the film with my wife, I see it still can impart a huge psychological impact today.<br/><br/>My wife did not find it particularly frightening.  It is true, there are no CG demons flying around cutting people's heads off ala End of Days.  It's from an age of film when people actually watched and thought about what was on the screen instead of just being wowed by eye-candy.  As such, it calls upon the viewer to be drawn into Rosemary's plight and paranoia.  And at this, it still succeeds.<br/><br/>I was struck by the fact that, even though there are some telltale signs of it's age (guys readily smoke around the pregnant Rosemary while handing her drinks, etc.), the film holds up so well and appears even today to be remarkably contemporary.  The characters, so well acted, are timeless types of horror:  The nosey old lady (Ruth Gordon) who eventually grows on you and, even after you find out what she's all about, you can't help but find her funny; the benign grandfatherly figure (Sidney Blackmer) and the trusted doctor (Ralph Bellemy) who surely wouldn't harm a fly; and the innocent Rosemary who becomes victim to a justified paranoia.  At the end, my wife asked whether the second doctor (Charles Grodin) was ""in"" on the plot. That's the whole point in a nutshell... you never know.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby was a daring precursor to many films to follow including the Omen and The Exorcist.  While those films use gallons of pea soup and shocking special effects, neither works so hard on your mind as this one.

"sddavis63","7","3","4","29 September 2018"," Not The Classic ""Horror"" Movie You Might Expect - More Of A Psychological Mystery
","This movie is a classic, and 50 years old, and yet strangely enough I had never watched it until now. And, to be honest, it wasn't really what I was expecting it to be. I had the impression that ""Rosemary's Baby"" was more of a straight horror/thriller type of movie. Instead what I found was more of a suspense/mystery type of story. I didn't find there to be anything particularly frightening in it. It was more mysterious, and for me the question hanging over the whole story was whether any of what Rosemary came to believe was real or if it was just a figment of her imagination. I'll give credit to Roman Polanski, who both directed this and wrote the screenplay - there are plenty of scenes and events in this movie that add to that uncertainty. Things happened or would be said that maybe at first seemed innocent, but as they added up I could see how they began to appear suspicious to Rosemary. But there's also enough going on that causes you to think - ""No - this is just Rosemary's imagination going wild."" So, although I have to confess that at first I was struggling with this just a bit (probably because it was so unlike what I was expecting) after a while I became quite fixed on the story. Once you're into it (even if you have to struggle a bit with the beginning) you have to see it through to the end. And I will say this about the ending (which I won't give away) - I don't think the resolution was as clear as some make it out to be. I was still left thinking that what was happening could be real - or maybe was still in Rosemary's mind. If I could hazard a guess I'd say that the intent was that what Rosemary believed turned out to be true, but it just wasn't crystal clear to me.<br/><br/>I had mixed reactions to the performances in this. No one really came across to me as outstanding - this in spite of the fact that Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Minnie Castevet - Rosemary and Guy's annoying neighbour. I truly did find the character annoying - which perhaps does say that Gordon pulled off the part perfectly, but my reaction to the character perhaps clouded my appreciation of Gordon's performance. I would say that if you wanted to make a movie that in some way features Satan, you could do worse than simply have a young couple move in to a new place who then have to put up with Minnie and Roman as their neighbours. ""Neighbours From Hell"" you could call it, even without a supernatural angle! As for Mia Farrow as Rosemary - she grew on me over the course of the picture. At first she seemed a bit wooden for lack of a better word, but I thought she did a good job of portraying Rosemary's ""evolution"" as she begins to suspect that something evil was going on.<br/><br/>This was OK. Once I adjusted my expectations of it - after realizing that it wasn't going to be the traditional horror movie I was expecting - it managed to draw me in. I would say that I think it's perhaps a little bit over-rated, and if you are looking for a traditional horror/thriller type of movie, this is going to be a disappointment. It doesn't have many traditional frights involved with it and it's a little bit slow paced at times. It's a psychological thriller at best; more akin to a mystery than anything. As long as you keep that in mind, it's enjoyable enough. But don't expect to be scared out of your wits, or even to jump or be particularly startled by anything. (7/10)"

The events start off a bit slow at first but once the movie picks up, it keeps us on the edge of our seats and we're left on our seats dying to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the more atmospheric, subtle, and creepy horror films out there. It's really rare that you find a film like this anymore. Most horror films are ""in your face"" nowadays but this one sneaks up on you and messes with your head throughout it.<br/><br/>The score is amazing. The soft motherly voice and the shill instruments get under our skin and it sets up what kind of movie this is. Mia Farrow gave an outstanding performance. She did a great job setting scenes with her facial expressions. The other supporting actors and actresses were great but Mia did the best job.<br/><br/>To be honest though, I saw the ending coming from a mile away. I'm not going to say what it is but it was very predictable. I would've been surprised if my prediction about what I think would happen wasn't correct. During the film, I thought ""I don't think they're going to do this. It would be way too predictable"".<br/><br/>The ending needed work.

","A gorgeous piece of sustained suspense filmmaking. Polanski is leisurely in his pacing and camera-work, with long takes and assured movement. Focusing on the environment, the use of sight and sound, and the performances, to build the story. It's really just a perfect movie. There isn't a wasted shot, nor clunky editing, nor melodrama to be found.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow is perfect as the fragile waif Rosemary, and John Cassavetes does a lot with a role that is intentionally underwritten. He sells everything Guy is going through by sheer force of acting will. Ruth Gordon, who won a hard to contest Oscar, and Sidney Blackmer play the nosey old couple next door to sublime exactness.<br/><br/>Not so much a horror movie, as a story that contains horror elements, although there are moments of terror to be found. Used sparingly and as a result, effectively. Mia's rape scene, with its use of hallucinogenic scenery and flashes of Satan is chilling in its implications. Rosemary's reaction to her first sight of the baby is blood-curdling. But maybe what's most scary is the choice she makes to end the movie. These help the movie to get under your skin, so much so that by the film's climax you don't realize how much stress you've been put under. The movie conveys the paranoia and lonesomeness of Rosemary without drawing attention to itself.<br/><br/>There are plenty of themes explored here. It was 1968, at the height of women's lib and Rosemary is a dependent who has shunned both God and family to get to where she is. She has no sense of self, really, outside of Guy. Her haircut, and then her baby become these things. Is she being punished for not being more independent? Was that her birth by fire into modern womanhood? There's paranoia and xenophobia, about the people next door, the people you think you know (but do you?) and the ""old ways"" all set within one of the most populated cities on the planet, and yet a person can still feel all alone.<br/><br/>A great movie, a great story, doesn't have to be about any one of those themes, but it's all there for the taking. It's small pricklings of common human thinking and modern anxieties that can help fuel the subtext of a good story well told."

","The stylish, ambitious, chaotic mess of 1965's Repulsion was condensed to its purest form in Rosemary's Baby, Polanski's first real masterpiece and, along with Chinatown, his most memorable work. Rosemary's Baby took some cues from Hitchcock's work, but by its own right it revolutionized horror cinema, and had a huge part in inspiring classics from Jaws to The Shining and The Thing - films that took to heart the lesson that nothing is scarier than nothing, and maintain tension and terror throughout with very little actually happening.<br/><br/>Partly thanks to the film's minimalistic nature (most of it takes place in one apartment, not unlike Repulsion) and the refusal to rely on special effects, and partly thanks to Polanski's inspired directorial work, Rosemary's Baby stood the test of time better than any horror film of its time - indeed, better than most films of the 60's. Young viewers more accustomed to slasher horror may scoff at how little happens, but once you start watching the feeling of terror and discomfort grows and it's impossible not to be taken in, especially if you've anywhere near the protagonists' age. Mya Farrow and John Cassavetes are terrific in the leads, probably delivering the most powerful performances in their careers; and their show is nearly stolen by the irritating, charming, creepy, lovable Ruth Gordon (who won a very deserved Oscar for her part).<br/><br/>Very few films are as timeless as Rosemary's Baby, and few are as absorbing and effective. A must-see for every film lover."
"funkyfry","8","3","4","2 November 2007"," memorable atmospheric horror with Ruth Gordon
","Excellent suspenseful direction by Polanksi and a great cast highlight this prototype reproduction-shocker from the late 60s, a film that influenced many horror films to follow including the inferior ""Exorcist."" I love how Polanski lets his camera roam and linger about the massive apartment complex that is the film's central setting, making it the literal eye of the audience. I think maybe my favorite shot in the whole movie is when Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) are talking and she glances at the room where her husband, the appropriately named ""Guy"" (John Cassavetes) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) are talking and we see only the vaguely sinister smoke drifting through the open doorway. I have a feeling that doorways and hallways in general have a symbolic significance in this film tied to its paranormal ruminations on pregnancy, but I'd have to rewatch it to analyze that aspect of the film.<br/><br/>The story takes a little while to get going, but once we're into Rosemary's pregnancy the stakes begin to rise and suspense is unrelenting. There's also some great macabre humor thrown into the mix which reaches its apex in the film's famous ""shocker"" ending. It's a very atmospheric horror without any gore and with only minimal scares, to the extent that it reminds me of Jacques Tourneur's horror films (indeed given Polanski's status as a Francophile it's almost certain he had seen and been inspired by his films).<br/><br/>The music is also very memorable; I was already familiar with the tune from the album by ""Fantomas"" with Mike Patton where they did a heavy metal cover of it, recommended for fans of this movie.<br/><br/>But best of all are the performances from all 4 of the leads. Gordon and Blackmer are the highlight of the film for me with their wicked subversion of normal ""nice old neighbor"" type performances. Gordon of course was herself a brilliant writer and probably recognized the high quality of the material she was working with here. She's a fussy old lady who hides her true evil intent behind a blustering annoying façade of the old lady who's just a little bit too helpful. Blackmer is a good tonic to her high energy performing, projecting a reassuring feeling that greatly helps in the final scene when he gently rocks the cradle. The implication of that scene, that the maternal instinct will win out over all other reasoning, is powerful and ironic. Cassavetes isn't perfect but he is suitable in the role, the only one of the ""villains"" who actually had me guessing during much of the film's running time. And Farrow is a visual of gaunt helplessness, her eyes conveying fear and loss of control throughout the second half of the film. It's interesting that Polanksi says he initially envisioned a more ""corn-fed"" starlet in the role, specifically Tuesday Weld. In my opinion Tuesday Weld was a better actress than Mia Farrow and probably would have provided the film with an even more powerful feeling. It's true that Farrow looks perfect in the early phases of her pregnancy when she's losing weight and becoming paler, but she's already so thin in the first place that I think it would have been even more shocking to see Weld in the same situation. But I really can't fault Farrow's performance besides just the physical aspects of her screen presence which she isn't in control of. It's obvious that she and Polanski were on the same wavelength, and it's extraordinary how the male director and female star were able to make the character such a strong cipher for the audience."

But as so many reviewers here note quite well, the film is not your conventional horror flick, but something quite different, that uses atmosphere and mood to weave an eerie spell to stay with you long after the film is over.<br/><br/>Seeing the film once is enough, but seeing it again really brings out the humor and pathos in this strange tale. Lines like the one Rosemarie says to her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), when she feels her baby kicking and notices he's shy about putting his hand on her belly: ""Don't be scared, it won't bite."" Or the strange girl Rosemary meets in the laundry room of the ""Black Bram,"" full of gratitude to the couple that took her in. ""Real grandparents,"" the girl calls them. ""They picked me up off the sidewalk."" The sidewalk is where she ends up, though, a few minutes later, one of the first signs something's wrong.<br/><br/>Minutely faithful to Ira Levin's novel, Polanski nevertheless frames his film in such an imaginative way as to make it feel alive, and thus more chilling as it goes on, with its attention to Upper East Side decor, summer dresses that resemble paisley sofa covers, and of course the baroque architecture of the Bramford, i.e. the real-life Dakota apartments, whose own unhappy history give this film a guilty kick.<br/><br/>That's too bad, because the film would stand up as well without any tragic real-life subtext. Farrow's performance (shades of Jean Seberg) is an amazing display of an actress in complete control as her character spins farther out of it. Though she was deprived of so much as an Oscar nomination (at least the Golden Globes weren't as asleep at the wheel), Ruth Gordon did win an Oscar playing a neighbor whose amiable kookiness conceals nasty depth, the best of a supporting cast that doesn't miss a trick, whether it be Ralph Bellamy as an unorthodox obstetrician or Elisha Cook as a fey doorman.<br/><br/>The only performance many have caveats about is Cassavetes. Would not Robert Redford had worked better in the role of the struggling, amoral actor? Yet I find myself liking Cassavetes better the more I watch this film, his guilty laughter as he urges Rosemary to finish her chocolate ""mouse"" and wear her smelly charm. He really nails a deeper sense of evil on offer, with his callous comments to Rosemary and his nasty way with a joke, at peace with a world that can ask, on the cover of Time magazine: ""Is God Dead?"" Existential dread is at the heart of this film, and Guy presents a post-Christian figure that Cassavetes nails down from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Polanski and Farrow give the best work. He frames every shot with the kind of depth and focus that reminds you of Hitchcock at his peak, while she, eerily resembling Twiggy, sets a standard for '60s glamour and acting prowess that makes you wonder how she failed to find worthy projects in the next decade. It wasn't really until the 1980s, as Woody Allen's muse, that she had the opportunity to develop a real body of work. It's like this film had some kind of curse on it.<br/><br/>Of course, talking about curses and ""Rosemary's Baby"" makes you realize Mia got off rather lightly in comparison. My random music machine just played selections from John Lennon and Frank Sinatra in tandem, and now I really have the creeps. So will you, when you give this a chance. Creepiness is a harder trick to pull off in movies than raw shock, and here is a film that sets a standard few, if any, have come close to matching."

","Rosemary's Baby is one of the most controversial films of our time. I can't stop thinking about how sweet and nice Ruth Gordon was in her Academy award winning role. I loved her as Minnie even though she proved that even appearances can be truly deceiving. Who would ever thought that you lived next door to Satanists in New YOrk City. I felt sorry for Mia Farrow's character, Rosemary, but she does give the performance of her career. The haircut by Vidal Sassoon has been etched in my memory since I saw it on television. THe conception of her baby was hard to swallow and not for the squeamish like myself. John Cassavetes also gives a memorable, unforgettable performance as her husband willing to sell his wife out for a successful acting career. You never really like the character because of his immoral actions. As Rosemary comes closer to the truth, we are equally horrified by her discovery of her husband's new allegiance and the satanists who look so ordinary like Aunt Bee from the Andy Griffith Show. You never see them as anything but ordinary and that proves that the nicest, kindest neighbors can fool you. Ruth Gordon's performance as Minnie is well chilling. I won't give away the ending but I bet everybody knows it. A Satanist was consulted on the film and he was connected to Charles Manson whose gang murdered the director's wife. It's more horrifying than the film itself. While I get goosebumps about this story, it won't just leave you. You will always wondered what happened to that baby. Polanski who survived the holocaust as a child always knows how to remind you that people even the sweetest looking people in the world can be evil too."

","For its genre, and really, for any genre, this film is a perfect film. Why is it so perfect? In my humble opinion, it is all in the absolutely superb storytelling. All of the dialog that slowly ensues throughout the movie offers the audience little clues bit by bit, unbeknownst to us, however. Unless you believe Rosemary from the outset at the point at which she begins to suspect what's happening to her, you really need to wait until the end of the film to see what was in store all along. And once you're at the end of the film, if you take a moment and think back of all the dialog served up by all the principles and key supporting players throughout the film...the Castevets (""my work takes me all over the world""), Hutch, Dr. Saperstein, Dr. Hill (""I need to take a blood sample from you...uhhh, a blood test""), and the sudden professional luck of Guy Woodhouse, it all becomes eerily plausible, and a perfectly (and sick, of course) planned scenario. I never read the book, but, I wonder if there are even more characters in on the whole plot. At any rate, this film presents a masterpiece of suspenseful and perfectly metered storytelling, and for this reason, I call it a perfect film."

","""Rosemary's Baby"" rules. One of Ira Levin's best stories makes an effortless translation to the big screen thanks to a script that sticks very close to the source, a stellar cast, and the craft of Roman Polanski.<br/><br/>The weird thing about ""Rosemary's Baby"" is that it's generally considered to be a horror movie, and yet there is very little of the supernatural in it. Sure it involves a coven of witches who conspire to impregnate Rosemary with child of the devil himself, but aside from one hallucinatory scene where the devil may actually manifest, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is really a conspiracy film. The horror is not in the fact that Rosemary is going to give birth to the Devil's child; we already know this going into the film. What's scary about it is how Rosemary is completely unaware that something terrible has happened to her, and that her husband has sold her out. Even after she begins to catch on that something weird is happening, she doesn't realize how bad it really is. It's not that the witches want her baby, it's that they already *have* her baby. The baby's father is, literally, Satan. <br/><br/>It's compelling to see the way Rosemary is deceived throughout the film. One of the most chilling scenes is when Rosemary finds someone she thinks she can confide in and then finds that they, too, have turned her over to the people that intend to exploit her. It's as if, in all of New York, she can't find a single person who isn't in on it. The ones that aren't in on it...die.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow is the best thing about this movie, although everyone else is good, too. Farrow looks so delicate and vulnerable that you can't help but want to shield her somehow from what's going on. Watch the way the film portrays the coven, too. They're sinister, but other than their wicked intentions and the fact that they worship Satan, they're only a bunch of daffy old people.<br/><br/>I find that many people are put off by their own expectations of the film. They go into it as if they're going to see a devil baby in it, which is simply a footnote in the film. By the time Rosemary sees the result of her unholy pregnancy, the horror has already happened to her. She doesn't realize she's been a victim until it's all over."
"BaronBl00d","10","3","4","19 September 1999"," One of the Best!
","Undoubtedly, this film is certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made.  It is a chilling psycho-drama, a social commentary, and a good old-fashioned horror yarn all at once.  The story, of course, concerns a young Rosemary Woodhouse and her husband's journey in becoming tenants of a huge Brownstone called the Bram, where many evil, mysterious things have happened to/with its tenants over its long history.  The story unfolds, and we are caught up in what Rosemary sees, hears, and even thinks.  We feel her pain, anxiety, paranoia, and even fear.  We sense conspiracy all around us and want nothing more than security for her and her child to come.  This is due in large part to the masterful direction of one of the greatest directors of the screen...Roman Polanski.  Polanski shows us just enough and lets are imaginations kick in and conceive the horrors around us as only are minds can conjure.  The acting is extremely good in this film and it is in many ways a character actor's dream.  Ruth Gordon deservedly won an oscar for her portrayal of the nosy, loquacious Minnie Castavet.  Sidney Blackmer, playing her husband, also is equally good as an elderly man seemingly polite and good-natured but seething with hatred, evil, and delight in the pain of others.  Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, and Maurice Evans are also memorable in their roles.  Mia Farrow is very convincing as is her husband John Cassavetes.  William Castle, the great showman of the movies, produced this gem, and unquestionably it was his greatest collaborative effort. First-rate direction, top-notch acting, one heck of a good script based on Ira Levin's masterpiece of simplicity in story-telling all lead to one heck of a good film!"

","Poor young Rosemary!  She doesn't have an opinion she can really call her own; lives through the impending success of her stage-actor husband, Guy Woodhouse, fills her empty days alone in their new, creepy ""Standard Eight"" apartment, picking shelf paper, designing the nursery (is there any other color on the primary wheel than yellow, egads!); and, ultimately, is seemingly betrayed by the whole of Manhattan. Ok, I've already given you more than an appetizer, if you're the last person on Earth that hasn't seen it or read Ira Levin's book on which this Polanski chiller is based. It is the first ""Serious Horror"" film, and set the precedent for subsequent films and novels on Urban Paranoia, borderline Cultisms, and whatever else shamelessly borrows from this, Levin's Opus Magnum.  Don't expect to see much blood or post natal puppets; This film's not about that, so grow up. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is about our reactions to horror, and not the horrors themselves.

Horror of knowing that you watched a movie for two hours and twenty minutes for nothing - that is a scary thought, horror worthy. Nothing else! I am not sure what type of a movie is this. It can be a drama. Thriller is not. Even though there is a premise that the baby is devil, this can not be called a sci - fi or supernatural movie... I don't know. It is just a very confusing one with all the strange for nothing scenes/dreams. <br/><br/>Aside the fact that it is not a horror ( which I expected and why I gave it a try) it is not entirely bad. I can appreciate the acting of the main woman character. It was kinda a bit interesting to see the fashion of the 60's ... But, no positive points aside from that. <br/><br/>Maybe it is just that I am not a fan of old(er) movies...Though, I do know to appreciate a good one when I see, no matter when it was filmed ( I believe).<br/><br/>This one is not really interesting ( though it is not completely boring).

","During the past centuries, the Santanic rituals of the Black mass have been updated so often, it has caused many a coven to rewrite their purpose. Servants of the Black arts are no longer bound by cannon law. Indeed, modern films depict followers with a definite role and their agenda empowers women to believe they are the foundation of man's ultimate fate. Case in point. "" Rosemary's Baby "" written by Ira Levin in 1967 was adapted for the screen in 1968. The story is of a young couple who move into a New York Apartment called 'the Bramford' a building with a haunting past. There, Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse (John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow) are befriended by Mr. and Mrs Castevet,(Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) an elderly couple who take an abiding interest in their new neighbors. Guy is a struggling actor who's stage career instantly improves with their help. Rosemary is interested in having children but suddenly discovers, Mrs. Castevet has invaded her life with intrusive advice and puzzling instructions. Eventually she evolves into a surrogate Mother-in-law. Following a nightmarish rape during a Satanic ritual, Rosemary becomes pregnant. There after the selected mother to be is smothered with attention and begins to doubt whether the attention is directed at anything but her child. Frightening in it's approach, the movie lays the foundation for a terrifying ordeal and the cast which includes Maurice Evans, Ralph Bellamy and Elisha Cook Jr. does a terrific take on the original novel.

"actorAVENUE","10","4","6","9 February 2009"," The greatest horror film of all time!
","by naturalACTOR- The only newer horror film (say, 90's to present) that ever even slightly scared me, surprisingly, was ""The Blair Witch Project"". Notably, ""The Sixth Sense"" had one quite terrifying scene, but contained nothing else that was truly ""scary"". It's so hard to find an amazing horror title today that I've almost given up trying. Rosemary's Baby (1968) is not only a film that (no joke here) cannot be watched alone, but is the scariest, most horrifying film of all time.<br/><br/>It's difficult to break it all down, because there is so much that contributes to the sheer fear this movie gives off. Firstly, Roman Polanski directs with some magic here, conjuring a well-written script into a haunting visual masterpiece. It is creepy how this film is so real, how the idea within its story doesn't seem very fictional. Mia Farrow plays Rosemary with frightening, twisted emotion. Her character even seems a little eerie at times when she begins to go too far with her accusations, and speaks as if somebody tortured her. John Cassavetes is unpredictable, and his character unreadable. He gives a solid performance, and Ruth Gordon, in her Oscar-winning portrayal of Minnie Castevet, brings the only light to this film, brewing a mix of nosiness and hilarity to her character.<br/><br/>I've found that films about Satanists are the very scariest, including this one and Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" (1977). The film is shot smartly, and in a way that keeps the mystery, fear, and suspense tingling right to the very end. Again, Polanski is very masterful and careful about how he works this film, and how he directs his actors. If I had to pick the main reasons why this movie is so scary, and why it makes my hairs stick up so tall, it would have to be the camera work and directing, the story and script and how brilliantly it's played out, the simple feel and atmosphere, so unpredictable and creepy, the acting, done with malice and originality that I am still afraid to think about, and finally, the music.<br/><br/>Krzysztof Komeda composes the most haunting, and definitive horror film score, a lullaby that produces goosebumps and that gets the mind racing through tunnels of fear, through darkness, acting as almost a prelude to what is to happen in the film. It would even be plausible to say that the wild, satanic flute music, and mainly the original score, account for almost all of the film's alarming mountain of horror.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a unique horror film, one that is immensely scary, and also very well made. Never again will there be a better film of its kind. Polanski creates an air of dooming, prevalent fear and musically and plot-driven terror, but the greatest thing he achieves is the surpassing of Hitchcock's greatest works, in the same style--playing his own game, and coming out on top."
"andrewtowne-1","10","4","6","23 July 2008"," This movie is superb in every way
","""Rosemary's Baby"" mixes paranoia with dark humor, and the result is a classic.<br/><br/>I can only suppose that director Roman Polanski drew on the experiences of his childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland in putting his unique stamp on this movie (the murder of his wife Sharon Tate had not yet occurred.) <br/><br/>Ira Levin, who wrote the book on which this movie is based, deserves a lot of credit. The creepy names of the characters -- ""Roman and Minnie Castavet,"" "" Dr. Sapirstein"" -- add a disturbing sense of authenticity to this tale of old-fashioned black magic in what many might otherwise regard as the capital of modern sophistication and skepticism -- New York City.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with ironic juxtaposition, and that is the basis for much of its humor. <br/><br/>The choice of the Gothic and turreted Dakota apartment building (where John Lennon lived and died -- but that had not yet happened) is entirely appropriate. <br/><br/>The folksy neighborliness of the Castavets is especially disturbing in light of their true intentions, and Ruth Gordon gives an outstanding performance as Minnie Castavet. <br/><br/>The power of this movie lies in its many details -- the sets, the costumes, the lighting, the music, the dialog...It all comes together wonderfully -- at least until the last few minutes. <br/><br/>At that point -- when it is clear that the very worst fears have been realized -- it is an open question whether the ending is as good as it might have been. I felt very satisfied in that regard. The impulse to love in spite of horror is very powerful if not entirely convincing. But even if you don't agree, I believe this movie is still very close to being perfect."

","One thing I love about this film is its strangely cosy atmosphere, and the way it's confined almost completely to people's homes (Guy and Rosemary, Hutch, the Castevets). In those homes people do ordinary things - they dish up food, they grow herbs, wash up, redecorate. It's like a page out of Good Housekeeping. And Rosemary is surrounded by sweet, kindly older people (Hutch, the Castevets, Laura Louise). But then they turn out to be... waah, waah, waah waah! On watching it again (and again, and again) I noticed that the camera is right in among the actors a lot of the time, the frame sometimes cutting off their head or half their body. This makes you feel you're really there with them, not watching them on a stage or through a picture frame. And everybody speaks naturally - not a method ""naturalistic"" mumble, but the real thing. All the characters have their own way of speaking (""Call me - not your Aunt Fanny!""), and for a lot of the time they are talking about mundane things like making a window seat or picking up eggs from the store. The setting is fabulous (I keep trying to work out the plan of the apartment and how it fits onto the Castevets'). The casting is brilliant. Ruth Gordon, Sydney Blackmer, Elisha Cook Jr., Patsy Kelly, Maurice Evans, Mia and John. As someone else pointed out, Guy is much older than Rosemary, and though handsome he's short, and he's never made it as an actor. Are they living on her money? Even his attempts at taking off the neighbours (""on account of it's one of her specialitays"") are lame. He constantly laughs at things that aren't funny. The music, even when it's just a descending chromatic scale, is brilliantly creepy, and I love the theme song (sung beautifully by Mia)."

","Polanski's first American film is one of the most enduring films of the 60's. Well-received when released in 1968, Rosemary's Baby is that rare film that grows more impressive with repeated viewings. It's a near perfect, multi-layered classic that mixes psychological horror with supernatural suspense while being funny, scary, and ironic. No remake could ever come close and the spate of films it inspired, most notably the The Exorcist and The Omen, pale by comparison. Expertly directed by Polanski, the film is perfectly cast and splendidly acted by all. Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for supporting actress, but Farrow, who is in every scene, wasn't even nominated for her iconic portrayal. The entire film is told from Rosemary's point of view. The growing sense of menace and paranoia is beautifully handled, and the audience is with Farrow and her unborn child every step of the way. On one level Rosemary's Baby is the ultimate tribute to motherhood. A winner any way you look at it. Consider it essential viewing. Among others, French film director Francois Truffaut expressed great admiration for the film, and Rosemary's Baby deserved a place on the AFI's top 100."

The acting is expert, especially Mia Farrow's hugely underrated performance as the impressionable Rosemary. Roman Polanski's direction is perfect; he eschews the shock horror approach used by directors like William Friedkin and instead creates a subtly creepy atmosphere, ratcheting up the tension gradually until you're ready to jump out of your skin. The production design and cinematography are off-kilter in ways you can't quite define. And the musical score, all plucked strings and jangling piano chords (except for the sinister lullaby that opens the film), is nerve-wracking.<br/><br/>Because every element of the film comes together so well, this supernatural tale feels as realistic as it could possibly be, and one feels that if there is indeed such a thing as the coming of an Anti-Christ, it would happen something like this.<br/><br/>With John Cassavetes, superbly slimy as the sell-out husband; Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, as the Jewish grandma and grandpa from Hell (literally); Ralph Bellamy as a crooked doctor; and, most effectively, Maurice Evans, poor Rosemary's only ally.<br/><br/>Any number of scenes could qualify as creepiest, but my personal favorite is the one in which Rosemary uses a Scrabble game set to make sense of an anagram.

","This movie means so much to me. It is exceptional in every sense of the word. It is a film that demands to be viewed more than once, and unlike most horror movies, where repeated viewing dulls the experience, this film only becomes more terrifying as you watch it again and again getting more and more caught up in the conspiracy that surrounds Rosemary.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow is the living, breathing heart of this movie. Appearing in every scene, her delicate portrayal of the beautifully innocent Rosemary Wodehouse provides a stark opposition to the disturbing nature of the movie's true subject. How she didn't win 1968's Best Actress Oscar is beyond me, let alone the fact that she wasn't even nominated.<br/><br/>Polanski's obsession with imbuing the mundane with sinister qualities has never been more effective than in this, his masterpiece (some may argue Chinatown or Repulsion as deserving that title, but Rosemary's Baby takes it simply for the way it manipulates its audience at the same time as forcing them to become emotionally involved in a truly outlandish plot). He is aided here by the film's setting, the creepy Bramford. The film begins with a long-shot of the New York skyline. Komeda's eerily melodic lullaby is being sweetly sung over the pink curly credits by Mia Farrow as the camera eventually settles on the Gothic Bramford building, nestled malevolently amongst the innocuous houses and apartment complexes of modern New York City. As the newlyweds Guy and Rosemary settle in to their newly purchased apartment it becomes increasingly obvious that every step Rosemary takes in search of a modern domestic bliss is in fact sucking her in to a nightmarishly evil scenario beyond her imagination.<br/><br/>Farrow is ably supported by the wonderful Ruth Gordon as the sinisterly over-solicitous next door neighbour and John Cassavetes (who famously clashed with Polanski onset) as her devilishly handsome actor husband. But Farrow is the star, and the year IS 1966, so although we never get to lay eyes on the eponymous baby, our thoughts are never far from him, his deceived mother and, of course, the lurking presence of his father."

","When I just heard the lullaby theme in the title, I freaked out. That theme alone was one of the freakiest thing I'd ever heard. Yet, I didn't know what was to come; the la-la-la was just the starting of it. I ended up watching the best horror film I'd ever seen in my life. Before that, my fav horror film was ""Jaws."" No offense to Steven Spielburg, but not even that could top this masterpiece.<br/><br/>I was already familiar with Roman Polanski's work before, so I knew what to expect. I was wrong about expecting a good movie. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is so much more than that. Polanski really made every scene right and good-paced so that we'd still be at the edge of our seats to the end.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow was the perfect actress for the film's brave and young-motherly protagonist. She kept Rosemary's emotions and thoughts right on her face so we know what she's thinking at all times and we can actually join her emotionally in her desperate fight to save her baby from the coven. No one else could have done so.<br/><br/>The ending is probably one of the best climax ever filmed in history, somewhere right below ""Taxi Driver."" I think they made a good choice not showing the baby. Rosemary's reaction alone was enough to show that something was wrong with it. Had they shown it, all our shock would have spilled out no matter how freaky it looked and the film's macabre-less suspense would have been ruined.<br/><br/>The shock still continues to the very end, when Rosemary decides to accept her Antichrist son. She wanted this baby her whole life and she's going to love it, even if it's the son of Satan. Everyone would gasp at this and think that surely she doesn't know what she's doing, but she does. And this makes the film's theme be not about religion or good and evil at all, but just that a true mother's love must reach beyond all obstacles, even a relation to evil itself."

","This is indeed a rare film, a sublime masterpiece, Roman Polanski's crowning achievement. Based upon the likewise-flawless novel by Ira Levin and virtually unaltered by Polanski, Rosemary's Baby is a work of art, a classic which stands alone to this day, never to be surpassed.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story by now; Mia Farrow is the sweet and innocent Rosemary Woodhouse who, along with her actor/husband Guy, finds the perfect apartment in New York. Despite a disreputable history, it seems the catalyst of good fortune for the happily married young couple. Their friendly, if somewhat brassy, neighbors are played to absolute perfection by Ruth Gordon (who received an Oscar for her efforts) and Sidney Blackmer. Despite some foreboding nightmares and the unfortunate accidental (?) death of a young woman, life is good for Rosemary and her husband, whose acting career seems to finally be taking off. But there's always a price to pay for good fortune. Unbeknownst to poor Rosemary, her husband has literally made a deal with the Devil. Shortly after a romantic dinner, some chalky chocolate mousse and the mother of all nightmares in which Rosemary is raped by a beast whilst her neighbors and husband look on, Rosemary discovers she is pregnant. But the pregnancy is a difficult one, her neighbors are not what they seem and the inevitable closes in around her over the course of nine long months time. Rosemary comes to believe that she and the baby are in danger, that her baby is a potential sacrificial victim for a coven of witches. The truth, however, is much, much worse.<br/><br/>I've always thought of Rosemary's Baby as the blackest of black comedies, and of Rosemary as the butt of a very long and drawn-out practical joke. Fans of modern day horror films, used to gory death scenes and disposable heroes, will probably not appreciate the pace at which this film moves or its wry sense of humor. This is indeed a shame, because this film is everything that a good horror film should be; intelligent, subtle and almost rather dismissive of its own brilliance. The films climax is practically shrugged off by the characters who have brought it about. And Rosemary finally realizes that perhaps the only way to beat them is to join them; there is no fiercer predator than a mother defending her child, and as she accepts her role as the Mary of the Profane, we must wonder; will she triumph after all?<br/><br/>I've hesitated to review this film for a long time, simply because I couldn't think of anything to say about it that hasn't already been said. It's a masterpiece, a work of art, an inspiration for many films to come, some good and some not so good. It continues to loom large over the genre, virtually untouchable and yet always accessible. No fan of film - horror or otherwise - should miss this. It truly deserves every word of praise it has ever earned."

","I had heard a lot about this movie for a long time but I had not had the chance to see it until recently. And I must say that at first I wasn't that impressed. For the first 30-40 minutes not a lot of stuff seemed to happen, but after the truly horrifying rape scene (a great depiction of ""was-it-a-dream or reality"") I was bolted to my couch watching the enchanting Mia Farrow grow more and more into the frenzy of thinking she is impregnated with the child of Satan himself. I am now convinced that I should go see this movie again to catch all the details director Roman Polanski must have put in those first 30-40 minutes.<br/><br/>Like in other movies in Polanski's early work (i.e. Knife In The Water) this was so well-paced that as a watcher you are lured into this false sense of security just like Rosemary is, but underneath horrible things are happening to her that are unspeakable.<br/><br/>Another thing about this film was the feel to it. I was convinced that this movie was made in 1978 or something but later on I checked my Maltin guide and read that it was actually from 1968! How's that for a surprise. This looks and feels like a seventies film but it's not!<br/><br/>The role of Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castavet was played to perfection to once again give the audience that feeling that such nice neighbours would not be capable of doing something so horrible and give us the dilemma in which we are driven to thinking that it is Rosemary who is dillusional and is making all this up. A deserved Oscar for this lady.<br/><br/>Sheer brilliance, a definite must have on DVD.<br/><br/>10/10"
"figenozel20","4","6","11","18 May 2011"," You will become like the others whether you want or not
","Not only is Roman Polanski a sensational director, but he is a talented and smart director as well. His life is rather complicated so a good story can be produced from his life. As for the movie, it is not a really horror movie because it hasn't any slashing, blood, or scare factors. It is just a psychological supernatural thriller but one of the great thrillers of all time. The casting is great. After a while you may have the feeling as their characters are real. Mia Farrow is perfect in the lead role. Ruth Gordon, who wins Oscar, is also great as the colorful, eccentric, and annoying old neighbor. I was deeply affected by her, somehow. She gave me the shivers whenever she rings the doorbell. I think Ruth Gordon rightfully deserved Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br/><br/>I'd like to draw attention to some points which should be queried in the movie. For example, it is weird that Rosemary without hesitation accepts the unknown herbal drink that is given by her neighbor Minnie. How could you drink it every day even if it is given by your neighbor? You do not know what it is or how it is made. She could at least have wanted to see the herb and its make. The another point is that Rosemary never suspects her baby. She combines the clues wrongly. She just thinks that her baby will be killed by the neighbors who are witches and she runs away from them. She should have understood that there was something wrong about her baby. As long as she runs away, she realizes she will not get rid of them. She abandons herself to her fate and face the fact in the end. His husband winks at her impregnation by Satan in order to become a famous actor (Actually I doubt about her husband whether he is from one of the witches from the beginning) and he says it to her face shamelessly. Rosemary gives birth to the baby of Satan. At first she cannot admit this fact but then she cannot stand his cry. She looks at her baby compassionately so that this look makes us said ""That is the motherhood"".<br/><br/>On the whole the message of the movie is that ""It is really hard to find a sense of trust in social life so you will be defiled and become like the others whether you want or not""."

","So this was an award winning film, eh? A movie that currently ranks #209 on IMDb's top 250? A movie that I was told is not only one of the best horror movies ever, but one of the best movies of the 1960's among all genre's. I think that's utter crap, because I found this movie to be flat out ridiculous. Not only was it incredibly boring, but the acting in this movie (and that includes the Actress who won Best Supporting Actress) was very hammy. And why is it that this movie seemed to have no build up what so ever? Everything just seem repeated. It's made obvious very quickly that the whole situation isn't just paranoia. After that, the entire movie is just redundant. The neighbors are established as oddball devil-worshippers (you even see it in the goofy rape sequence), then that idea just keeps being repeated through events in the plot. It's made apparent that somethings wrong with Rosemary's pregnancy...then that idea just keeps being repeated through events in the plot. It's literally unbearable, and this is coming from someone who enjoys simmering & brooding movies. After over two hours of going in a circle, this movie built up to an ending that was seen coming from the onset? And I'm supposed to be thrilled about that? There were no scares and there was no suspense, absolutely nothing. Honestly, if you have trouble sleeping at night, this movie should do you some justice, but other then the use for Insomnia, this movie is practically worthless."

You'll realize quickly that the screenwriters high school English teacher forgot to explain the whole issue of ""show, don't tell"" to him. The characters have no depth or complexity, they're all black and white contributors to a black and white story line. This movie could have spent two hours developing the difficulty of the characters situations and trying to watch the audience empathize with them, instead you'll barely be able to empathize with the protagonist. Instead it leaves the audience sitting around expecting a plot twist, a change of direction, something. Nope. After the first twenty minutes, turn it off, you'll have already seen the whole movie."

","I watched this movie for the first time yesterday, mostly to see Mia Farrow after she had left ""Peyton Place"". I found that the premise of the movie and the hidden messages within are very powerful, indeed.<br/><br/>I quickly saw that what has been called a ""classic Horror movie"" was really a Gothic spoof of the ""GOD IS DEAD"" movement that was in full force at the time of the writing. Rosemary even picks up a TIME magazine with the cover words, ""IS GOD DEAD""?<br/><br/>In analyzing the scenes with the child, and listening to the liturgy of the satanic cult, it is clear that the message of the movie/book was: Life does not exist in a vacuum, you must choose to believe in good and evil. If you choose to believe in JUST evil, i.e., God is dead, then Rosemary's ultimate world is the world that you would live in. Dark, dead, without hope, and with a Satan-child to worship.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski did a terrific job with the direction of the movie, of course. Mia Farrow was the perfect waif-child to portray the progenitor of Satan's offspring. I did not care for the actor cast as her husband, he never quite settled into the part, but maybe his role was supposed to be ambiguous. The neighbors were funny, not chilling, as was the cult scene at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I would give it a 5 out of 10 because it was a social message disguised as a horror movie....I have to wonder how many people actually realized the subliminal theme?"

The point I'm making here is that during the whole film, I hadn't the slightest clue of what the other characters were saying to one another especially for a 2 hour film like this one!<br/><br/>I didn't understand why Mia Farrow had to cut her hair, is she being held prisoner in her own home by various people? It honestly didn't state to me why she had to do it. In the end, we see that people around her are saying ""Hail Satan"" like why did they say that? Were they Satanists all along? Also why didn't they show the baby to the audience? I would've liked to have seen what the baby was like and not to mention, why did they inject Satan's sperm to Mia Farrows character?<br/><br/>This is a seriously confusing film and I don't understand why they made a fuss about this?

Anyway, so I'm sitting down watching this movie, and for the first hour, I fell asleep five times. The total lack of acting skills, music enhancement, and basic movie production was nowhere to be seen. Typical of high-school film endeavors, I feel that this film is comparable to a reenactment of the book ""Summer of My German Soldier"".<br/><br/>A horror movie usually consists of intense moments, frightful surprises and some sort of antagonist, however in this movie, the closest thing was some hallucinogenic sequence of a poorly acted rape. I think Bring It On had more horror merit than this movie, for at least Bring It On had some sort of dignified conflict.<br/><br/>The overall lack of integrity in the movie made it a very rough two hours to sit through, and for what? Rosemary didn't even spill her tea on the baby.

","Rosemary's Baby (1968) is one of the most famous horror films ever made. It got excellent unanimously positive reviews when it was released. It received those excellent reviews because it really is a great well done horror film that will creep the hell out of you. The cast includes: Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Charles Grodin, and Ruth Gordon. The performances are marvelous all around, especially by Farrow (Rosemary). Farrow plays the lead role wonderfully. Rosemary goes through a lot in the film and Farrow plays it all so well. Her character starts out as a normal wife. Her and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move into a new apartment and there are many creepy, eerie neighbors around them. They befriend one couple in their 70s and they form a relationship. Rosemary becomes pregnant soon after, but as the pregnancy progresses, complications come up and Rosemary begins to realize that something is deeply wrong and that the people around her might be in on it. She comes to believe that her neighbors are Satan worshipers and that her husband Guy has promised them their baby to use in rituals. It's not until the end that the truth about everything is revealed. This movie uses real effective scare tactics instead of relying on blood and gore like other horror movies. The direction is wonderfully done, the writing is very smart and well written, the performances are spot on from the entire cast, and the ending is one of the most chilling and effective ending I've ever seen! I 100% recommend this classic if you like chilling scary movies. 9/10!"

"FloatingOpera7","10","4","7","15 March 2005"," The Scariest Movie Ever Made, If You're Catholic/Christian
","It was 1968. Director Roman Polanski made his American debut in cinema with this film which would turn out to be his best and the most frightening horror movie ever made. For Polanski, cynicism and a bleak world view became a trademark. He had lost his parents in the horrors of World War II concentration camps. His wife Sharon Tate, pregnant in the summer of 1969 (exactly a year after this movie's release) was brutally killed by the crazed Charles Manson cult. Prior to Rosemary's Baby, Polanski had tackled horror films with ""Repulsion"" starring Catherine Deneuve and the slightly more comedic ""Fearless Vampire Killers"". So what makes Rosemary's Baby so frightening ? If you're a Christian/Catholic the credibility of this film is extremely disturbing, even blasphemous. The theme of the film is that evil wins over good, that Satan triumphs with the birth of his Son, and that God is dead. ""Is God Dead ?"" reads a headline in Time Magazine which Rosemary picks up while waiting at the doctor's office. In the late 60's, with the Vietnam war beginning to rage, and with the outbreak of violence and racial riots of the Civil Rights Movement and trouble at home and abroad, (at home women were rebelling and becoming independent, the pill was out, abortion was rampant) this film seems to be a symbolic/horror manifestation of the time period. Nowadays, it seems tame, and sure enough horror films influenced by this one would emerge in the 70's- The Exorcist and The Omen Series.<br/><br/>This film put Mia Farrow on the map. As Rosemary, the heroine in Ira Levin's novel, she is vulnerable, headstrong and ultimately tragic. It is her maternal instincts that win out in the end. Rather than killing Satan's baby, she opts to ""mother"" it and let it live. This is in an ironic twist a way of saying women should always be the ""mother"" even in the worst case scenario. Remember Rosemary believes, even at the end, that her child is not that bad, that it has a human side and that it could be ""saved"". She rebels against her husband, cuts her hair very short, and wants to get her own doctor. Rosemary represents the modern woman of the late 60's, looking hopeful toward the future. The past, with its mystery, evil ignorance and darkness, is represented by the ambiguous characters of the next door neighbors Roman and Minnie (Ruth Gordon). Are they well-meaning neighbors or are they really Satanic worshipers ? So many nightmarish, surreal elements make us believe it's all some kind of drug-induced hallucination. Rosemary's dream, in which she is aboard a ship with the Presidential couple J.F.K. and Jackie, where a monstrous Devil appears to rape and impregnate her, is so frightening, so confusing, we don't know what's what. What exactly happened to Rosemary ? We could analyze the film for hours. The idea that this could be real is what makes this film, which is otherwise slow-paced, mannered, so frightening. Its horror lies in its psychology and philosophy. John Cassevetes is doing a terrific job as the selfish, materialistic and greedy actor who makes a deal with the Devil. Poor Rosemary. We believe her. We know she is trapped in the evil cult. It is the despair, the futility of escape that makes us most frightened and uneasy. For Polanski, this movie was his emergence into mainstream, American cinema, while at the same time an expression of his own torment."
"Noirdame79","9","4","7","30 November 2004"," We All Pray For Rosemary's Baby
","A blockbuster of a movie that still holds tremendous power today, ROSEMARY'S BABY is, along with THE EXORCIST, one of the most compelling and memorable horror films in movie history. Roman Polanski's subtle direction and the naturalistic performances are enough alone to recommend this scary ride.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a young, naive woman (Mia Farrow, in her signature and best early performance) and her ambitious, struggling actor husband (the late John Cassevettes, ruthlessly brilliant) who rent an apartment in a Victorian building in good old New York, New York. It begins on a somewhat light note, but if you go back and look at it again, you will notice small hints that Polanski dropped. Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse become friendly with seemingly well-meaning but nosy elderly neighbors(the priceless Ruth Gordon and the courtly Sidney Blackmer). Rosemary has a violent nightmare in which she is ravished by a horned creature, on the same night (gasp) she and Guy planned to start trying to conceive a baby (coincidence? I think not). Her pregnancy does not seem to be progressing normally, and her close friends become concerned. Around this time, her husband seems to be getting his big break, and increasingly becomes less sensitive to her feelings and needs. Anyone who appears to be really worried about her or who is in Guy's way of success, becomes beset by mysterious ailments and injuries, even death. She does some detective work and learns more about her strange neighbors and her husband than she cares to know. As she attempts to escape, hoping to deliver and protect her baby, it is apparent that she can't trust anyone, not even the ""dream boy"" doctor. She learns a horrible, incomprehensible truth: she is to bear Satan's child!!!!!!<br/><br/>Producer Robert Evans called this picture, ""a horror movie that has no horror in it, and it still scares the hell out of you."" Truer words were never spoken. The performances are all right on target. But several unnerving and disturbing coincidences and events have made viewing the film somewhat uneasy. The now infamous Dakota apartment building (referred to as ""The Black Bramford"" in the film), is where former Beatle and musician John Lennon was gunned down and killed by a deranged fan. Anton Le Vey, the High Priest Of The Church Of Satan, was reputed to have played Old Scratch in the famous dream sequence, when in actuality it is Cassevettes' face the viewer sees in the close-up shot. It still is extremely creepy, as one of Le Vey's congregation members was Susan Atkins, who assisted murdering Polanski's pregnant wife, the beautiful actress Sharon Tate, in 1969 (she supposedly can be spotted briefly during a party scene in Rosemary's apartment, but I have yet to have catch a glimpse of her). The phone voice of Donald Bomgart, the actor who went blind after winning a role that Guy had auditioned for, was Tony Curtis, who worked with Sharon Tate in the 1967 film ""Don't Make Waves"" and who was a client of Hollywood hairstylist Jay Sebring, who was also murdered that night in 1969.<br/><br/>The DVD release has only improved the movie, and the featurettes are very revealing. It's also a treat to see so many veteran Hollywood actors (Gordon, Ralph Bellamy,Maurice Evans, Elisha Cooke Jr., Patsy Kelly, Phillip Leeds and Hope Summer) in such great roles. Charles Grodin is excellent in an early role as the cold Dr. Hill. As a Catholic, this movie struck a very responsive chord in me. Without a doubt, one of Polanski's best! Don't pass it up, but don't forget to pray for Rosemary's little Andy or Jenny!"
"Ryan_PA_DVD-Head","5","7","15","21 February 2005"," Too slow
","I have to join the legion of folks that thought this movie was quite longer than I would have made it. Hitchcock kept Psycho down to 1hr. and 45min. and that is one thing I wish Polansky did here. Recently I've seen The Pianist and thought it was really good but, despite the good direction and camera work the plot to Rosemary's Baby doesn't quite stand up to the 2hr. and 15min. mark. I must admit that within the last hour somewhere I do get sucked into the movie and enjoy it quite a bit but, if this movie had a half hour cut out of it the film would excite many more people and be more deserving of the horror genre. If you want a thrilling or horrifying classic movie stick with Hitchcock's Psycho, Vertigo, etc. or some of Kubrick's works, Halloween, and some Stephen King adaptations. Mr. Polanski, if you want to create a good horror movie either you or your editor needs to weed out unimportant pieces of information so the story will play out in a more suitable time frame. This should not be considered one of the top 20 horror movies on IMDb and should have been told in less time and that is why I give 5/10."
"hailstreak","2","13","33","5 February 2007"," Overrated and Disappointing Horror. Definitely not a ""Classic.""
","I appreciate horror films that horrify by means of atmosphere and mood instead of blood and gore. Rosemary's Baby has the atmosphere...just not the horror. The atmosphere in this movie is undeniably well-crafted. The acting is great. The characters are well-developed. Rosemary is portrayed as a vulnerable woman in a patriarchal society. Everything seems to be in place for a tremendous horror movie. However, all this film does is set the scene. It delivers nothing in the way of horror, thrills, chills, or anything of the sort. And no, this is not because of the lack of blood and gore.<br/><br/>This movie proceeds at a tortuously slow pace and the suspense is non-existent. I realize that Polanski intentionally creates a ""normal"" environment in this film in order to introduce horror in subtle and psychological ways. But no horror is ever introduced. I kept watching the time tick on my DVD player wondering when something--anything--would happen to catch my attention. After sitting through two hours of this film, I had to reference the DVD case to verify that the film was indeed just 136 minutes long. I couldn't believe that it was almost over and I had not yet seen anything worthwhile. I never did.<br/><br/>The ending was the same as the rest of the film--boring, uneventful, and not even slightly horrifying. Some horror/thriller films escalate the suspense only to disappoint with a weak ending. In Rosemary's Baby, the suspense was never built. My disappointment only comes as a result of high expectations before watching this movie. Overall, a huge disappointment."

","Oh yes, horror thrillers do not come much classier than this. 1968 and yet impressively still feels fresh when watching it for the first time today. It's one of those classic films that I think every film buff or cinephile or average movie fan should watch and I'm sure it's a popular choice when studying the medium of film. The story revolves around a young woman called Rosemary who moves into a new apartment with her husband. She wishes to conceive a baby, but when her obsessive neighbours become involved things start to take a turn into the realm of surrealism. A prime example of this, would be her ""dream"". She dreamt that she was being raped by Satan and that her neighbours and husband were watching as if it was a ritual. But of course we all know what actually happened (I shan't spoil it). It's a plot of mystery and intrigue. Roman Polanski's intelligent direction and screenplay was quite unique. We all knew what happened to Rosemary and we all knew what the end result was going to be, but we as the audience were interested in how Rosemary unravels the plot herself. This could've been a mystery with several twists and turns, but it's more than that. This was all focussed on her. Mia Farrow was excellent and easily held her own against the rest of the supporting cast. She exhumed innocence, fragility and transformed herself. I was impressed. Ruth Gordon won the Best Supporting actress award, I thought she was good but nothing outstanding. Although, she got that New York accent down to a tee! loved how we never saw what Rosemary's baby looked like, the imagery that is conjured up relies on the audience's imagination and I found that to be powerful. There were a few plot conveniences and I found the pacing to be inconsistent. A scene that oozed intrigue was then followed by a slower scene that seemed to negate everything that was before it. However, this is a solid classic horror film that, I'm sure, will never be forgotten."

","Rosemary's Baby is easily one of the best horror movies ever made. There is no blood, gore, or modern violence. But it works on multiple psychological levels that modern horror movies can't seem to touch. Does Rosemary hallucinate? Does she confuse her dreams with reality? Do people want to hurt her baby? Superb acting all around, and all the actors steal the scenes in their own ways. People of strong Christian faith will probably find the last few minutes to be shocking, but what shocked me the most is what Rosemary decides at the very end."

","'Rosemary's Baby' is perhaps the most popular and well known Roman Polanski film after 'Chinatown'. The film is based on a novel of the same name by Ira Levin and it's the 2nd film in Polanski's 'Apartment Trilogy'. The film is about a married couple - Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse who move into the Bramford, a Manhattan apartment. They get introduced to a nosy and odd neighbouring couple - The Castevets who start intruding in their lives a lot. Finally when Rosemary gets pregnant, she starts becoming more and more suspicious about the neighbours as well as her husband.<br/><br/>Polanski had already made 'Repulsion' in 1965 which was the 1st film in his 'Apartment Trilogy' and his 1st film in the English language. But 'Rosemary's Baby' was his first big-budget film and this was also the 1st big-budget Hollywood horror film. But like a true product of its time, it still had the audacity to have ambiguity as one of its qualities unlike the big-budget Hollywood studio productions of the current era. Like 'Repulsion', this film can also be interpreted in many different ways.<br/><br/>The first way to interpret it will be to view it as a work on female liberation. This was made in the 60s when the feminist movement was finally starting to have some impact. One can view the film and opine that Polanski is showing how a woman is being dominated by others and others' opinions are being forced upon her during her pregnancy when all the decisions should rest with her. She starts becoming more and more distant from her husband due to the fact even he fails to understand her mindset and starts dominating her.<br/><br/>The second way to interpret the film will be to take everything literally. The viewer can decide to not go too much into subtexts and themes and take the film for what it is and get immersed in this interesting story of a woman and her pregnancy. <br/><br/>The third way to interpret the film will be to view it as an allegory on how women can seem excessively paranoid and whimsical during pregnancy from a male point of view.<br/><br/>The fourth way to interpret it will be to view the film as the struggle of a woman with a Catholic background to adjust herself to the new and changing society of the 1960s, a decade during which non-conformism and counterculture became a craze. Her paranoia gets the better of her and she begins to fear the prospect of bringing a new child to a world and a society which is straying away from her beliefs and so she tries to distance herself and her unborn baby from all folks that she suspects to have 'questionable' beliefs and faiths.<br/><br/>The beauty of the screenplay written by Polanski himself, is that it facilitates all the interpretations that can be possible. The screenplay is open and provides hints and scopes for viewers to take the film and accept in their own way. I especially loved the ending of the film as I think it is a beautiful tribute to mothers and motherly love.<br/><br/>Another very important aspect of the film is the style of storytelling. Polanski uses surrealism with some dream sequences that are truly weird and effective. Just like 'Repulsion', Polanski blurs the distinctions between what is real and what is being imagined by using a paranoid and sort of unreliable narrator as the whole film is from the point of view of Rosemary who is in pretty much every scene.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow is absolutely brilliant as the titular Rosemary. She looks incredibly gaunt and petite in the film to underline her fragility. She beautifully pulls off the transition from being sweet and gullible to being flat out paranoid. I also loved Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castevet. She richly deserved the Oscar that she won for this role. She is dynamite in every scene she is in. She puts in a method performance so brilliantly that the viewer is always guessing whether to believe her or not.<br/><br/>'Rosemary's Baby' is a very influential horror film. It uses psychological horror to explore deeper themes without resorting to cheap scares, but it still is pretty disturbing. This film is an absolute masterpiece which I can't recommend highly enough."
"scottsommer4321","10","3","5","7 March 2012"," A brilliant film from a talented director
","Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a truly gripping tale into that does everything a classic horror movie should do. Forgoing excessive blood and cheesy monster costumes, the film builds up slowly and subtly to the point where any film-goer would be filled to the brim with tension and fear for what is next to come. After multiple viewings, little subtleties become absurdly visible, such as the recurring color of red or the blatant ignorance of Rosemary as she is manipulated by the wills of all those around her. All in all, this is a genuinely horrifying masterpiece that should not be missed (with an exception for the faint of heart)."

","When I started to watch Rosemary's Baby, I thought it was an ordinary baby story. But it was not like that. As soon as you begin to watch, you feel that some mystic things will happen. Rosemary and Guy moved a new apartment where some bad things had happened. They wanted to have a baby.<br/><br/>And also they had a strange neighbors. Two people both of them are old. Rosemary had a good relationship with them. But after a while Rosemary learned that she had a baby. She had a good doctor. But their strange neighbor suggest them a new doctor. Guy relied on them so he accepted this suggestion. After these things, Rosemary started to have strange dreams. Everything begins with these dreams that she was confused about that. In the end she had a strange baby who was called Satan by her neighbor and also her husband. It was a group that disobey and ignore the God. She wanted to save her baby from these bad people she understood their intention but it was too late. They had already captured her baby.<br/><br/>Actually, the movie includes something mystic and horror. You feel terrible in some spot. I was affected by Rosemary's physical appearance and also her psychology. At some point you feel pity about her due to the fact that she did not look well. And another thing that was affected me is that when rosemary gave birth they put it in a black cradle. Whatever happened, she was a mother. When she saw it in a cradle she was sorry, she shake its cradle even if it was not a normal baby.<br/><br/>Last but not least, nobody believed her and only one person believed her.Truth was much horrific. If you like these kind of movies I mean sometimes you feel horrifying, mercy, sorry, mystic, it would be a good choice. I like its team and cast. They are good at their jobs. I give 7 out of ten.

"jsessa-1","7","3","5","31 July 2005"," Different idea about the film
","Actually, after thinking about this movie a bit more, I tend to think that this subject has absolutely nothing to do with Satan or devil worshipers. Repeatedly we are remind that Rosemary's due date is June 28 This date so coincides with the beginning of the First World War that I often wonder if that was what the author of the book had in mind. If there was one day in human history that marked a sudden and irreversible change, I would have to pick June 28, 1914<br/><br/>Suddenly the world powers of the day begin to arm and arm heavily as they prepared to do battle. This marked the up swing in war technologies on an unimaginable scale. Airplanes were introduced, machine-guns, armored vehicles, giant battle ships and of course chemical warfare. Trench warfare and ""no man's land"", we are reminded through Hollywood and even my own grandfather, was indeed hell on earth. Soon after royal governments ceased to exist as a new idea was born. The Tsar was disposed soon after as well as the Kaiser at the end of the war. This would not be the end of weapon research nor global atrocities on civilian populations. In less than 20 years a new idea blossomed as Fascism took hold of Italy, Germany and Japan. The end results of the Second World War need not be discussed here.<br/><br/>So that is my slant on an otherwise interesting thought provoking film."
"Cheetah-6","10","3","5","27 March 2004"," Classic, Masterful, Horror
","In an age of over the top visual and sound effects it's a real treat to look back on this one for an example of a horror flick built around great story telling, excellent direction and attention to detail, where implied horror is much more powerful than anything that could be shown on the screen.  An expecting mother is one of the most vulnerable states of the human condition already filled with worries, doubts and insecurities and this film plays on that to the hilt.  The dream, drugged scenes leading up to the encounter with Satan himself are an excellent depiction of the subconscious mind and this movie itself has a way of slowly seeping into the subconscious and getting under the skin. This one uses the technique of beginning in the most common and pleasant of situations and then slowly descending into a paranoid nightmare as well as it has ever been done. John Cassavetes  does one of the best husbands as jerk roles that you'll see. Everyone in the film is excellent in their roles, Ruth Gordon almost steals the show and Mia Farrow's delivery is perfect at conveying her emotional state with the inflections of her voice in the delivery of every line. This is a must see film and well worth a revisit if it's been some time since you've seen it. One of Polanski's very best with a nod of course to the obvious Hitchcock influence."
"famsmith","10","3","5","9 December 2000"," Roman Polanski directs one of the greatest, if not the greatest suspense/thrillers of all time!
","Sometimes a film comes along that redeems the art form that is cinema. Rosemary's Baby is one of those films.  In Rosemary's Baby the cinematic content is the priority, the auteur understands what is important is not the story as it is seen on paper, but the story as it is told visually. Polanski proves in this film that when he is on top there is none greater. Polanski takes a remote locale to create in a sense a claustrophobic atmosphere, and understands both cinematography and the audience so well that he uses a barrage of imagery to play the audience like a violin creating a response of pure terror.  However, the amazing thing about this film is that it does even the little things so well.  For example, this film contains the best dream sequences I've ever seen.  True, Hitchcock created some of the most fascinating and artisitc dream sequences visually, but none of them came nearly as close to creating what the dream state is truly like. Many directors lack a sense of daring, they are so worried about appeasing the audience that they cease to challenge them.  Polanski challenges the audience ten times a frame, he creates outrage by allowing chaos to reign, and displays complete disregard for structure/order as the primary priority. Polanski has always struck me as a balance between a director of the French New Wave style and a student of Hitchcock which supplies him with an amazing combination of freedom and precision.  The performances in this film are outstanding all around.  Polanski to me is one of the few directors who is completely fearless when it comes to taking risks.  I don't believe I've ever seen another director who possesses and expresses such dual qualities so effortlessly.  Polanski feels no obligation to tradition, but simultaneously has an enormous amount of respect for the masters who came before him.  There is also a great balance between the fantastic and the realistic in this film, drawing a very thin line between both, and forcing the audience to question the fantastic realities and the realistic fantasies.  They say that the great artists know the rules, but can get away with breaking them because they realize that it is something far beyond rules that makes their medium what it is, and I can think of few filmmaker's who exemplify this to same extent as Polanski."
"bd74","Null","3","5","8 October 2000"," One of the greatest horror movies
","Whenever I watch this movie, I nearly forget that this is a horror movie. It's because this is such a well-made movie...there is actually a story in this movie and it is told in a captivating way.  Nonetheless, the director, Roman Polanski added just the right amount of suspense and shock to make this a definite horror film.  He did not need to include any gory or intensely graphic scenes in this movie. Yet, the movie is scary enough. This movie stars the great Mia Farrow in an awesome, amazing performance. Angel-faced Mia, turns in a marvelous performance as the tragic heroine, Rosemary.  It was quite a feat for Mia, who was only 22 years old when she made this movie.  She's wonderful as the leading character in this movie, and her transformation in the movie from a doe-eyed beauty to a gaunt waif is startling.  John Cassavetes also does a good job playing Rosemary's ambitious husband who's willing to sell his soul to achieve success.  And, Ruth Gordon is superb as their eccentric, devil-worshipping older neighbor. You can't help but feel for poor Rosemary. She initially believes that those closest to her are people that she can trust.  Little by little, she discovers that all those people are plotting against her, and that she's basically on her own. It's horrible to know that she's surrounded by all of those occult-practicing people, yet she can't really do anything about it...she can only accept it.  One of the best things about this movie is the editing--I really liked the way that certain images were superimposed on some of the scenes.  It was like seeing a collage come to life.  The editing is especially noteworthy during the rape scene.  The rape scene is outstanding, frightening, and spellbinding all at the same time.  It's also worthy to point out that sometimes music can do a lot for a movie.  If a movie is good, the right music can make the movie even better; it can set the appropriate mood for the movie.  That's the case with this movie and it's theme song, ""Lullaby"".  Overall, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a terrific movie. One of the greatest horror movies ever made, and one of Roman Polanski's best movies. **** out of ****."

"baumer","7","7","17","9 July 1999"," A very scary film
","God and Satan make for great subjects for horror films.  The reason for that is because we know so little about either of them.  Sure we have what the Bible says, but that is all just theory.  If the Bible is real, I don't believe that God would truly tell us, one of his creations, how powerful he is and I certainly don't think he would tell us how powerful his arch enemy, Satan, is. So when we see movies about Michael Myers and Jason and Freddy, sometimes the later sequels try to explain their superiority with Satanic possession.  After all, what other reason would there be for these beings to be so evil?  That is what makes Rosemary's Baby so frightening.  The fear of the unknown.  To be possessed by the devil is scary, to be impregnated by the devil is dire.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow is great in this film, Cassavettes is very good as well but it is Gordon that is the epitome of fear.  She hits every note perfectly and her smile gives me the creeps.  And say nothing of Polanski.  This film came out before TCM.  And it really shows his love of the camera because he uses it like it was his best friend here.  His filming of the dream sequence and the rape was as good as any scene filmed before the early 80's.  And this was a true crystal ball into how good Texas Chainsaw was going to be.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is what horror movies are all about.  It has great atmosphere, haunting lighting and a very spooky score.  And on one final side note, I think there is one movie character that comes to mind when I think of what the devil could have looked like as a man.  If you have never seen the film Angel Heart, check it out.  DeNiro's turn as Louise Cypher is priceless and he almost seems like it was him that was the one who was haunting everyone in Rosemary's Baby.<br/><br/>A great film.  Much better than most 90's horror."

"Vartiainen","Null","2","3","27 July 2015"," The horror of childbirth
","One of Roman Polanski's most well-known films and a considered to be a mid-century horror masterpiece. And for a reason. Rosemary's Baby knows exactly how to build horror, tension and how to unsettle and exploit the deepest fears within our collective psyche. Just like The Exorcist five years later, it knows exactly where to strike: our progeny.<br/><br/>The directing and the atmosphere are all thanks to Polanski, but a lot of the film's excellence is due to the chillingly good performance from Mia Farrow, playing the role of Rosemary. She's extremely likable and adorable from the very first scene she's in, making the audience cringe that much harder when the eventual horrible things start happening to her. She also portrays the confused terror of not knowing what's going on with her pregnancy extremely well and exactly like a real person would react. Granted, the way she eventually starts to unravel the mystery is a bit coincidental, but that's the fault of the script, and she does her very best to sell it to you.<br/><br/>What I also like about the film is that it doesn't take itself one hundred percent seriously. There are some lighter touches and the film freely nods when the plot starts to become a bit over the top. Which it does, especially near the end, but the film's honesty saves a lot. Another thing about the film is that like many movies of its time, it's a bit slow. In horror that works better than in most films because the atmosphere has that much more time to build, but it'd still be very easy to cut fifteen to thirty minutes away without affecting much. It doesn't ruin the film, really, but it's something that's different to modern films.<br/><br/>All in all Rosemary's Baby is a strong horror piece that has left a lasting impact on its genre. Definitely worth a watch if you like Polanski's style and/or horror in general."

"IMDBcinephile","7","2","3","28 June 2011"," The Consummate Thriller and Mystery Story
","A movie that was born out of greatness; the distinctive element that makes this movie quite good is that everything is all questioned. It gave me a real feeling of the ""Eyes Wide Shut"" story on how everything was staged, how everything was denoted and how people were discerned in the unfolding of the tale (of course, Kubrick's movie was years after this one).<br/><br/>It stars Mia Farrow as Rosemary, who with her spouse Guy (played by John Cassavetes) are investing in an apartment; unbeknown-st to them, the apartment is adjoined to the most peculiar and mystifying of old people; Ruth Gordon plays Minnie Castevet, a rather benevolent and well meaning person, who is the typical ""all kind and all helpful and attentive"" neighbours, who out of their kindness, give a sort of longing for distance. Her husband is played by Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet. The Castevets are part of a certain group of people; the gut grinding feel to the movie give it a reminiscence of Hammer Movies, with the essence of a Hitchcock Thriller; but all in all, giving a genesis to a new entity of film. <br/><br/>My gripe with the movie is that I felt the focal point was actually different from what I had expected; don't get me wrong I thought what my mind presented was not what it was all up to be. And my other gripe is that, like the character, you get frustrated towards the people. But as soon as the plot is ignited, it really does really blast into it. The relationships are laid out in a cliché way as I have explained; however, with that in mind, it is also very ghoulish and you can feel the vividness from it. For example, the satanic silhouette from Theresa (the girl from the beginning's body) is already a real foreshadowing to the theme of the film. That's the power of it – without the context backing it up – it feels Satanic and this is one of the horror trademarks that doesn't always execute it with subtlety and with enough suspense, into that fierce territory of being as surprised as the lead character (Mia Farrow). The motif of the pendant is powerful, surprising and enough to capture your attention. However, when you peg people in the movie, it can really put your mood into a spiral essentially transmitting the idea that everybody is in on it.<br/><br/>My favourite scene is the dream/reality of Farrow's intoxication as we're exploring the deep darkness of sexual violence, sexual lust, sexual passion or just all things sexual; it scared me and creeps me out much more then things like ""The Exorcist"" (1971) and even ""The Shining"" (1980).<br/><br/>The SFX is the best thing about the movie; the ambulance, screaming and chanting sounds through the use of music is absolutely liberating in that state of uncertainty about what you're watching and what's being described.<br/><br/>The scrolled walls, the landscapes, the god like feel to it, the idea of creating the baby and the conspiracy behind that carriage, not just two, but all or possibly even being submitted to more than just one? Wow. It puts you outside of perceptual and mental ideas, forcing you to psychologically take everything in. Like what babies are used for and whether or not that mythology is true or not.<br/><br/>...Another thing that is quite annoying though, is the typical denial dynamic used in the movie, when you clearly know that they know. Even with the Baby, as if to try and creep you out, when you know it is alive or when that book is being impugned as nothing more than a fairy tale; however predictable that was, the ideas behind it were still giving you a great sense of being detected at every moment and ceased at every act with no escape.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is a solid movie; it adopts some of the older conventions of movies, but what the movie does unique is that it has a grittier darkness then other movies of its contemporaries and it also diminishes all humour, subjecting you to Polanski's vision and the rituals of another force to compel you to keep watching as if what you're concentrating on is destiny which is a very scary notion."

The neighbors are creepy and nightmarish even before we find out why they are being so ""helpful"" to Rosemary and concerned about the baby. By the way, would YOU rent an apartment being offered by Elisha Cook Jr.? The acting is fine throughout, with Ruth Gordon being especially memorable. The ending leaves a thing or two to the imagination and is more effective for it.<br/><br/>One major complaint: a number of unattractive characters appear naked, but Playmate of 1968 Angela Dorian doesn't.

They meet nice but pushy neighbors (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer). Then Rosemary gets pregnant...and her life becomes a nightmare. She thinks the neighbors are witches and want her baby. Is that true or is it her imagination? <br/><br/>Now classic horror film. I first caught this at a revival theatre when I was in college. I thought it was too long and dull with terrible acting. I should mention I had just read the book this was based on. Seeing it again (over 20 years later) my opinion has totally changed. I still think it's too long and Farrow's acting wavers (sometimes she just great, other times she's too mannered) but this time I was fascinated and the ending actually scared me silly! The setting is beautiful--the Dakota is a huge building in NY with very exclusive tenants...but it looks downright terrifying here (I have to credit director Roman Polanski for that). Inside the apartments are huge but spooky. When Rosemary and Guy hear chanting through the walls on their first night or so there it's actually pretty chilling. The scene where Rosemary gets pregnant is pretty hard to watch too. Acting, as I mentioned, wavers. Farrow is really off sometimes and Cassavetes looks miserable (I believe he later said he did it for the money) but Gordon (in her Oscar-winning role) and Blackmer are just great. Also Maurice Evans, Charles Grodin, Elisha Cook and Ralph Bellamey are strong in supporting roles. And listen for the voice of Tony Curtis in one sequence. There's also some funny black humor here--at one point Rosemary is in a doctors office. She picks up a ""Time"" magazine and the cover says, ""Is God Dead""? Scary, well-made horror film. Decidedly NOT for pregnant women. I give it an 8.<br/><br/>""What have you done to him you maniacs?"""

","...and despite a few chips around the edges, remains a notably strong piece of thriller film-making, certainly one of Polanski's best works. I'm not sure I can fairly rank it as a Top-100 film, except within the horror/thriller genre, or even a Top-250 film, as the IMDb voters rate it, but there's no denying that it's one of the most memorable films of the late sixties. The dexterity with which Polanski slowly ratchets up the tension and paranoid unease, the remarkable performances (especially from Mia Farrow as Rosemary, and Ruth Gordon as Rosemary's nemesis, Mrs. Castavet), the unique setting of the Dakota, William Fraker's fine DP work, Krzysztof Komeda's unsettling score; all contribute to an amazing movie-going experience that culminates in the final, shockingly maternal twist ending.<br/><br/>Now, all that to the side, I'm going to venture into dirtied waters here and say that I'd love to see an updated version of ""Rosemary's Baby"" along the lines of ""The Omen"" remake. Audiences are more sophisticated these days, as are acting and storytelling techniques, and from this viewer's perspective, ""Rosemary's Baby"" telegraphs its eventual payoff in more ways than one. Victoria Vetri's Terry, the Castavet's original guinea pig, is introduced and killed off so quickly that the event stands out like a sore thumb. John Cassavettes' performance is, by modern standards, notably unsubtle; he is identifiably a ""bad guy"" almost from the moment he meets the Castavets, if not sooner. His behavior is decidedly sexist and domineering; no modern female worthy of the name would put up with his selfishness and deceptions. I'd love to see someone like Christian Bale or Ed Norton take on the role. Ruth Gordon's intrusive Minnie at times seems utterly transparent in her kvetching insistence on pumping Rosemary full of Satanic potions. Certainly no woman who'd ever read ""Our Bodies, Our Selves"" would give a quack like Dr. Sapperstein more than one visit. And even Rosemary seems anachronistically naive and sheltered from the grim realities of life, though perhaps I've overlooked some back story that explains that. Regardless, I'd love to see one of our recent crop of fine young actresses tackle the role: Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman, Hillary Swank, etc., or even an unknown with the requisite talent.<br/><br/>It's been nearly four decades, and despite all the supernatural spin-offs like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen"" and ""The Seventh Sign"" and so on and so forth, ""Rosemary's Baby"" retains its vaunted position in the pantheon of top-rank chillers. I'd love to see a new version attempt to dethrone it."

And it seems like barely any dialogue or plot points were cut out (it'd be almost impossible to cut out any of the plot because Levin wrote such a tightly plotted and suspenseful book.) Polanski's direction is great, and Mia Farrow made a perfect Rosemary. The final scene is one of my favorites ever, when she's sneaking to the Castavet's apartment to get back her baby with the knife, and all the old satanists are standing around, and she sees the baby's amber eyes, and screams, ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIS EYES?!?"" *shiver*.

","We can see how horror movies were evolving in the late 60s. Even so, this movie was ahead of its time. At the same time, the movie has a slow plot that gradually unfolds throughout very smoothly.<br/><br/>The acting of Mia Farrow was half the movie right there. She is a naive Catholic girl unaware of how she is being betrayed. Nothing like watching a pretty young Catholic girl being taken advantage of. (I'm really not like that in real life. Horror movies are my outlet.) This movie is definitely worth watching for those who love imagination and a somewhat drawn-out story line. It is not for slasher fans and gore hounds, however. Sure, there are a few good sex scenes, but they tie into the intellectual quality of this movie. Not much for gore at all.<br/><br/>The only weakness I see in this film is in the ending. (Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler.) Maybe Polanski bit off more than he could chew. I see what he was going for, but he was holding back I think. It was a little weak. It probably could have used some gore.<br/><br/>I gave it 9 of 10. The ending, though controversial and dark, was somewhat weak and cost it a perfect 10 from me, which I reserve for the very best."

"crash_into_me420","Null","2","3","11 August 2003"," A Thrilling-Yet-Imperfect Achievement for Psychological Horror
","Warning: Spoilers Throughout This is most definitely an extremely creepy film and just about deserves each and every accolade that it has received over the years. I think that the main reason for its effectiveness is the superficially innocent layer that it holds over each horrific event as it unfolds, always suspending the audience's disbelief  there is always the notion that, perhaps, Rosemary is just insane. Characters are presented as ostensibly harmless people as an insidious theme of evil lurking beneath the surface is achieved in such a subtly convincing way that it makes David Lynch's work look amateurish by comparison. <br/><br/>The film also works well on levels of alienation and existentialism  there is even some satire present (Guy's willingness to cross over to the dark side' in exchange for fame/fortune makes for quite a severe shot at the psychological effects of entertainment industry.) But the film's ever-present atmosphere of dreary cynicism eventually crosses over the realm of plausibility and into the absurd. By the end, Polanski's unwavering refusal to provide any shred of hope or optimism toward humanity becomes unnecessarily depressing and ultimately left me feeling quite empty.<br/><br/>
We're left with a cold statement basically telling us that evil is simply inviolable and will ultimately consume even the most innocent of people, in favor of an annoyingly overwrought depiction of motherly love, and in doing so Polanski appears to unintentionally glorify Satanism as well. I'm not suggesting that there should have been bloodshed to resolve anything, but perhaps this whole thing would've worked out better had Rosemary been depicted as rejecting Catholicism rather than simply ignoring it. There also happens to be a gaping plot hole in this resolution  why would Rosemary show affection for the devil child if she already knows that it's going to be sacrificed by flesh and blood' anyway  as revealed earlier in the film?<br/><br/>
With all of these complaints aside, I still consider Rosemary's Baby' to be one of the finest psychological horror films that I've ever seen. Polanski manages to provide us with subtle hints that never really provide clear-cut answers but allow us to think back and piece everything together quite neatly in the end."
"bregund","Null","2","3","27 February 2003"," One of the scariest films ever
","There are spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby sits on the cusp of changing Hollywood filmmaking; abandoning the corny westerns and drawing-room banter of 1950s films that basically mimic stage performances, it explodes into the 1960s like some crazy psychedelic dream.  The Miracle Worker, The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke:  the 1960s were a movie renaissance for the American public.  It must have been a very exciting time if you were a moviegoer, and Rosemary's Baby belongs in the same vein of exciting films.<br/><br/>Where do I begin?  The fundamental strength of this film is its believability, and it accomplishes it with flow.  This film effortlessly captures the natural flow between man and wife, in a way that no film prior to it ever did.  Cassavettes's smoldering expression and smoky observations as Guy play so easily against Farrow's waifish, wide-eyed Rosemary that it's easy to imagine they might have been married in real life.  It is so easy to see these people as real characters, because we are given their strengths and faults, we see them quarrelling and kissing, just like real life.  It is this strength of reality that pulls along the rest of the film; when things turn unreal, that's when the real terror begins.  Polanski brilliantly takes this sense of unreality to the limit.<br/><br/>Polanski's genius lies in taking Hollywood cliches and putting a contemporary spin on them:  witches no longer wear long black clothes and pointy hats, they are an annoying old woman and a pie-faced old man living in a run-down gothic apartment building in New York.  The creepy Dakota apartment building is the iconic haunted house of everyone's collective subconscious, brought into contemporary 1960s city living.  The building is at first serene but becomes more sinister as the film progresses.  Guy and Rosemary renovate their new flat, brightening it with gallons of white paint and pre-Martha Stewart white linens, but like MS herself, there is something odd lingering underneath the surface.<br/><br/>Ruth Gordon steals the movie.  She nails the part of Minnie Castevet with such self-assured manic demeanor that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role.  She gleefully destroys the cliche of the Halloween-style Margaret Hamilton witch, and instead gives us a witch who looks like a train wreck.  Dressed like a clown with too much makeup, forcing her nutrition drinks down Rosemary's throat, barging into Rosemary's apartment, displaying terrible table manners, and doing her best to meddle in every detail of Rosemary's life, she is at once annoying and fascinating; who would ever think a witch could actually be irritating?<br/><br/>By the end of the film, Cassavettes's ambitious actor Guy Woodhouse is a pathetic, soulless automaton, clearly the film's villain for selling his wife's body to the witches in order to advance his career.  His deception is laid bare for all the world to see, and made all the more abject with his inability to see anything wrong with the unholy agreement.  I wonder how many other actors would do the same thing.<br/><br/>There is more fear in the unknown than in the known; special effects can only do so much to capture the fear that we all share, but Rosemary's Baby, much like the Exorcist and the Blair Witch Project, uses huge doses of suggestion rather than relying solely on special effects.  The truly frightening things are left to the imagination, for instance when Rosemary looks at the baby and shrieks `What have you done to his eyes?', we don't need to see them, we know they're frightening because of her reaction. <br/><br/>
After watching this film, it's easy to see where The Exorcist gained most of its inspiration, although Rosemary's European director gives us an ending that is perfectly chilling and uncompromisingly pessimistic, while the Exorcist continues as though nothing ever happened.  <br/><br/>This is a must-see film."

Well, that's a predicament that Rosemary Woodhouse has to face at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>
Rosemary's Baby is a true classic of the horror/chiller genre, I think it's a film that's going to appeal more to women or men with children, because it taps into the fears and anxieties of childbirth. The ending of the film is a metaphor, because Adrian is the son of the Devil, it becomes a play on deformity, and Rosemary has to come to the conclusion weather or not she can still love him unconditionally.<br/><br/>This is timeless stuff here, and people who say it isn't scary obviously should go and rent a cheap slasher movie or something along the lines of Friday the 13th, this is chilling psychological horror at it's most subtle. Polanski's direction goes in for that sixties feel, lots of colour and no-nonsense angles, it does make the film seem a little dated, but it also gives a very creepy atmosphere to the apartment (a la Repulsion).<br/><br/>The performances are also good, the main standouts being Farrow as the innocent Rosemary, and Cassavetes is good as the scheming Guy, but all acting plaudits would go to the excellent Ruth Gordon (remember her from Harold & Maude) as the Woodhouse's nosey neighbour. This is serious and intelligent horror from one of cinemas sadly forgotten directors that I would recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>9/10"

Being a caring community everyone in the apartment block makes sure she's getting the best natural diet , I mean Rosemary is pregnant and these people can't do enough for her . What lovely people but this makes the movie a rather sugary affair as the neighbours goodness becomes rather suffocating . Only the dimmist audience member won't be pointing out to themselves that these neighbours must have a totally ulterior purpose in making sure Rosemary is getting the best care possible ....<br/><br/>**** SPOILERS *****<br/><br/>... And indeed they do have an ulterior purpose as it turns out that Rosemary is giving birth to young Master Satan . I don't mean that metaphorically , I mean that literally ! and the whole idea is bloody stupid when you think about it . All these Satanists living in the same block . Good job they're all the same age and have the same social standing to be able to live in the same block as does thespian David . Yeah I know this is all a conspiracy but does it seem credible ? Like many of these type of movies if you don't believe in the physical embodiment of the Devil ( Or indeed Jesus ) then it's impossible to believe that Satan would get a mortal woman pregnant <br/><br/>Another problem I had is that the audience are left in little doubt that this is a truly supernatural tale . Wouldn't it have been a far better movie if Polanski had made everything ambiguous ? By that I mean having the audience think that Rosemary is deluded then pull the rug out under their feet but while I was watching there's little doubt in my mind that Rosemary is the protagonist in a Hellish conspiracy <br/><br/>I will praise the story for making the point that just because someone is in league with the devil this doesn't necessarily make them a bad person , after all how many people commit atrocities against mankind in the name of the horned beast ( God is a different matter entirely ) but for the most part ROSEMARY'S BABY is a very slow film with an incredibly stupid ending"

The ending is so good, the reveal that her son is a demon is everything and more; everyone yelling ""hail satan"" is too funny.
The chase sequence was so intense and suspenseful. When Rosemary locks the door and goes to use the phone and two gentleman walk pass the doorway, I felt so helpless for her. The fact that her husband, doctor, and everyone around her has been gas lighting her felt so horrifying.
Overall, I really enjoyed the film and I really thought that I wouldn't have. The music was good and the character development was very good.

","So I haven't seen this film until recently. I finally watched it because the film was referenced in Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"".

I find it incredibly ironic and sad that Polanski makes this film surrounding a pregnant woman and then not long after his then pregnant wife Sharon Tate is brutally murdered. How crazy is that?<br/><br/>However, going back to the film, it's of course fantastic but I wasn't surprised that it was. The film has been described to me as nothing short of a psychological horror masterpiece, which is my favorite genre type. This movie has so many layers, as soon as I watched it I sought out a video explaining all of its themes and symbolism. Some of the themes in which I gathered were that of of course the occult and satanism. But also feminism/women's liberation, paranoia and mental health. That's a huge amount of plot in one film and it somehow maintains its pacing and composure. It's actually really incredible! This could be because a lot of it is very subtle and not so in your face obvious.<br/><br/>I feel like I'm going to have to rewatch this film to get all of what it has to offer. Obviously I can still fully appreciate it for what it is though. This film is also stylistically very fascinating to look at. Accompanied with a fantastically creepy and unsettling soundtrack, you have an incredibly powerful movie. We also have an Oscar worthy performance from Mia Farrow (who honestly I thought was Twiggy at first lol) and a frustratingly fantastic performance by John Cassavetes whom I wanted to punch in the face so badly in this film.<br/><br/>Please see this movie if you haven't. You'll be incredibly unsettled and be warned there is a very explicit sexual assault scene.

"jayjaycee","9","1","1","20 October 2019"," The Terror of Subtlety
","""Rosemary's Baby"" is a 1968 horror drama directed by Roman Polanski starring Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes. Since I was young my Dad taught me that Polanski's movies have a specific individuality to them and that he has always been way ahead of his time. I always agreed and I personally don't care about the controversies about him as a person, I've always admired him as an artist and excellent director. Besides all tragedies and scandals he never failed to make outstanding motion pictures and, as expected, this drama is no exception. First of all, this film is a text book example of a slow burner. It takes all the time it needs to build up an eclectic mystery. Unlike other horror films from this era, this one doesn't rely on jump scares and effects, in fact the main theme of the whole film is subtlety. Just as the score magnificently underlines, the horror takes place in the hidden details and, most importantly, in your own head. It obviously messes around with the viewer's own judgement and, thanks to an outstanding adapted screenplay by Polanski, manages to fool you multiple times and leads you astray in a way you can't even imagine. I sat there and couldn't decide what to believe in, as it offers clues for every possible theory. The film gets more sinister from minute to minute and this effect is also supported by the superb performance of Mia Farrow. Also mentionable is the unique camera work that splendidly captures the subliminal threat. The whole suspense builds up to the final scene where it is unleashed with an indescribably severe vehemence that hits you right in the face. The shock in Rosemary's face is the peak of it. While the shock was more or less absent throughout the course of the run time this scene brilliantly compensates for it. All in all, this film scores with the sheer brilliance of Roman Polanski's directorial style, magnificent performances and near perfect storytelling pace. It's not the average horror film and that's what makes it so legendary and that's why it will always be an iconic entry to the genre."

here is the best review I red on imdb: A quiet, erudite chiller, but not conventionally frightening
magic_marker8 June 2002
If there are omens in this world, they were not heeded by the makers of Rosemary's Baby. The director would soon see his own pregnant wife disemboweled by the Manson family, the actor hired to play Satan would be revealed as a serial rapist, the leading lady would see her husband engage in an affair with someone who was effectively their daughter, and the building around which the film was shot would 12 years later bear witness to the tragic death of John Lennon.<br/><br/>This was without a doubt a cursed film, and its sado-sexual undercurrents are ultimately made more powerful by knowledge of the evils, perversions, and obsessions woven into the myth of its making.<br/><br/>However, do not expect to be overtly frightened by this film. Unlike more recent ""traditional"" horror films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Others,"" this film will not make you jump. It is instead a slightly comic, often disturbing psychological portrait of one innocent woman's breakdown as she comes into contact with the carnal and callous power of Satanism. Mia Farrow plays this breakdown perfectly. Her performance (easily the best she has ever given) is potently tremulous, and effectively walks the fine line between hysteria and conviction. The Satanists, into whose complete power she is delivered by her husband, possess a wonderfully concealed menace, particulaly the obstetrician, a smiling, cold-eyed fascist.<br/><br/>The once infamous scenes, such as Rosemary eating raw liver, lack the shock value they once had, and are filmed in such a documentary style that whatever horror they could have conveyed is lost on modern audiences. Whatever power the film has is entirely invested in Rosemary's descent into madness, and that is still as powerful as ever"

","One of those movies I have watched before but can honestly say I wasn't that struck on the first or even second time around. However on a winter's night when looking for something to watch I decided on Rosemary's baby again. I watched it twice over two nights and absolutely loved it.The haunting lullaby at the beginning is a great intro into this brilliant psychological horror movie and the setting of the gothic building in which the young couple begin what is supposed to a normal and happy life also sets the tone for the next couple of hours. Some great acting and directing are both on show here in what is really a thinking man/woman's horror movie. I found the rape scene to be both atmospheric and very disturbing at the same time and the moment when Mia Farrow realises she isn't actually dreaming is very chilling indeed. This is most definitely a horror classic and far more scary than some of the absurd movies being made nowadays that rely so heavily on blood and gore and are actually far less frightening than this brilliant movie. Although Mia Farrow is brilliant I loved the part her husband plays as you can see ever so slightly how he becomes more and more under the influence of his sinister neighbours and there ulterior motive yet still remsins undetected by his koving wife. Nothing will stand in the way of the devil's work and one can't help but feel so sorry for the lovely Hutch yet another casualty of a higher power !"

Story is obviously the main element here, and it's that, along with the acting & atmosphere, that keeps you watching.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting...there are some moments where it's a bit dodgy or over-the-top, but this film was made in '68 so some of the performances will seem a touch melodramatic by today's standards. In saying that, however, I do think Mia Farrow gives a great performance as the sweet & innocent, yet somewhat naive, Rosemary.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, I think the scare factor hype has been amped way up and I always scratch my head in wonderment when people say they found it extremely scary/creepy as I personally never found it to be either of those. I guess it proves that different people find different things scary. I mean I know of people who have said The Exorcist isn't creepy/scary yet for me that film completely pacifies Rosemary's Baby. I wasn't expecting a ""boo!"" or gory film, and a film doesn't have to have those elements to be scary for me, but while it was disappointing on that side, other aspects held my interest enough for me to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it, especially if you enjoy films that cater more towards the psychological element."

","I've always been a horror movie fan. I enjoy horror movies for their imaginative takes on the darker aspects of reality, the sh*t that everyone knows but never talks about like places where tragic events have happened inviting bad spirits, death, etc. I enjoy them, but they usually don't scare me.<br/><br/>See, the creepy feeling that I could be possessed, like in Exorcist, is a fear that typically doesn't live outside of dreams and late-night contemplation. Getting killed by Freddy, ditto. Getting murdered by a stranger, like Jason Voorhees, is about as likely as getting hit by lightning, as long as I stay out of the wrong neighborhoods. <br/><br/>But this movie... This is a different kind of fear, one that isn't fun. It's not that there's a secret coven of devil-worshipers victimizing people and doing terrible things. It's that the movie is so incredibly well-directed that it convinces me that such things really ARE abroad in the world, and could be anywhere. And why not? There's not a lot here that's implausible. <br/><br/>That's the problem with this movie, it's brilliant but it leaves me feeling paranoid."

","""Hierarchy is often a way to do as efficiently as possible what ought not to be done at all; a machine for compelling people to do what they have no direct rational interest in doing, for the benefit of those with whom they have a fundamental conflict of interest."" - Ursula Le Guin <br/><br/>Ira Levin specialised in Feminist horror novels. His 1972 novel, ""The Stepford Wives"", for example, featured a housewife whose husband colludes with a cabal of men responsible for creating a fleet of submissive, female robots. Levin's 1967 novel, ""Rosemary's Baby"", does a similar thing. Adapted by director Roman Polanski, it stars Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes as a young couple who move into a Gothic apartment complex (The Dakota, where John Lennon was shot).<br/><br/>From the onset, Farrow's character, Rosemary Woodhouse, is portrayed as a docile American housewife. Meek and waifish, she's a doting stay-at-home woman who's entirely dependent upon her husband. Elsewhere men are portrayed as being controlling, manipulative and aggressive, whilst women are consigned to traditionally feminine realms (cooking, cleaning, jewellery, gardening, knitting etc), infantilized at the hands of a monolithic, male dominated society.<br/><br/>One must remember that the 1960s featured many high profile debates on both abortion and the status of women as legitimate political and legal subjects. Women's movements were gaining momentum and were beginning to repeal abortion laws, fight for the right to self-determination, and seize control of the means of reproduction from a medical profession considered to be elitist and patriarchal. In this regard, Levin's novel took Rosemary and used her as a locus for a very specific culture war. It gathered numerous examples of patriarchal dominance (religion, the medical establishment, marriage etc) and featured them repeatedly vying for control of Rosemary's body. She was then bullied into passivity, subjected to outrageous coercion and eventually pushed into madness and paranoia. Rosemary was herself an agent of her own submission, the poor girl repeatedly rationalising her suffering as being ""all her fault"".<br/><br/>Midway in both film and novel, Rosemary and her husband, the aptly named Guy, resolve to have a baby. But unbeknownst to Rosemary, Guy has made a Faustian pact with a Satanic couple living next door. In return for career advancements, he will turn Rosemary's body over to Satan so that she may be raped and so give birth to the Prince of Darkness. This, of course, is a perverse take on the Bible's Immaculate Conception (also featuring a Mary). The names of the devious neighbours (Roman and Minnie Castevet) themselves conjure up the other two men meta-controlling Rosemary: John Cassavetes and Roman Polanski himself.<br/><br/>With at least 12 films overtly or covertly about rape, no mainstream film director has made more films ""about"" sexual violation than Roman Polanski. Polanski would himself be charged with raping a 13 year old girl in 1977. In real life he seems to also have a sexual predilection for young girls and teenage actresses, though his films often sympathise with the rape victim (not always; at least 3 posit the ""rapist"" as being unjustly bullied and/or victimised).<br/><br/>In ""Rosemary Baby"", of course, Rosemary is raped. There is some ambiguity surrounding this incident – Rosemary is either raped by her husband, given to Roman Castevet himself as a sexual favour or literally raped by Satan – but most readings have the same political subtext. Another reading sees Rosemary's persecutions as being ""imagined"" and ""all in her head"", her anxieties a result of her pregnancy, lapsed Catholicism and various domestic/maternal insecurities. The film supports this view, but accepting it turns the audience into villains, bullies equal to Guy and his neighbours. While horror movies routinely offer misogynistic repudiations of the maternal body, of the ""monsterous feminine"" (""Alien"", ""Jurassic Park"" etc), and while, on the level of biology alone, the foetus is literally a parasite, separate from the mother's body, taking everything and contributing nothing to her sustenance, the film itself seems to be doing something completely else. Rosemary's paranoia is valid precisely because sexist social relations are clearly conspiring against her. Her doctors, various paternalistic authority figures, her husband, her neighbours, a male dominated medical profession...they're all colluding against Rosemary. It's another of Polanski's Kafkaesque conspiracy plots; the world really is out to get you.<br/><br/>Significantly, characters are constantly telling Rosemary not to read books or outright removing books from her possession. Her apartment bookshelf is itself filled with books which Guy strategically keeps out of reach, namely Kinsey's reports, ""Listening with the Third Ear"" and ""Yes I Can"", all books on self-empowerment and self-understanding. The goal is to keep Rosemary dumb, dependent and isolated. And the only scene in which Rosemary is shown to mingle with female friends – boisterous feministas who rally to her defence – is precisely the scene which spurs Guy into revealing his sexism. ""Pain is a warning something isn't right,"" Rosemary says, repeating the mantra of her proto-feminist sisters. But Guy shoots her down: ""don't listen to those bi**es!"" Emancipation remains out of reach.<br/><br/>The film's title has an ironic twang (Rosemary's ""baby"" is not her baby, she didn't consent to its conception, indeed, Rosemary is herself the film's baby). Its aesthetic is Hitchcock meets New Hollywood, whilst the film itself serves as a perverse bridge from Old Hollywood to New, with many familiar faces from the Golden Age cast against type and given significant parts (Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon, Elisha Cook etc). Smoothly directed and misstepping only occasionally with some moments of comedy and overt ""gore"", the film's still influential to this day. Emblematic of the film's impact, Farrow's pixie haircut still pops up in modern horror movies (""Birth"", ""The Astronauts Wife"" etc"").<br/><br/>8.5/10 - Classic."
"charishankar","8","1","1","9 December 2012"," Unnerving viewing, more than 40 years down the line ...
","Times have changed.<br/><br/>In it's time, Rosemary's Baby was regarded as a horror classic. It still is, to an extent. But to tell the truth, more than 40 years after its release, the definition of horror, in cinema, has unquestionably changed greatly, and, in these days, not having, as it does, any over-the-top gore or jump moments, Rosemary's Baby may no longer scare.<br/><br/>In fact, if I found anything really unnerving in the film, it was that expression, on the face of Mia Farrow transcendentally evoking Rosemary, in the final 2 minutes. It made me grateful that the film ended there, without showing what followed thereafter ...<br/><br/>For, as Polanski tells the story, we already know, or at least have guessed, about halfway through the film, all about Rosemary's baby, even when it is still in utero, though Rosemary herself may not. And THAT is where the supreme artistry of the film lies. Horrifying though it may not be any more, it still is chilling, and chilling to the core, as the fate of Rosemary herself always remains entirely unknown, till the very end. And that is also why the ambiguity in Mia Farrow's parting expression remains so disturbing, and stays etched in the memory much after the film itself has ended.<br/><br/>I cannot figure out, for the life of me, why Mia Farrow did not get an Academy Award for her performance. Ruth Gordon did, of course, for playing the perfect foil, as Minnie Castavetes, to Mia's Rosemary. Mia's indecisions, her fear, her abject terror at the threat she perceives to the life of her unborn child, far transcend the limits of the script, and stamp themselves indelibly on the psyche. It is truly a bravura effort, and carries the character to a level where Mia and Rosemary become entirely indistinguishable. To say the least, it can serve as a textbook example for anyone who wants to learn what acting is all about.<br/><br/>Equally inspired - if not, however, equally challenging - are, unquestionably, the performances of Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer as Minnie and Roman Castevet. I particularly liked the sly ambivalence with which Blakmer delineates his character, so starkly in contrast to his wife's menacingly overbearing effervescence.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is undoubtedly far-fetched and difficult to believe or digest, and, in the hands of a less inspired cast, may have been reduced to B-grade phatasmagoria. As it is, however, as conceived and created by Polanski and as executed by Farrow, Gordon and Blackmer, it is nothing short of art on celluloid.<br/><br/>Rewarding and memorably disturbing viewing, more than 40 years after it was made."
"manyak_tazz","8","1","1","8 June 2011"," Rosemary's Baby Film Review
","Rosemary's Baby (1968) Film Review<br/><br/>Rosemary's baby is really amazing, frightening and so beautiful. I think this movie is really burrow deep in one's psyche. One can easily feel all the events in the film. The film has a potential to require me to use a night light.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski made his American directorial debut with this wonderfully sinister film. The first hour feels like a French New Wave movie in the vein of Godard's Breathless. There's definitely a European sensibility to Polanski's direction which is understandable.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes play young newlyweds who move into a Gothic apartment in New York previously inhabited by an old woman who recently died. Down the hall live an strange elderly couple who befriend their young neighbors. They seem like good intentions. One night, Rosemary has a nightmare in which she is raped by the devil himself. Upon waking up, she realizes that her husband was having marital relations with her at the moment she was dreaming.<br/><br/>Soon after she learns of her pregnancy. Her husband has conveniently found success as an actor. Rosemary continually feels sharp pain. Eventually, with the goading of a recently deceased friend of hers, Rosemary begins to distrust everyone around her, including her husband, her neighbors and her doctor. Perhaps she's suffering from pericardium delusions, or maybe there is a palpable evil that's always nearby.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow, who was known to most at the time as Mrs. Frank Sinatra, gives an amazing performance in a really difficult role. She must be likable, yet cold and distant all at once. For much of the film, Rosemary suffers quite a bit while maintaining a cool demeanor. The final scene, especially, is so over the top that I can't even begin to imagine how Farrow was able to find her motivations. The supporting cast, including Gordon who's always fun to watch on screen even if she really can only play one type of character, does fine work, especially cinema verity pioneer director Cassavetes.<br/><br/>There are a handful of moments that are a bit too contrived to work, so the movie isn't quite a masterpiece. The whole sequence with the anagram from the book makes little sense. Further, Rosemary transitions from slightly anxious to appearing downright psychotic perhaps a little too quickly. The aforementioned climactic sequence goes down as one of the wackiest ever while proving profoundly unsettling at the same time. Perhaps it might have been even better if everything at the end wasn't so staged. The New Wave style is abandoned during the final act when the horror takes full effect, which does invite the viewer to disconnect slightly. If even these freakish moments had been played straightforwardly, the film as a whole might have proved even scarier than it ended up.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby isn't just about the ridiculously impossible. It's also a scary metaphor for motherhood. Having never been pregnant myself, I can only begin to imagine the anxieties that go along with bringing another human life to term. It would only be natural to wonder if one's baby is going to be healthy, and what kind of person that baby will grow up to be. Rosemary's horror is shared by all mothers in many different ways. The responsibilities that go along with parenting are enough to make people think twice about having children in the first place. Of course, the decision Rosemary must tackle at the end of the film is beyond any mother's worst fantasies. Still, though, having children can be, among other things, horrifying.<br/><br/>A palpable fear of Satan having tangible power in this world is an irrational one, and yet, as a cinematic theme, it's still as in vogue as it was back in the late 60's and early 70's with films like The Last Exorcism and the upcoming film Priest. Maybe it's the idea of evil itself actually able to reason independently, much like humans, that really gets to people. Rosemary's Baby won't force me to sleep with my light on tonight, but it does make me hope that my dreaming remains at a minimum for quite a while. Also, it might be a good idea for me to take a home pregnancy test, you know, just to be safe."

","Rosemary's Baby is a true genre classic.Undoubtedly, this film is certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made. As a horror fan I thought I was missing out on a lot by not having seen this, and I was right.Expectations were high and this one lived up to them.This movie is an example of the horror genre done right; there are spine-chilling moments, satanic images and horror themes that will stay with you forever. The editing in these parts is very impressive as well, creating visual illusions without special effects. It also contains some of the damned finest performances a horror film has ever seen.Mia Farrow was nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance, and quite rightly so.Farrow's portrayal of the helpless mother desperately seeking to protect her unborn child is powerfully emotional. Ruth Gordon also put in a splendid performance as the creepy character of Minnie.This is a masterpiece of horror. Everyday situations have an undercurrent of evil. These skillfully hid details haunt the viewer. An odd closet, a suicide, her neighbors' extreme interest As the date of birth gets closer, the film grows increasingly claustrophobic. The development of the plot gets interrupted abruptly in the last scenes, when the intrigue is revealed.The story builds a nice conspiracy well and sustains a real creepy atmosphere all the way through to good effect.Farrow is suitable unbalanced and we feel her fear and suspicion growing during the film. Her performance is really good and the fact that she manages to balance her own doubt for most of the film is very effective.The music is also very memorable and creepy.Overall, this is a perfect adaptation of Ira Levin's book, Rosemary's Baby remains today one of the best horror movies, not for its use of gore, but for its use of tension and surprise."

","I watched this movie at the listening and pronunciation lesson. When I watched the beginning of the film I disappointed because the first forty-five minutes or so seem fairly normal and conventional. There isn't any interesting things . The story follows a happily married couple, Rosemary and a struggling actor Guy, looking for a new apartment. They find a very nice and large apartment that fits them perfectly well but has a rather disturbing history (And how many times have we seen that in movies?). Very soon they meet their new elderly neighbors. Minnie and Roman that seem very friendly, may be a bit too friendly. Soon, Rosemary gets pregnant and the couple celebrates this happening with their dear neighbors that are eager to take very good care of Rosemary and help her out as much as they can. They even talk Rosemary into seeing a doctor of their choosing. She starts to have strange dreams and soon she becomes very suspicious of her neighbors and their ""helping"" with the baby. Rosemary and Guy moved a new apartment where some bad things had happened. They wanted to have a baby. Everything begins with rosemary's pregnancy. She becomes alone, helpless, and trapped in her fears .Until the end, we don't know if her suspicions are valid. The main event seems to be the ending. She learns her baby is from Satan. Her husband and neighbors cheated her. In my opinion, this film is different. It isn't quite like any film I have ever seen. It is on the top horror films list but it wasn't scary for me.I think it is a drama instead of a horror.I was affected by Rosemary's physical appearance and also her psychology. At some point you feel pity about her. Even though it finished up with sadness. If one ask me about this movie, I strongly advise it."

","Rosemary's Baby is one of the greatest horror film of that times. It was made 43 years ago, however it is rather fantastic. Rosemary and her husband Guy Woodhouse move to an apartment. They meet their elderly neighbors named Roman and Minnie Castevet who are very friendly to them. Although their friendly behaviors, Rosemary feels something strange about them. On the contrary, her husband begins to be very close to them. Rosemary and her husband wants to have a baby, and the night that they decided to have a baby, Minnie comes and brings them a desert to eat. At first Rosemary hesitates to eat it but her husband insists on her to eat. After eating that, she feels dizzy and she thinks that she sees a nightmare but she really lives it. That part of the film is really thrilling, complex and disturbing to me. While watching the scene, i felt so nervous and disgusted. Rosemary becomes pregnant but something starts going wrong. She begins to lose weight and suffer from terrible pains. She begins to complain about her pains but her husband and neighbors don't care about her discomfort. Nobody attempts to help her, even her friends, and her doctor... When she understands that all of them are witches, she wants to run away but because of her baby, firstly she has to go to her doctor and she tells the doctor that her husband and neighbors are witches and they want to harm her baby. But the doctor give her to them. They take her to home, she try to escape again but she can't escape and gives a birth. At the and of the film, we understand that she gives birth to a satanist baby. And she can do nothing in the face of such a situation. I think this is a disappointing ending. But this is not important because the film is absolutely gripping."
"moviesleuth2","8","1","1","17 February 2008"," Polanski's genius
","His criminal record aside, it is obvious that Roman Polanski is a genius director. His ability to set up shots with a specific tone that grows evenly as the film proceeds is extraordinary. That is what makes this film work.<br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" is a slow burn thriller, one that starts innocently enough, but not exaggerated to the point where it's obvious that the character's lives are about to take a turn for the worse, but ever so gradually the gears start turning and the unsettling feeling starts to build. Polanski is no fool; he doesn't try to create two hours of terror (much like Hollywood does, but can't seem to understand that it has no idea what it's doing), he knows that Levin's story isn't like that. This decision saves the film from obvious doom. Actually, he constructs this film so well, that for a good portion of the film it's hard to believe that this is going to develop into a horror film.<br/><br/>Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassevetes) Woodhouse are a young married couple who are going to move into a new apartment. The one they pick is located next to the Castevets, a seemingly pleasant elderly couple. Guy takes an instant liking to the Castavets, but Rosemary finds them to be rather nosy, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) in particular. However, shortly after Rosemary gets pregnant, strange things start to happen.<br/><br/>The key to the success of any movie is its credibility (I use the word ""credible"" with the knowledge that some movies, such as Lord of the Rings, have no use for believability. The audience only has to buy them within its own context). Polanski understands this, and the way he chooses to develop this is not only effective, but completely original. Bad things start to happen when Rosemary takes the advice of the Castevets, if only out of politeness. For example, when Minnie asks her what doctor she is seeing, Minnie insists that she see a different one, one that she trusts. Rosemary is already comfortable with her own doctor, but being polite she takes Minnie's advice (I suppose it helps that the doctor Minnie suggests has a good reputation too, which, in the hands of Polanski and his excellent actors, enhances the credibility instead of making it overkill).<br/><br/>The performances are excellent. Mia Farrow and John Cassevetes make a great couple with tremendous chemistry. It's easy to believe that they are a loving husband and wife. The other two principal characters, Minnie and Roman (Sidney Blackmer) are perfect equals to the Woodhouses. They don't develop the Castavets as characters, instead they act like a real elderly retired couple. Ruth Gordon is especially good at this, but perhaps that's because she has a good deal more screen time than her on screen husband. Everyone can see a lot of an elderly retired woman with a lot of time on her hands. Someone who loves to socialize, and is helpful to the point where it is a turnoff to others (though she doesn't realize it). This level of credibility can only come from a talented director and a terrific cast of actors who really care about the project they are working on.<br/><br/>I guess for some people, adding the element of ""is she crazy or is this for real"" gives a film another level of complexity, and heightens the level of fear. Maybe its because I've seen a number of films like this recently (the beginning of ""The Descent"" being one of them), or maybe it's just a personal preference, but I find that being able to put a face on my fear more refreshing (provided it's done well). Nevertheless, this uncertainty is conveyed perfectly, as I can say with absolute truthfulness that until the time that Polanski intended for the truth to come out, I had no idea if Rosemary was crazy or not.<br/><br/>Kudos to Polanski for being able to hold everything together for the whole film, at least until the final shot (warning: MAJOR SPOILER ahead). When Rosemary was pressured by Roman Castavet to be a mother to her child (being the newly spawn of Satan), I didn't buy her giving in. Her erratic fear that made up the majority of the film was too potent for that kind of an about face.<br/><br/>Still, this is a good little chiller. Not too frightening or disturbing, and except for the aftermath of a ""suicide"", there's no real violence or gore to speak of. It's the mark of a superb chiller, one that doesn't use violence and gore to make up for it's lack of ideas and skill."

Also, some of it is boring, and not all is very scary. But the parts that are: *shiver*! Roman Polanski is a good director of horror. I did not think much of the ending was good, but my favorite line is when Minnie Castavet(Ruth Gordon) remarks: ""He chose you, honey! From all the women in the world to be the mother of his only living son!"" Obviously playing on the Jesus story, Minnie says this in her strong, New York accent, making the situation almost comical.<br/><br/>All in all, a very creepy movie!"

Despite its age (1968), I had never seen the film and thought it was some classic horror, like The Exorcist or something. Boy was I wrong. And so was everybody else that said how scary this film was.<br/><br/>What I saw in watching Rosemary's Baby was old-school infantile acting, where everyone presents themselves as overly happily or stresses the emotion they are trying to convey to the point it comes off as sappy. While I can't overly slant Mia Farrow for her part in the film (she plays a meek young woman very well), her role as Rosemary had me feeling like she was a complete bimbo. I have seen my share of old films and don't know why but all of the characters do seem too scripted. Maybe we just have better actors today or better script writers (???).<br/><br/>What will surprise you and make you think differently about your grandmother and society in the 60's is the use of nudity in this film. There is even one scene (SPOILER) where Rosemary is raped by the Devil and is in bondage while a bunch of old croons stand around as naked voyeurs witnessing some bizarre live sex act. That part was shocking, but certainly not scary. The film is so predictable (maybe Polanski wanted it to be that way) that you begin to second guess yourself. You're thinking that the director has led you down an obvious path just to surprise you somewhere else. But unfortunately, no surprises. The film is quite transparent, except for the ending, which is just bizarrely ridiculous. Qualities of Rosemary's Baby, especially the repetitively eerie lullaby in the beginning and end, had me thinking Stanley Kubrick directed this. 5/10<br/><br/>How much more annoying could Mrs. Castevet get!?"

Rosemary's Baby is often cited as being one of the best horror films ever made, and there is a good reason for this. The genre is famous more for blood and scenes that make the audience squirm - Rosemary's baby doesn't feature any of that, but it does feature an atmosphere of constant dread and a plot that always remains interesting even when the pace is rather slow, and that more than makes up for any gratuitous scenes of gore. The plot is fairly simple and focuses on young couple, Guy (an actor) and Rosemary Woodhouse. They move in to a new apartment building and meet a friendly elderly couple living next door, Roman and Minnie Castevet. Guy begins to spend a lot of time with the couple next door, and before long Rosemary has become pregnant - strangely around the same time she has a dream about being raped by something inhuman. As soon as the neighbours realise she pregnant, they take a keen interest; and strange things start to happen.<br/><br/>The rights to Ira Levin's novel were originally acquired by William Castle; and while I don't mean to discredit Castle as I do love most of his work, I have to say that I'm glad that Polanski was brought in to direct as this is not the sort of plot that Castle would have done well with. This film is the second (and best) part of a trilogy of films by Roman Polanksi focusing on Paranoia - the other two being Repulsion and The Tenant. Polanski's direction is really what makes this film what it is; while the plot often plays out like a soap opera and there are periods where nothing really happens, though the atmosphere hanging over the mystery of the story - as well as the fact that we know certain things that are unknown to the central character - ensure that the film is always interesting. I wont spend too much time talking about the actors; but suffice to say, all four of the central performances are excellent; Ruth Gordon's supporting role representing on the few times that a horror film has been recognised by the Academy. It all boils down to a fantastic final ten minutes, which manages to be chilling while still following what has gone before it - i.e. not showing the audience everything. Overall, it's impossible to deny that Rosemary's Baby is a masterpiece and also one of the true 'must see' horror films."

","It doesn't suffice to call ""Rosemary's Baby"" a horror film; that implies something corny. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is anything but corny. It is actually creepy. The plot of course has weak-looking Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) getting pregnant and discovering that the father is Satan; Rosemary's husband Guy (John Cassavetes) is colluding with Satan-worshipping neighbors Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) so that he can get a part in a play. This has the very distinct Ira Levin feel in the way that ""The Stepford Wives"" and ""The Boys from Brazil"" did: everything looks normal, but as the story progresses, you begin to get the feeling that something's not right, and then you find out the horrible truth.<br/><br/>Here's something that I noticed about the movie (maybe it was just a coincidence): the name Roman Castevet. The first name brings to mind director Roman Polanski, and the last name brings to my mind John Cassavetes. But like I said, that's probably just a pure coincidence. I think that my favorite scene is when Rosemary is playing with the Scrabble tiles and finds out about the connection with Adrian Marcato.<br/><br/>And one more thing. This might be the only thing in the whole movie that gives it a slightly non-horrific, even remotely silly flavor: the woman who played Elise Dunstan was Emmaline Henry, better known as Amanda Bellows on ""I Dream of Jeannie"". Ruth Gordon later co-starred with an ""IDOJ"" cast member in 1976's zany ""The Big Bus"" (which co-starred Larry Hagman). Well..."
"flicklover","5","3","6","22 November 2018"," Sorry, I just didn't get it!!!
","I had never watched Rosemary's Baby in in its entirety until yesterday. The times that I started watching it years ago I was so bored that didn't finish. It is so highly regarded as a great horror film that I gave it another chance. This time I watched the whole thing and still don't understand why it's such a classic? I just didn't feel any suspense,dread, horror at all!!! The most that I can say is that it is really weird. Mia Farrow plays the title character. She moves into a new apartment with her husband played by John Cassavetes. They meet the neighbors, which are a series of seemingly nice old people in the building. We then get a very weird scene of her being seemingly raped by a demon with her worshipful neighbors watching. She gets pregnant and begins to get very paranoid and feels that her baby is not of this world. Her husband tries to comfort her but something is off. Everything that happens leads up to Rosemary finding the neighbors worshiping satan and tell her to be a good mother to her child. All of the events leading up to this are presented in a slow, somewhat disturbing way, but I for one wasn't very involved. The film is just weird. I would regard this as a black comedy more than a horror film. It is not bad, the acting is good and it is certainly original, but I don't see why people regard it as such a classic."
"nightsinmoria","6","3","6","2 November 2018"," Overrated? Yes. But...
","Just recently watched this for the first time, after having it on my 'to watch' for many years. Aside from thinking it had something to do with witchcraft or Satanists, i knew nothing about the plot. To call it a horror movie, to me, that's misleading, i would consider this drama/thriller. I enjoyed it, but still found it disappointing. Polanski's direction and Mia Farrow's acting are the stand-outs, yet Ruth Gordon wins an Oscar for her role? One more example of the Academy getting it all wrong. Mia is perfectly cast, much like Shelly Duvall in The Shining, their vulnerability and isolation is what is truly frightening in their journey.<br/><br/>If you like constant cheap jump scares like Insidious or gore like Saw, perhaps this isn't the film for you. It's slow pace is deliberate but the finale doesn't quite pay off. It could have built up the suspense more, and i think having Rosemary watching her neighbors through the closet earlier in the film and getting more information would have helped play up her possible paranoia.<br/><br/>As for the finale, the chanting of 'hail Satan!' comes off more comedic than creepy. But maybe in 1968 that was pushing the envelope, and if so, fair enough ."
"banazap","Null","3","6","4 November 2017"," Doesn't age well, annoying...
","The only thing I like about this movie is the intro with the view of New York city and the soft music playing in the background. Everything else is a 1/10.<br/><br/>The entire movie is just annoying, the redhead who has the baby appears dumbfounded, confused, and mumbles through the whole movie. The old lady neighbors voice is straight annoying and obnoxious.<br/><br/>Its too bland and boring."
"pl333","Null","3","6","1 May 2001"," don't watch this if you like big titty, explosion, bloody killer stuff
","(careful of them there spoilers!)<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is a standout in the genre of gothic psychological thrillers.  Hitchcock's Rebecca is the only other film I know at the top of that category, and of all Horror films only a handful can compete with it for ""best ever.""<br/><br/>Polanski's direction is simply amazing.  A good common description in a lot of these reviews would be ""hallucinatory paranoia.""  The film creates a sense of dislocation, through the juxtaposition of occult imagery with a modern urban setting, and a subtle sense of building tension, through devices such as the deadline of the baby's expectancy date vs. the conspiracy being woven around Rosemary.  These devices enhance her vulnerability and sympathetic quality, and make every hinted threat feel like a threat to you the viewer.  This is a movie that you piece together with your mind but also experience with gut emotion.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from standard crappy blood and guts horror, besides its subtlety, is its metaphoric themes.  The ""Faustian bargain"" made by Rosemary's husband, to further his acting career by selling his fatherhood, reflects on the nature of acts of creation within the entertainment industry and traditional values within organized religion.  I would go so far as to say that this film is intended to criticize bourgeois values within capitalism, through allegory (if I knew more about Polanski's films.)"
"Heimpi","Null","6","16","3 March 2007"," Awful
","Let me first start by saying that I am not a fan of Roman Polanski films. I find them all incredibly dull and very very strange. And this one was no better. The plot was absolutely ridiculous and the ending was horrible. A woman has a baby that turns out to be Satan...what kind of ""classic"" horror film plot is this? Mia Farrow is a great actress, but eve she can't save this pathetic excuse for a psychological horror film. I don't care what others say about this film, but I hated it more than any of Polanski's films and it is most definitely not a classic in my eyes. It's all incredibly boring and I almost fell asleep twice while watching it. It was too long, and for the whole film you were just waiting for something more exciting to happen, but it didn't, just like it never does with any of Polanski's films.<br/><br/>1/10 - don't waste your time."
"hereandnow1","1","15","52","31 August 2004"," horrible movie
","the story of satin impregnating a women and have a human son.sounds like a scary idea right? well this movie isn't, scary that is. the pacing was very,very bad for a horror movie. the acting(except for rosemary and the lady next door) was sup-par, and the music was trying to make something out of nothing. thats the thing that angered me the most about this movie. the music would tense up and then drop off, or it would tense up at a moment that wasn't scary at all. the only redeemable aspect of this movie was an o.k ending and the the performance of the two lead women who play rosemary and the next door neighbor who keeps feeding her those shakes.after seeing this load of garbage I would probably take one those shakes, than watch this movie again."
"mechprince","1","13","44","19 March 2006"," can not help suppressing that helpless feeling
","I did not like it because the movie made me feel like an helpless and impotent person. The storytelling is kind of depressing as it feels like a free fall from a mountain top and the moment we hit rock bottom, the movie is over. If you want to call that a director's punch, feel free to do so. On the brighter side the movie has a good plot, but sadly never reaches a convincing climax. Certainly the movie affects you but I feel it is a cheap tactic to touch the negative nerve to do so. Though my comments might sound cynical, I stand by it and would not recommend this movie for someone who is looking for a good horror plot with interesting twists all finally leading to an edge-of-the-seat climax."
"Ixchell","2","10","32","31 July 2006"," Poorness at its best
","This is not a horror movie, it's a psychological thriller attempting to explain the effects of a single person inside a scary, abusive and controlling system.<br/><br/>I found this movie very disappointing, it's so poor in story and acting that many people had to create their own theories and alternative versions of what went on.<br/><br/>It doesn't has any layers or hidden messages, everything there is to be known is shown in the movie, there's not even a chance for reflection, the audience is given an irrefutable end.<br/><br/>The only interesting thing happening with this movie is how it became a classic and only within a very specific group of people, possibly due to the hype created by those easily impressed with predictability."
"Bababooe","1","9","28","16 September 2017"," Boredom! Overrated. Everything is spelled out. Crappy story and direction. Overlong film. Garbage ending, middle and beginning. Cult film.
","Boredom! Overrated. Everything is spelled out. Fine actors in a sub par story and direction, overlong film. Music sucked. Garbage ending. Garbage middle. Garbage beginning. Cult film. Excellent promotion.<br/><br/>Another cult film disguised as a masterpiece. My first Roman Polanski film and last. I heard about this for years so I sat through this bore-fest, waiting for something to happen. Nothing did.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the most disgusting and simple lullaby soundtrack over decent cinematography of Manhattan. Then we get a scene with completely underused Elisha Cook as a building manager showing an apartment to Mr. and Mrs. Woodhouse, John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow. Elisha Cook was a great actor and I will now recommend you to watch Messiah of Evil. Cook is in only one scene in that movie, but it is great. John Cassavetes is also a solid actor and he's been in some decent crime films. Mia Farrow was decent in the film but not great. The problem with the film is not the actors. It's the screenwriter, a guy named Polanski. The dialogue is all just everyday ordinary small talk boring crap for over 2 hours. It's not a horror film. It's Horrible.<br/><br/>We meet the old neighbors, who are satin worshiping witches, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. These are fine actors. Gordon won the Oscar for her performance. Maurice Herbert Evans plays a friend of the Woodhouses. But could have provided more entertainment if he had the orangutan outfit of Dr. Zaius from Planet of the Apes. Ralph Bellamy is a witch Dr. Abraham Sapirstein, and Charles Grodin as non witch Dr. Hill. All decent actors.<br/><br/>Basic story: The Woodhouses move into an apartment next to witches. The witches cut a deal with the husband to help his acting career if the wife has satin's baby. The wife is drugged, impregnated by satin in a funky dream sequence that everyone who loves this pile of crap says is a great and spooky scene. Dr. Zaius tries to help the wife understand what is going on with the strange behavior of the neighbors and husband, but he is soon put under a coma and dies 3 months later. Now, maybe Polansky would show us a quick scene of Farrow visiting Dr. Zaius at the hospital. No, we just hear about his death 3 months later.<br/><br/>After Zaius is dead, we find out that he came out of the coma briefly to tell the attendants that he has a book for Farrow. Great stuff right? No. The freaking guy just happens to come out of the coma briefly and thinks about Farrow's well being. They say it can only happen in movies and it did here. Now Farrow knows that there is a conspiracy against her and the baby, and she runs away and finds Dr. Hill, the un-witch doctor. The scene where she explains all the witch stuff to Dr. Hill is Unbelievable, again can only happen in movies. Dr. Hill knows she's nuts, has her lie down in a room and calls her husband and the witch Dr. who come and take her back to the apartment, where she eventually has her devil baby. We get some more boredom where they try to drug her and collect her breast milk to feed the devil baby. We get scenes where she hears the baby crying through the walls. Farrow finds a path to the next door apartment with the witches cult and all the idiots yelling Heil Satin! and she sees a baby crib. We never get to see the devil baby. She spits into her husband's face when he says they can now have normal babies. The baby starts to cry and now she accepts the devil baby. The End.<br/><br/>So, is this devil baby the antichrist? Will this baby grow up to destroy the world? Why didn't the witches just impregnate a prostitute or a drugged out bum chick for the devil baby? They mentioned that Rosy was a catholic, was that a prerequisite for the devil to impregnate her? We don't know. We are just brainless movie goers. Who are we to question the great Polansky? FU Polansky! We then get a bonus track of the opening garbage lullaby reminding me that I should have shut it off with the first notes.<br/><br/>Rating 1, or F. Complete failure. No suspense. Everything is spelled out. Unlikable boring characters. Disgusting music.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to mention the phenomenon of cult films. Rosemary's Baby has a cult following, people loving it for some reason, maybe pregnant mothers to be, who knows. Alien is another cult film. I hate the film, mainly because the story, characters, dialogue, everything just plain sucks. Alien won the Oscar for special effects, so maybe people love it for the props and sets. Another cult director is Dario Argeno. I hate his film Suspiria, mainly for the amateur story, acting, basically everything. But, it has a cult following, maybe because of all the funky cartoon colors he uses, or that stupid band Goblin making the music. Argento is crap. And his films Plumage and Four Flies are also crap. I also hate Dawn of the Dead. When I saw that years ago I was impressed. But watching it now, I see it as a cartoon amateur acting and story pile of crap. You need to make up your own mind. Please don't be fooled into loving a film because they label it as an art film.<br/><br/>Recommended instead: Messiah of Evil, Footprints on the Moon, Last Man on Earth, Night of the Living Dead, White Zombie, All the Colors of the Dark, Don't Torture a Duckling.<br/><br/>I skimmed through the IMDb user and critic reviews. Most love this crap as THE BEST HORROR FILM EVER. Nonsense! A handful are awake to this garbage. Click Hated It to see their thoughts."

","OK. Let me get this right - Struggling (but not starving) NYC actor, Guy Woodhouse, is such an unfathomable, low-life, scumbag that (get this!) within the very first evening of meeting his creepy neighbour, Roman Castevets (aka. Steven Marcato) he secretly agrees to offer up his clueless wife, Rosemary, to Satan so that this monster can fornicate with and, yes, ejaculate into her.<br/><br/>And in exchange for this generous donation to the devil of the unenlightened Rosemary, Guy, in turn, is promised great success as a Broadway stage actor (whether he's got any real talent, or not).<br/><br/>You know, you'd honestly think that the totally self-centred Guy would have at least been somewhat more ambitious about his career goal and had demanded that the demon-worshippers had offered him a position as a powerful political figure (like, maybe, a state Senator, or something), instead of settling for the part of being a crummy, little actor.<br/><br/>And, with that said - You'd really think that the Satanists would have strongly encouraged Guy to go into politics, as well. I mean, what the hell good could a nothing stage-actor be to a bunch of first-rate bastards who kissed the very ground that Lucifer walked on? <br/><br/>And, on top of all of that demented bargaining business - You'd also honestly think that Roman and his idiotic brethren would have been able to have rounded up a real hot babe who was actually more than willing to screw with the devil, rather than all of this deceitful nonsense of using the totally ignorant Rosemary and, thus, putting her (and all of us viewers, as well) through all of this bull.<br/><br/>Like, c'mon, folks - If you ask me - This film's over-long and boring story of 135 minutes was utterly brain-dead from start to finish. It really was."

","Who ever says this is scary is nuts. Good maybe but nothing as a 8 star rating this has. I have watched many movies that are scarier than this and people in reviews are calling this creepy and scary. The only weird part of the movie is the rape scene of the devil with her.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is pure drama, with a little comedy. This makes you laugh more than get scared at all. Nothing close to what people call horror. It boggles my mind that you all call this great when I could easily fall asleep during it.<br/><br/>I don't mind watching if nothing else is on television but to call this a horror movie is a little too much. Just because it has no gore, it is better. Hogwash, and pathetic. Violence is better than just sitting around hoping something happens and it doesn't.<br/><br/>Like this movie nothing happens except that scene she gets raped by the devil. Only part that got interesting and then boring through the rest. Rosemary is ugly too. How anyone could think she is hot or anything is beyond me. She is white, almost dead white.<br/><br/>Skinny is not beautiful at all. Look at most models now a days. Toothpicks. Stick figure women is what I thought when watching her in this movie and that other movie she is in, is terrible too. People sitting around talking throughout the whole movie is not entertaining.<br/><br/>To each their own on liking this one. It is just a time waster to me. They do show it on television when nothing good is on, and that does not mean this is a great movie either. Just because it is rating an 8.0 does not mean a thing.<br/><br/>Go ahead and say you enjoyed it. I did not but it is bad when there is nothing else to watch."

","Try this, compare Rosemary's Baby to all the horror movies that came out in 1968 and does anything hold a candle to this film's production, cinematography, flawless editing and high level acting? Speaking only to Roman Polanski's film-making, it's really a shame that there isn't many risk takers to produce a good written horror film like him. Mia Farrow does a terrific job in portraying a normal outgoing city-dweller who turns into a paranoid, helpless mess. It's in the details of Farrow's reactions and elegant line delivery that really make some scenes chilling. Rosemary's Baby however, does fall short in really memorable moments and an impactful ending. There's no doubting it's a superbly made film, but there is blandness as the film draws out longer, longer. A little over-hyped possibly, but still a must see film."

Was it fear of letting down Sinatra (who got her the part) that drove Mia to such unsurpassed excellence? Or was it Mr. Polanski? (Hint: See answer B).<br/><br/>Because everyone is excellent -- from Ruth Gordon's much worse than nebby NYC neighbor (which won her the Oscar), to Maurice Evans' fatherly hero gone hospital. From Charles Grodin's warm-hearted Dr. Hill gone-to-hell betrayal, to Tony Curtis' absorbing (& uncredited) telephone voice-over work as the actor blinded by witchcraft. This is brilliant ensemble mojo that completely belies the film's 1968 made-on stamp.<br/><br/>But let's get to the cancerous red meat here, this film eats at you because Polanski is always in charge. He's working closely with cinematographer William A. Fraker (who shot the fantastic San Francisco car chase sequences from Steve McQueen's Bullitt that same year), so that every unspoken word is captured by extreme facial close-up, and every chaotic stumble, by handheld cam in real time (which was cutting edge in '68), and the dream sequence montages are legendary, with editing of the highest order.<br/><br/>And oh my, of course, I could never forget to mention that hauntingly ideal ""la-la-la"" theme and an overall score that gets you in the mood to look away, just when you know you can't. The cumulative filmmaking extras here never get in the way, while always involving the viewer in a believable, empathetic tale of vulnerability exploited.<br/><br/>Unlike the horror of today, Rosemary's Baby is frightening while still being fully humane, treating characters with the respect humans deserve, even the despicable ones. That's partly why it consistently scores Top 10 rankings in the ""best of"" horror film lists regurgitated this time of year.<br/><br/>But I'm here to tell you that Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby has a well-earned stake in the claim for ""best of"" and ""top ten"", no matter the genre or holiday. This is art and entertainment, in one. And it's a flick that's still going to fly long after you, I and Rosemary's baby's baby's baby are dead and gone."

"zkonedog","9","2","4","6 March 2017"," A Creepy Thriller For The Ages
","All too many times, movies that fancy themselves ""thrillers"" are really nothing of the sort. They are either too gory or too short (e.g. not well thought-out) to be regarding as true classics. In the case of ""Rosemary's Baby"", however, director Roman Polanski crafts an epic tale that will forever stand the test of time.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy (John Cassavetes), a young couple moving into a new apartment complex. They quickly make the acquaintance of older neighbors Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and seem to have forged a sort of friendship with them. When Rosemary becomes pregnant, however, she begins to expect that perhaps the friendliness of the neighbors has a sinister ulterior motive regarding a higher power at work.<br/><br/>This movie is so creepy (and thus ultimately such a classic) because it is so understated. The characters of Rosemary and Guy are so true-to-life in their portrayal of young, married life that the viewer cannot help but identify with them. In short, we see ourselves in them, which makes us root for (or against) the events surrounding them that much more. There is no blood or guts in this one, but rather just an atmosphere of tension that continues to build and build as the minutes tick by.<br/><br/>Granted, however, that this is not a film for youngsters by any means. It is very adult-themed and contains material that may truly haunt younger-than-adolescent minds. That is part of the reason why the film stands up so well, though, as it contains none of the childish ""slasher/gore"" mentality of most horror flicks.<br/><br/>Finally, ""Rosemary's Baby"" can also (from today's perspective) be viewed as a nice period piece. I believe Polanski must have suspected it would be looked at as such too, as many pop culture references are strategically placed throughout the flick.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the classic suspense/thriller pictures of all-time. The plot of the film (which I won't divulge here) is almost a bit clichéd now due to overuse, but this original is still as striking as I'm sure it was in the 1960s. If you like those ""uncomfortable"" movie experiences that might have you sleeping with a night-light for a night or two, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is for you."

","If you haven't seen Rosemary's Baby (1968) yet, you are missing one of the most beautiful yet haunting experiences you'll ever get in life. it'd probably hold second or third positions in my list of favorite horror films. Rosemary's Baby works because of: 1. Mia Farrow: this has got to be some masterful acting. When she felt a pain in her stomach, I felt it too. Her transformation from an independent and strong woman to a helpless weakling is done beautifully. The haircut is one of the best things that was done to further this weakness. Plus her acting is so real, so unlike the typical 60's acting style. She wasn't a dumb character, she knew her surroundings well. She knew something was up. Her confusion and fear was needed. 2. The rest of the cast: Ruth Gordon, and the actor who played Mia's husband (can't remember his name, John something) were breathtaking. How well they play their characters! Even at the end when you may expect a slight shift in their character, they don't. And it is all the more beautiful. 3. The story: the story of a mysterious pregnancy is fresh and frightening, and I'm getting tired of explaining this stuff so I'm just gonna list them out now. 4. The masterful direction 5. The colors 6. The script 7. The storytelling 8. The ending. A brilliantly executed Horror film that is easily one of the the most unsettling films ever made. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"seda_ades5","10","2","4","3 June 2011"," a true classic
","Roman Polanski's horror classic is literally pregnant with paranoia... In the movie the colors and the places which are used by Roman Rolanski are so impressive that when rosemary gets out to the house, you don't want her to get back to the house again. In the movie the director leaves the horror part to the audience's imagination. I think it's amazing when a horror movie can be created without blood and the effects like that. Therefore the movie can terrify the audience even more so. In this movie for you a man who is in front of the phone booth can be a horror object. I think this movie has an impact on the other horror movies. The soundtracks also have haunting sides. For example a lullaby, which is performed by Mia Farrow, can terrify the audience. And also the Beethoven's Fur Elise which is used in some scenes of movie (especially in the kitchen scenes) effects audience and has a great impact on the movie. Mia Farrow acting is so perfect. In her performance we can see the catholic girl – Rosemary- clearly. She acts every emotion and thoughts well enough so one can easily understand what is she thinking or feeling at the moment. I think it is an excellent part of the movie that the baby's face isn't seen in the movie. With this detail Polanski leaves the baby to our imagination and thanks to Rosemary's reactions we can guess what he looks like. If we can see the baby that may be less terrifying. There are good scenes, and excellent camera by Polanski. I like scenes in films where the camera follows the character. There are some haunting scenes where you think about the horror of it later. Polanski did not go for cheap scares. In this case you could enjoy the movie much more than you could enjoy the cheap bloody scary movies."
"accattone74","10","2","4","16 November 2010"," One of the Best
","Rosemary's Baby is one of the best horror movies of all time. <br/><br/>Whenever I say this to someone I'm often barraged by a flurry of ""What?! How!? Why?! But it's not even scary! Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film! There's like barely any blood! The movie doesn't even have an on-screen death!"" (If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that Hell hath no fury like a contradicted, overly invested genre-lover.)<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby was not just a jolt to the horror genre upon its initial release, but it permeated popular culture in a way not seen since Psycho eight years earlier. Based on the 1967 Ira Levin novel of the same name, Rosemary's Baby is an almost verbatim recreation of its source text. Ira Levin was also the man behind The Stepford Wives and The Boys from Brazil, so something tells me Mr. Levin had a thing for conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>In Rosemary's Baby the conspiracy's ringleader is supposedly none other than Satan himself, out to plant his anti-Christ seed into a ripe field, i.e. the as-of-yet-unused womb of some docile, domestic, husband-trusting, innocent-enough, almost ex-Catholic girl. Rosemary Woodhouse is the lady in question. Her husband, Guy, may or may not have sold her drugged-up body one night to the maybe-Satanic Castevets, the neighbors with whom the Woodhouse's share a wall, in order for her to be raped by the Devil and become a vessel for said demon seed (or was Rosemary just having a bad dream that night?) You see, Guy's a struggling actor, so you know he'd sell his soul in a heartbeat for success, so what's his wife's womb to him, right? After all, Guy is getting pretty chummy with those nosy, old, childless Castevets. Their chanting and flute-playing coming from next door, their nomadic, theatrical background, and those scathing remarks against the Pope – something just isn't right with the Castevets.<br/><br/>Rosemary soon finds herself pregnant (but with whose baby?), cut-off from her young friends (associating only with the Castevets and their sect of elders), and getting rather unorthodox Ob-Gyn treatment from a Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (raw egg & fresh herb smoothies constitute Rosemary's diet under his care, also something called Tanas Roothmmm, what's THAT an anagram for I wonder?) Her first trimester is nothing but pain, weight loss, anemia, vomiting, and a fondness for raw liver (yuck!) And those who come in contact with her from outside 'the group' often meet bad ends. Poor Rosemary. Is there a plot against her baby? Or is it all being done FOR the baby?<br/><br/>With every viewing (and there have been scores of them), I see a little more, hear a little more, and understand a little more – continually revealing itself and affecting me anew like any great work of art should. I guess one could call Rosemary's Baby the horror movie that keeps on giving. All the acting is excellent too, especially, of course, the Oscar-winning performance by Ruth Gordon as the meddlesome minion of Satan, Minnie Castevet. Even Mia Farrow, whom I normally don't equate with great acting, except Broadway Danny Rose, actually holds her own in scenes with the indomitable John Cassavetes. Her finest moment in the film, if not in her whole career, is arguably the phone booth scene.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is an extraordinary picture in that it conveys so much information, it illustrates so much of its motive, and makes privy its truths long before Rosemary knows them herself, but yet somehow it can fill a viewer with constant and complete suspense. And Rosemary's predicament isn't exactly something new in the realm of storytelling; in fact it's formulaic in many ways. When you go into a film knowing it's supposed to be horrific, but are not given any strong shocks or scares for almost the first hour – that alone creates tension to me. But it is this particular fact about Rosemary's Baby that makes many question its 'horror movie' standing.<br/><br/>So what makes a horror movie then? Is it any film whose plot attempts to elicit fright, fear or terror from its audience? Or does a horror film just need to have actual scares – something that'll make you jump in your seat, or at least make you squirmy? Does a horror movie have to be a symphony of blood, gore, constant score, and speed-of-light editing these days, a 'gruesical' if you will? Has genre, if not the entire definition of what makes a ""good"" movie, been kidnapped by technique? Less than three second shot lengths are the mean for a horror film today. Faster and faster pacing. Build-up. Viscera! The visceral. Splatter! Build-up. Gore! Build-up. Murder! Build-up. Big Splatter! Conclusion. One more scare! Lights up. Yawn.<br/><br/>The time when Rosemary's Baby is seen as a genuine horror movie might be dead, but is that our loss? Yes. Most often, I hear Rosemary's Baby referred to as not a horror film, but rather a suspense film, and that any horror it may contain is strictly psychological, and therefore not truly scary. All I know is that Poe, Henry James, Lovecraft, de Maupassant, and Jacques Tourneur are the real forefathers of Rosemary's Baby, not Universal Monsters, Hammer Horror's bat-bitten boobies, Corman's explicitness or H.G. Lewis' gore. I believe what has come to be called ""psychological-horror"", is in fact the purest form of horror - a majority of violence, blood, gore, and brutality does not a horror movie make.<br/><br/>The autonomy created by city living transformed into a nightmarish, hell-on-earth conspiracy scenario is as relevant today as 1968, if not more so. The daily questioning of one's sanity. To find yourself constantly analyzing the motivations of others. Suspicion towards a loved one. To feel completely isolated and alone, yet surrounded by millions. Immersing myself into these ideas for 136 minutes is far scarier to me than any of the zombies, slashers, torturers or mutants of today."
"secondtake","10","2","4","10 June 2010"," Sensational, yes, but sensationally well made...
","Rosemary's Baby (1968)<br/><br/>Along with the Exorcist (1973), Rosemary's Baby helped shatter taboos in mainstream Hollywood. It builds around Rosemary's pregnancy in a New York City apartment building with nice but nosey neighbors, and Mia Farrow plays the growing paranoia and genuine fear perfectly. This is a psychological thriller told and filmed with naturalism (along with a few surreal dream and nightmare scenes), and editing with smart efficiency so there is no let up in our descent into horror. Director Roman Polanski also wrote the screenplay, and it's a classic construction.<br/><br/>Face it, the story, and the willingness of the movie makers to tell it like it is, is a mind blower. Yes, we've heard or imagined such things in jokes or in our own nightmares (heaven forbid). But never spelled out step by step and made reasonable, or likely. The cast around Farrow is really impeccable. Her husband (John Cassavetes, who knows something about how to make a movie himself) and the two neighbors (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) are absolutely convincing in their innocent, lovable guises. Even when you start to be suspicious something is wrong, you don't realize just how wrong it can be.<br/><br/>Thankfully this isn't a Gothic horror film, laying into the macabre and occult aspects (it brushes against them just enough). Because it's really a psychological thriller. You might even expect Hitchcock to have liked the idea, but I suspect he would have shied away from the subject matter, at least the way Polanski had the fears develop into a real horror. It's only at the end that we see a different side to the story, going beyond our worries about Rosemary and her baby. And this is the sensational part of the movie that made everyone talk about it. And for me, it wasn't necessary. It wan't unnecessary, but it ends up tilting the whole flavor of the movie a bit into something campy and even silly, though everyone plays it with perfect realism.<br/><br/>But I think most people will just gasp and be impressed by the whole thing, including the end. It's not a fun film but it's fun to watch, a treat to really study how all the elements, including camera-work (walking down halls, peering through peepholes) add up to a peculiar, masterful, memorable gem."
"bpiscitello-1","10","2","4","26 July 2008"," Elaborate metaphor for coming to terms with new in-laws?
","I've just returned home from a midnight theatrical screening of RB at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. It is early a.m. on 26 July 2008. The print shown at the Nuart was an ""archival print"" from Paramount (or so we were told prior to the screening). The print screened was flawless and well worth the $10.50 ticket price. I've seen RB before, but never in a theater. What a rare experience.<br/><br/>I should say that I consider RB to be the greatest horror film of all time. I think this because its suspense and horror are psychological and implied rather than physical and explicit (which is what seems to be the norm in the horror genre today). You're drawn into the story because the characters are normal and everyday rather than exceptional, freakish, and/or overwrought.<br/><br/>In terms of my perceptions/thoughts about the deeper themes of RB, on this viewing I've gone beyond the usual and more obvious viewer's concerns (the Devil; Rosemary's hysteria that builds throughout the film) and hit on what I think may be a novel take on the story.<br/><br/>If one assumes the Castevets (Minnie and Roman played by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer respectively) and the witch coven to be a stand-in for husband Guy's family, is the entire story an elaborate metaphor for a young wife adjusting to new in-laws? (This idea is not without humor, of course.)<br/><br/>The (mostly) young women at the screening, in particular, seemed enthralled by the story, told, as it is, with Rosemary at its center. Was their enrapture a form of apprehension looking, as they are, ahead in their lives rather than backward? I've never read any critical analysis of RB, so it's possible that my ideas are not original.<br/><br/>What do you think?"
"gavin6942","8","2","4","25 November 2007"," The Biggest Satanic Cult Film Ever Made?
","Guy and Rosemary move into a new apartment (the Bramford) and hope to have a baby. But Guy is having trouble finding work as an actor. Once his luck improves, Rosemary is pregnant and her pregnancy becomes more and more unbearable and her neighbors even more and more strange and intruding. What is going on in this apartment? <br/><br/>I want to say Mia Farrow was pretty hot in this movie. I don't know why. I mean, she's really not all that hot, and for a good part of the movie she has very short hair which is generally very unattractive on women. Even Guy tells Rosemary that her haircut is the biggest mistake she ever made (and I'm inclined to agree). Yet, you got me Mia... well played.<br/><br/>I'm also concerned about the film's anti-Semitism. I've never heard anyone accuse the film of anti-Semitism before, but it seemed possible to me. The satanic doctor had a Jewish-sounding name and the satanic neighbor lady had a very stereotypical Jewish manner about her. Now, it's never stated anyone is Jewish, but it seems to me like that is what Polanski was hinting at. Which is very odd, having Jews be running a Satanic cult to harm Catholic women. I mean, having a cult is one thing, but a Jewish devil-worshiping cult seems like a bad idea.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is of course very good. It's now roughly forty years old and still a classic by both horror and general cinema standards. And I'm not going to say the people who have judged it so are wrong. It really broke ground in some ways. A rape scene involving Satan? You don't see that a lot in movies, at least not in movies that many mainstream people watch. Which is perhaps too bad. I like a good bit of devil rape every now and then.<br/><br/>But yeah, the plot is good, the acting good (Rosemary comes off as really naive and far too submissive, but it was the 1960s so I guess that happens). The suspense was very nice, and although the audience is usually two steps ahead of Rosemary in figuring things out, it's nice to see her come across the twists and turns -- is she going mad or is there really something dark lurking under every cradle? <br/><br/>Watch this film, if for no other reason than to see D'Urville Martin (""Dolemite"") or hear the voice of Tony Curtis. Or wonder why Mia Farrow can maintain a hotness with short hair. There's no real nudity, no real gore (in fact, none). But this is classic story-telling at its finest. I watched it again in honor of writer Ira Levin's passing, but you don't need a special occasion to enjoy this one."

","""Rosemary's Baby"" is the first generation gap horror movie. 60s ""It"" girl Mia Farrow plays a sweet young thing who moves into an exclusive Manhattan apartment building with her struggling actor husband John Cassavetes, who brings his usual edgy neurosis to the part. All their neighbors are elderly, and it turns out that they are also a coven of witches whose mission is to find the perfect mother for the devil's child. Rosemary, whose name is oddly reminiscent of the Virgin Mary, is the perfect choice, and her actor hubby is quite happy to sell his soul to Satan in return for help with his career. Like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""The Killers,"" ""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of those movies that captures a vivid snapshot of the paranoia and unrest of the 60s, a decade that began so promisingly but that ended in assassination, riot, and social unrest. Holocaust survivor Roman Polanski, who was soon to lose his pregnant wife Sharon Tate to the murderous Manson ""family,"" directed, closely following Ira Levin's brilliant novel and in the process creating ""Catholic horror."" Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are excellent as the nosy neighbors who turn out to be the devil's henchmen, as is Ralph Bellamy as the sinister doctor who's part of the conspiracy. Shakespearean veteran Sir Maurice Evans (Maurice on ""Bewitched"") plays the one sympathetic old person in the movie. ""Rosemary's Baby"" set a standard for Hollywood horror that has seldom been equalled and never excelled. Only ""The Exorcist,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""The Shining"" come close. Of films made during the last decade only ""The Blair Witch Project"" approaches the same standard."
"J. Spurlin","Null","2","4","12 December 2006"," Great fun: a film that takes the best part of any horror movie and makes it the whole show
","I saw this at a revival theater a few years ago, and it was one of the best times I've had at the movies. I won't post any spoilers, but I recommend that you read nothing about this movie before you see it. Part of my pleasure was in expecting a certain event to occur earlier in the film: I thought ""Rosemary's Baby"" was going to be about a rampaging demon baby. This misconception helped keep me gripped in suspense until the end.<br/><br/>Now that I've watched it again on DVD, I can appreciate it as well as enjoy it. Here's why it was so fun: my favorite part of any horror film is first twenty minutes or so leading up to the first appearance of the monster. It doesn't matter how enjoyable the monster is; the best part is always the wait. This principle works in such diverse films as ""Them!"" (waiting for the killer ants), ""King Kong"" ( for the giant ape), ""Psycho"" ( for the shower scene) and so on. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is all wait, and it's marvelously effective. (But does a monster finally appear at the end? See the movie.)<br/><br/>Roman Polanski directs his own script based on Ira Levin's novel (which I read later and enjoyed); he is extremely clever at tantalizing us and dropping clues. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her actor-husband Guy (John Cassavetes) have moved into a new apartment in an old 19th century building which has a bad reputation for murders and strange deaths that occur on its premises. They befriend the old couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) next door who are nosy and eccentric but later seem more sinister. When Rosemary gets pregnant, she begins to suspect her neighbors are witches.<br/><br/>The casting is important. Rosemary must be weak-willed but not so passive that she becomes irritating or unsympathetic: Mia Farrow is perfect. Cassavetes plays an unsympathetic jerk yet allows us to see his moral struggle, mainly hidden from his wife (and only suggested to the audience). Sidney Blackmer seems gracious and charming, yet conveys something dark underneath. Ruth Gordon steals the show, a wacky oddball who becomes terrifying.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski delivers a slowly-paced film that screws our attention to the sticking place for two hours and fifteen minutes. You can't ask for more fun than that."

","""Rosemary's Baby"" is, without a doubt, my favorite horror film.  Instead of relying on blood and violence to scare audiences it uses genuine psychological tension.  This film shows that you don't need to witness gore and violence in order to be scared.  <br/><br/>I think what makes this movie scary and disturbing is the fact that all these terrible things are happening to such an innocent, trusting and helpless character like Rosemary.  Casting the then 22-year-old Mia Farrow was ideal.  A delicate beauty, Farrow projects Rosemary's vulnerability to perfection.  Never have I felt sorry for a character the way I feel sorry for Rosemary in this film.  The paranoia and tension she experiences throughout the film is contagious.<br/><br/>You can particularly empathize with her at the party scene when her girlfriends are comforting her in the kitchen.  What makes this scene so painful is that it shows how truly alone Rosemary is, the way her pent-up anxiety pours out in the presence of her estranged friends.  The compassion she receives is very moving.  The scene where she contacts Dr. Hill from the phone booth is another one of my favorites, because it gives you a nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach as well as a glimmer of hope that someone may finally believe and help Rosemary.  The fact that we trust Dr. Hill the way Rosemary trusts him makes his ultimate betrayal all the more horrifying.<br/><br/>It is too bad that Roman Polanski's most recent films aren't of this caliber.  Before he directed ""Rosemary's Baby"" he directed ""Repulsion"", another great psychological thriller.  Both of these movies are creepy in ways most movies are not.  The apartments in both films provide great atmosphere.  To anyone who happens to read this review, I urge you to rent both this film and ""Repulsion"" for Halloween night.  They make a great double feature!"

","Rosemary's Baby is one of the scariest movies I've seen. The atmosphere and rising tension really make this movie. All of the acting is great, especially from the main lead. She does an excellent job and I can really believe her fear and paranoia. The movie doesn't rely on jumpscares or gore, rather slow build up and little things where you know something is wrong, but you don't know what. Another scary aspect is that all of the characters besides Rosemary, act as if nothing is wrong, making her and the audience more paranoid as to who is hiding something, causing distrust and fear. This is a slow burn, but it is greatly worth the watch."

","Review of Rosemary's Baby<br/><br/>Polanski's 1968 Rosemary's Baby is what I class as an engaging, disturbing and highly intelligent psychological horror. The movie left me with a chill and a specific feeling of sympathy for Rosemary's character; the betrayals she endured, specifically from Guy, her husband, and others such as Dr Hill. The acting is truly inspiring for its age, and I think many actors and actresses can still find inspiration for it in the movie industry today. A particularly good example is through many of the characters' facial expressions within scenes of hinted importance. The supernatural narrative of the film was particularly psychologically thrilling and fear-inducing; Rosemary's dream of being raped by the devil (which turns out to be reality) along with the evidence she finds for the cult her neighbours are involved with. This, along with many other factors, makes Rosemary's Baby a suitable horror for any film lover of the horror genre, along with classing it as horror masterpiece of the 20th century, and Polanski for directing a work of cinema that still holds up today."

","The ancient practice of witchcraft in Swinging 60's New York.<br/><br/>Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move into the gothic apartment building known as The Bramford. Guy is an actor who doesn't seem to be getting the big breaks he deserves. That is until he meets the eccentric couple Minnie and Roman next door and then suddenly his luck changes. Could this change in his fortunes be coincidence or is there more than meets the eye?<br/><br/>Everything about this film is perfect.<br/><br/>On watching this masterpiece again I really tuned into the themes of gaslighting, narcissism and coercive control that occur between the characters who have something to hide from poor Rosemary. Check out the subtle exchange of glances that are swapped between Guy, Minnie and Roman after the Castavets are told that Rosemary is pregnant.<br/><br/>The film is also about abuse and the need for the victim of that abuse to speak her truth and have her voice heard. The scene of her telling what she believes to be the truth to Charles Grodin's Dr Hill is both liberating but then ultimately heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Watch out for Polanski's direction and marvel at how deft, innovative and revolutionary it is. The scene where Minnie is sat on Rosemary's bed just out of view still makes me crane my neck to look around the door frame to see her more clearly. Now thats genius.<br/><br/>The film builds to one of the most unsettling climaxes in film history. And then the scene after that is is even more disconcerting.<br/><br/>Ruth Gordon's performance is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. The perfect alignment of perfect writing with an actress who was born to play the part.<br/><br/>Look out for the cameo by William Castle.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough.

The main Idea is simple, but the plot and the way this film was written and directed really makes this film what it is.
The sound track is suspensful, creepy and really adds to the film and makes it as scary as it is. And you have to give credit where it is do Mia Farrow and her co-stars all gave terrific performances, very convincing, authentic and impressive. What else can you really say about this film? Its practically perfect. The pacing feels slow but if you follow the story and pay close attention Polanski's story telling is actually really captivating.

Nudity, drugs, flashbacks, illusions and the occult are the themes that swirl amidst the mounting suspense with New York City as the looming backdrop. A nostalgic glimpse into late-'60s New York as the city passes in a time capsule comveying the fashion, things, and the mood and the vibe of the age. A ditzy and luminous Mia Farrow is the blonde top who's the beacon of innocence railing against age and tradition. ""The Trial"" as supernatural, the film disturbingly unsettles as it tensely conjures the rising madness that ensues when sanity is gone and one is left with oneself and infinity.

","Roman Polanski, as vile a human being as he is, is a master cinematic craftsman. In Rosemary's Baby he has taken the anxiety surrounding pregnancy and childbirth (especially when its one's first) and blown it up into a full blown horror epic.<br/><br/>Rosemary, played by a young Mia Farrow, is somewhat naive, but by not means stupid. Married to an aspiring actor, the two move into a new building, where they are immediately ""befriended"" by their new neighbors.<br/><br/>So here, I have a bit of a confession to make: I find most horror movies hilarious and grossly implausible.<br/><br/>Rosemary's new neighbors are over the top intrusive. They're constantly dropping by. I doubt a normal person would let this sort of situation continue very long, but for some reason, they go with it. In fact, the husband becomes rather more chummy with the neighbors than seems normal. (We find out why later in the film)<br/><br/>Second point of implausibility: Rosemary's obstetrician tells her not to listen to anyone or read any books about pregnancy. Maybe things were different in the 60s, but I'd think a doctor trying to discourage a patient from getting information would be a giant red flag for most people.<br/><br/>But, of course, most horror movies do require us to ignore some implausibilities.<br/><br/>In any case, Rosemary's pregnancy develops. She has pain, which her doctor assures her is normal (it isn't), and every attempt she makes to find out what's going on seems only to bring her back to her husband, her doctor, and her neighbors. She becomes increasingly isolated from her friends.<br/><br/>Eventually, she has her baby, but when she wakes up, the baby is gone. They tell her it was stillborn but she hears a baby crying in the neighbors' apartment. (Third point of implausibility: Why would they keep the baby in a place where Rosemary could so easily find it?)<br/><br/>Rosemary goes next door, and sees a group of people gathered, including her husband and her doctor, and a bassinet draped in black cloth with an inverted cross over it.<br/><br/>After some freaking out by Rosemary, the assembled crew begin shouting ""Hail Satan!""<br/><br/>Again, maybe things were different in the 60s, but honestly, this had me doubled over with laughter. The expressions on the satanists' faces are hilarious, and the whole thing had the air of a huge practical joke.<br/><br/>(The denouement is that the husband had made a deal with the devil to get his acting career moving.)<br/><br/>I gave this move 6/10 only because the technical aspects of the film are brilliant, as is Farrow's performance, and because this has become a cultural touchstone in the horror genre.<br/><br/>The plot however is barely a notch about standard horror fare, and the whole ""hail satan"" thing was just... cheesy.<br/><br/>Also, I feel a little grubby for having watched a Roman Polanski film. We can't forget that he raped a young girl, however technically and artistically gifted he may be."

","In this Christ story-turned-on-its-head, one definitely sympathizes with Mia Farrow as Rosemary.<br/><br/>Her biggest sin is that she trusts her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), who gets lured into a coven operating in the gothic Dakota building on Manhattan's Upper West Side before betraying her cruelly.<br/><br/>Rosemary deals with the most egregious case of gaslighting since the 1944 movie that coined the term, as everyone from Guy to her celebrity OBGYN try to make her disbelieve her own painful perceptions. Her pregnancy occurs via rape by her husband. We know she's not off to a good start.<br/><br/>The film starts out with many marks of the gothic horror tale, as Rosemary and Guy hear about sordid crimes that transpired in their new residence and are warned against moving in.

","Rosemary's Baby is effective horror because it shows so little and suggests so much. Many have mistaken the brief, subliminal flash of the demon eyes near the end as the actual baby's eyes starting back at Rosemary. In reality it is the flashback of Satan himself from her nightmarish memories of the rape. We do not ever actually see the hell-spawn, but are left to imagine its horrific appearance from that classic, spine-chilling line from Farrow: ""What have you done to his eyes, you maniacs?!"" In the vivid, dreamlike sequence where we first are thrust into the demonic world, the nervous, titillating camera perspective, the sound design and the way the edits jump back and forth do a fantastically eerie job of blurring the boundaries between the vision and reality. In fact the whole experience is handled so deftly by Polanski that we have a half-mind to agree with the worries of Dr Hill and call in support for this poor, deluded woman babbling about witchcraft and cultish conspiracies out to get her. <br/><br/>Beneath the horror we also have the subtext of feminist issues which would seem a lot more apparent in the 60s. Horror has taken many elements of Gothicism but here we have Polanski (diligently sticking to Levin) channelling what Ellen Moers referred to as female Gothic, a little known literary movement depicting female heroines trapped and confined within suffocating spaces. Of course in the nineteenth century this was a reaction to an increasingly challenging and diverse literary sphere - whereas within the context of this film we have the female liberation's movement, and an issue very close to the heart of Rosemary, reproduction. So we have an overly dominant patriarchal force babying and forcing Rosemary into domesticity. She's given strange ailments that render her unable to leave the house, and it is only the strong feminine encouragement of her friends that enables her to stop the treatment. Guy's reaction is of course immediately volatile - Cassavetes' character is above all characterised by a tinge of misogyny. Who else would hand over their wife like property in exchange for fame, fortune and prestige?<br/><br/>Another element that makes Rosemary's Baby so effective is Ruth Gordon's Minnie Castevet. She and her husband's constant flirting in and out of the frame tread a fine line between caring and bothersome until it becomes almost to much to bear for Rosemary. In fact they are almost too nice - we see how Polanski has engineered each social situation to wring every last drop of second hand embarrassment that we too want Minnie to stop bothering them because no one could be so selfless and serving. But wisely it is not taken to absurd extremes - partly because it would be overkill and partly because they want their cult to remain hidden. So she lets herself be waved off after pushing Rosemary to consume the drink soon, and doesn't barge into the party because it would be rude (and suspicious). Gordon never once breaks her doting grandmother routine, and this is key - even in the final, haunting reveal, they are all having a jovial little tea party complete with one jolly member taking pictures, and the normalcy with which they proceed draws Rosemary in. Well, it does have its father's eyes, but surely there's a bit of Rosemary in there too."

Perhaps with a better score (I wanted SO MUCH to hear Wojciech Kilar's ""The Storm"" track from Dracula during the rape scene and the scene at the end we she approaches her baby for the first time) or more suitable actors. Maybe it's the script that is lacking. I think the psychological element should have been handled better, making the ambiguity (of whether this is real or all in her head) a lot more prominent for Rosemary and for the viewers.<br/><br/>IMO, the best thing in the movie is Ruth Gordon, who does an excellent job as Minnie, the old neighbor (and won an Oscar for it)."

","I must have been a teenager when I saw this one for the first time. I remember it made quite an impression on me. Now 20 years later it still manages to do so. The movie takes a long time to build-up. It isn't gruesome in your face horror, much more psychological. The devil scene (obviously the most horror of the whole movie) I think is very well done, unsettling just like Rosemary (wonderfully portrayed by Mia Farrow) being put on drugs and slowly feeling how she is alone in her fight against those witches or satanists whatever you want to call them. Despite its slow pace the movie never bores me as I think every scene has its importance. There really isn't a scene thrown in to entertain or to regain the focus of people who might been dozing of. What I also like about these older movies is looking at it in its time period. What did they have back than what they don't have now any more and vice versa. It's a nice trip back into the time, a piece of history. Granted the ending was a bit silly with the photographing Asian guy (a bit stereotypical) but that the mystery remains of what the baby looks like is certainly a good thing."

","One of the all-time, classic thrillers of American cinema. It's, as many people have said in passing in regards to the film, the un-immaculate conception of the Antichrist on an innocent married woman. But the story isn't that simple. The great director, Roman Polanski, keeps you second guessing yourself the whole time. Is it all the work of witch craft? or is Rosemary just crazy? Was her visit from the devil just a dream? or did it really happen? You're left on edge, until the very end, when it all tragically makes sense. Polanski's direction is startlingly good. The dream sequence is nearly the best scene in the whole picture. It demonstrates Polanski merging his avant-garde roots within his first contemporary American film. Such creepy fun."

The movie starts slowly, and very innocuously, but you can sense the gathering momentum and evil. The final scene brings everything together, and justifies the ""horror"" tag.<br/><br/>Great performance by Mia Farrow in the lead role. John Cassavetes gives good support as Rosemary's husband.

","I wish I had of watched it sooner. I wanted to but never felt in the mood to watch an ""old, scary movie"". Eventually I just put it on. Farrows voice immediately unhinged me with the strange ""la la la la laa"" tune. This tune was even more haunting when played during the final credits. What I was expecting to see was not what I saw. I thought I had it all sussed out and thought I was in for a few jumps and creepy noises and ultimately a victory in the end. Eh, no. The music had me on edge throughout, I felt wary of any music at all throughout the film. My initial thoughts were banished as the movie progressed, however, my one critique would be that I wanted it to confuse me. I wanted to be unaware as to who was right and who was imagining the strange goings on. I knew from the start that Rosemary was right so I didn't find this film to be a psychological thriller. It was thrilling but I sort of knew what was coming after a few deaths and a smelly charm. <br/><br/>What got me up in arms was the ending, eh what?! No. Fix it. Fix it now. Make a sequel and make it all go away.... Is this where The Omen came from? Why won't these evil children go away in films. . . <br/><br/>Farrow is the face of innocence as she tries her best to keep on the right side of everyone. She tiptoes into a dark and evil downfall before she is all but lost. Her shocking deterioration in appearance is almost sickening as you desperately want to get her far away from the strange world she has stumbled upon (and get her some cake). Her desperation becomes heart wrenching as the realisation hits home that she is trapped. Completely and utterly trapped.<br/><br/>Cassavetes is completely believable as the desperate, in need of a big break actor. He has the anger and charm perfected in equal measure! When he is charming you almost believe that he is nothing more than a stressed, over-protective husband, unsure of what to do during his wife's first time expecting. Ruth Gorden is superb. She is that real old lady who lives nearby and can't help her interfering nature. Yes you want to tell her to leave but you can't, she just wants the company, you tell yourself. Her rash voice and busy body mannerisms are perfect for her nosy neighbour and devil's aid persona. Blackmer is intriguing. He could be that friendly old grandfather with the gentle demeanour who lives with his overly talkative and irritating wife in the apartment next door, or he could be the son of a witch and has the mischievous twinkle in his eye when he smiles..<br/><br/>I wanted slightly more of a psychological maze but I got more than I bargained for so a 8.2 would be fitting for Polinski's great adaption."

","If I had to pick a horror flick that perfectly captures that disturbing feeling of paranoia, then 'Rosemary's Baby' would be a perfect example. It's the type of paranoia of which things are not really what they seem or if you're just thinking way in over your head by creating this make-believe scenario.<br/><br/>What I love about this film is that it perfectly captures this despondent atmosphere as the story progresses with the subtle nuances of the music, but to me, I think it mostly boils down to Mia Farrow's performance of Rosemary Woodhouse. She consistently conveys that paranoid feeling and you can feel her emotions when she is dealing with surroundings that are progressively provoking her suspicions, based on her perceptions.<br/><br/>And that is basically where the 'horror' of the movie comes from which is the mood and it takes a lot of work just to use that as the only source of causing a feeling of dread in the viewer. It perfectly falls in line with the New Hollywood genre in that it relies on subtle nuances instead of huge melodrama, surprisingly creating something that is far more effective than your average blockbuster affair. There's only some disturbing imagery, but as Rosemary grows more weary of the other characters, you can feel that same dread as well. Other than that, there are no special effects, cheap high volume scares, or fast paced horror, just outstanding performances, especially from Ruth Gordon.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is a work of art in that it shines in creating horror that is bare and minimal, yet surprisingly still being able to retain a strong, brooding atmosphere that pulls you in and never lets you go until the end of the movie. 5/5"

","Rosemary's Baby may have been released over 40 years ago, but I can still see why it is considered a classic horror film. For me it is definitely a classic, containing all the usual horror clichés (family moves house, hears haunted stories, woman goes crazy and runs round with a knife etc etc)but with added twists and interests, through the form of artistic dreamlike sequences that even Dali would be proud of. I think this definitely saved it from becoming boring; it was a very long film and, for me, seemed to take a while to build up to a climax, had it not been for these surreal moments pulling me back in.<br/><br/>Polanski's use of direction and editing cleverly built up the tension and foreshadowed the traumatic events ahead. He used slow tracking of the camera forward and backwards to create suspense, as well as a lot of close ups, and there was a lot of the usual high pitched tense music that no horror film would ever be the same without. I also noticed a discreet ticking noise in the background every now and then, subtly creating suspense. Every scene featured Rosemary, the title character, meaning the audience was always on her side, which I think is very clever.<br/><br/>Although I may have been 40 years late in seeing this film, I'm glad I did. Everyone loves a classic horror and I think Polanski did a fantastic job. It may be long but if you keep with it I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"

They move into the Bradford, a luxury apartment based community. While there they meet Minnie and Roman Castavet a very odd couple that wear some intriguing outfits which easily conceal their inner personalities.

","Drawing upon a feminine sense of horror, the film adopted the axiomatic horror film principle: never trust intimacy. The betrayal was conducted by Rosemary's husband in pursuing personal fame, while the completion of this Faustian Pact thoroughly destroyed the intimacy displayed from the beginning of the film. This typical element of contemporary horror/detective films was remarkable under Polanski's direction hitherto, for it directly attacked the pretension of an age of innocence, in which the feminine sensitivity of truth should not only not be deserted, but trusted by themselves. A fascinating demonstration against the cult of truthfulness and the pretense of reason."

","An hour in and the viewer is wondering when this classic horror film is going to get scary. Even the infamous dream sequence, i.e. the climax of the movie, does not instill the fear of God in the viewer the way the bathroom scene of The Shining does. But it is this covertness that makes the film so creepy. There is nothing popping out at you, nothing even obviously scary. You never see the evil nature of the coven members; in fact, they seem good-natured: always treating Rosemary with care and politeness, even when she confronts them with a knife in fist and yet they manage to steal away her first-born child. <br/><br/>It's easy to make the disconnect when monsters and murders are involved; we don't see these things on a daily basis so why relate to them? We do however see nice but annoying old people and domineering husbands with Donna Reed type wives. <br/><br/>With its element of paranoia Rosemary's Baby is the precursor to the psychological thrillers of today but without the ""twist"" ending of a character being clinically insane. Rosemary's situation is real, just as it seems, and that's what is so disturbing. We cannot write the story off as being imagined so it sits with us long after the credits. The illusion of reality never seems like a pretense, never seems like a basis of suspense but Polanski manages to deconstruct it right beneath our feet."

","""Is God dead?"" asks the cover of the Time Magazin Rosemary is holding in her hands while she's waiting for the doctor. And really, this question is the undertone of the whole film. Other reviewers mentioned the biblical references in the movie, so I don't need to get into that.<br/><br/>But what is if God's dead? Of course, Satan will rule the earth according to Mr. Polanski. The nice old couple next door is taking the holiness of the pope in question? Well of course they do, cause they are evil witches serving the Beelzebub. Because there's nothing in between, there's just black and white. If we stop believing in God and Christianity, ""Rosemary's Baby"" will show us what we get.<br/><br/>So one might call this a fundamentalist masterpiece. It's true horror not because there's gore or in my mind maddening suspense but because it deconstructs an idyll. A young couple moves in a new apartment wishing to multiply. As Polanski said himself, the film basically starts out like a Doris-Day-flick, but boy doesn't it end that way. The slow pacing, the creepy undertone behind the pretense of normality and the great acting, especially by Mrs. Gordon, make this a masterpiece that contradicts almost everything that passes as horror these days. If you notice a simple cheap effect in this, give me a call.<br/><br/>Of course there's an enormous gab between the subtle ton of the film and its loutish message. But I guess that's what effective propaganda is all about. Relucantly acknowledging 8 out of 10 stars for my money."

","'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) was master director Roman Polanski's first American film and is a thriller/horror based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. The film follows Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) as she moves into apartment 7-E in New York City with her actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes). After making friends with elderly couple Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) who also live in the building, Rosemary falls pregnant, to the delight of many. However, as Rosemary's health begins to deteriorate during pregnancy she starts to become suspicious about the actions and behaviour of those around her.<br/><br/>Staying extremely true to Ira Levin's novel, Polanski has created a slick, smart thriller that is, at times, genuinely terrifying as we follow the tale of the beautiful and perfectly cast Mia Farrow as she strives to protect her unborn child. Ruth Gordon, gives an Oscar winning performance as the nosy Minnie, and while you become more and more concerned about the safety of Rosemary as the film progresses, there are still genuine funny moments to be had, a credit to Polanski's script and Mia Farrow's timing. <br/><br/>Right now I am still debating whether to give it a 7 or 8, as there are certainly problems I have with it. Most notably I felt John Cassavetes was not as convincing as the other 3 main cast members, which lets down the story slightly as he is integral to the final scenes. I am however to give it the latter score, mostly because I saw this film having been given a full description of the film and its climax beforehand, which, undoubtedly lessened the impact. Overall, 'Rosemary's Baby' is a must-watch, as it shows how true terror can be created without the need of blood and gore, a feat that horror/thriller directors of today have struggled to achieve."

When you start to watch the movie, you may think it is like just another movies that make itself ordinary. But the scenes in the movie were successfully filmed and got me to the different thoughts in every second of it. Content of the movie is mostly related to a drama and a mystery. Rosemary and Guy who are a happy young couple look for a flat and they move into a flat that Rosemary likes. After moving into the flat, they meet their neighbors who are a old couple. Although Rosemary likes them, she has suspicious thoughts about them. After a while, one night Rosemary has a scaring dream that evil rapes her and she gets pregnant at that night.

After baby is born, they says the baby dies but it is a lie. Rosemary finds her baby in the neighbors' flat. They says her baby is the son of the evil.

","I do not have any idea about the movie but I saw Polanski's name, I think who is the best director, I say I must watch this movie.Then I watched the movie it was some times very boring and dark.It was adapted from Ira Levin's novel.Maybe it was not good adapted from novel. So what is happening in this film? Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple.They are very friendly but there is something strange things about them - the sounds that come from their apartment.Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of their relationship and especially Minnie becomes more and more annoying, especially when Rosemary says she is pregnant she recommends her another gynecologist's and mixes a herbal drink for her every day. The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant.It happens many strange things: Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner and their friend 'Pregnant women are supposed to gain, not lose weight. And when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband plotted against her and want to harm the baby. Film shows a stereotype of devil it describes scary face, dark and messy.It is also restricted my imagination.It is not horror film it is a triller movie.Roman Polanski conveys the audience the tension actually that sometimes you feel you are in the movie.After the pregnancy Rosemarry's (Mia Farrow) physical appearance changes very strangely especially when she has cut her hair..Mia Forrow performance was very good she acted perfectly lonely and deserted women.The ending is very good.I think not showing the baby is very good choice.Rosemarry's reaction is remarkable that she accepts the son of Satan and she loves him her whole life although everybody don not believe her.In conclusion this movie is worth watching."

","At first sight movie seems very ordinary and conventional, but after watching for a while, it is easily noticed that it has a very different topic. It is really an interesting movie and I watch it curiously and excitedly. At the beginning of the movie, a young couple whose names are Rosemary and Guy look for a new flat to move into and they find one which Rosemary likes very much. They move into this flat and meet their neighbors, an old couple, whose names are Roman and Minnie. Rosemary finds Minnie strange and funny and Guy gets on well with Roman, but Rosemary is little uncomfortable about their neighbors. One night, Rosemary has a different and terrifying dream, and she becomes pregnant at this night. After a while, she goes to Dr. Hill and she learns that she is pregnant. Rosemary and Guy share this news with Roman and Minnie, and they recommend a different doctor who is their friend and very famous. Her new doctor does not give her vitamins and pills, and instead of these he says she should drink a mixture which is prepared by Minnie. Rosemary has pain and Dr. Sapirstein always says it disappears coming soon. Later, thanks to her friend, Hutch, she realizes that some things do not go right, and she starts to research. After researches, she realizes that her husband makes a deal with witches and he will give their baby to them. She tries to escape, but Guy and Dr. Sapirstein find her and take her home. After baby is born, they tell her that baby dies, but she does not believe them and finds her baby in Roman and Minnie's flat. She looks baby, and his eyes are very different. Witches say he is son of devil, and she sits and starts to cry. At the end of the movie, when baby starts to cry, she cannot wait for his crying and gets near to baby. This is really different and effective horror movie. It has a mystic topic, and I advise it everybody loving watching different and impressive movies."

","The song at the beginning of the movie evidences that something mysterious will happen, but not frightening. Therefore, I do not agree with the statement that ıt is a horror movie. And also I found the acting a bit lacking for such a scenario. Even though the plot includes many emotions and thoughts, some parts, requiring a bit greater acting, is a kind of failure.<br/><br/>No matter how many faults the movie has, the fiction is still one of the best. If you do not have any information about the film, you can expect a movie depicting a happy family with their baby. And when I started to watch it, I also expected something more normal. But during the movie, the clues help you to figure out what will happen. The house, the old couple, being blind of Guy's colleague, the death of old couples daughter, their friend's (Hutch) death, and then some troubles even a pregnancy may not include These are the clues that help us to find out what will happen. <br/><br/>A statement like ""even though it was made in 1968,... "" is only an excuse.It is because humankind is always the same humankind. All the people have been sharing the same feelings for ages. So the movie is very successful in portraying anxiety, suspect, duplicity, mercy, and many more. You can be mixed up with your ideas, for example, you can think Rosemary is really getting mad, and she is just making up absurd stories, or you can really be aware of everything and whisper ""Rosemary! Hutch is right."" or ""Poor Hutch, he couldn't tell everything, if so happened, Rosemary would be free now."" Yes, the movie urges us to think like that. As I said before, the movie is very successful in depicting, so we can even find ourselves thinking and justifying Rosemary's behavior right. Or we may find ourselves saying that even it is for an unbelievable creature, it is still maternal instinct."

","I watched Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and I think it is one of the best horror films I have ever watched. It has well organized subject that may attract anyone else watched this movie. When we look at 1960s'movies, we should put this movie apart from the others. As Rosemary's Baby's images and musics are perfect.<br/><br/>While watching the movie;I ,as a female,put myself in Rosemary's shoes. I understood her very well,because being a mother only special to women.When we think about Rosemary's husband named Guy,he sold his upcoming child for his career. He did not challenge for his wife and baby. The point that we should understand here is not to trust even your wife or husband. Guy preferred to believe in people who live in his apartment instead of his wife. I want to mention another topic about the movie,Rosemary's Baby.While watching the movie,spectators like me,notice that there is not blood that generally used in horror films.Also the film does not contain violence like the other horror films. <br/><br/>One of the most marked points in the movie is that the wicked characters of the movie are not scary face as usual.On the contrary they have kind words and a smiling face.In recent days'films have also bad characters.They can be easily realized that they are really bad.For instance; Rosemary's neighbors Minnie and Roman are seen very helpful,very kind and generous people.So they managed to affect Rosemary and especially his husband,Guy.Guy believed them easily but not Rosemary.<br/><br/>To sum up, the film is very nice as a whole.However I expected the ending a bit different from the real.I was not shocked because the film did not finished as I supposed to.The film should shock the viewers at the ending part as they want to know whether all these things is genuine or just a Rosemary's dream. I recommend this movie to be watched by everyone. It has its'own history."

","First of all I should say that I don't like horror movies because they always give me horrible nightmares. That is why I usually avoid from watching horror movies. However this time I had to watch Rosemary's Baby because we watched it at the school for listening and pronunciation lesson. I shut my eyes at some scenes and my instructor blurred one scene. However I was able to watch most of the movie and I found it nice, to my surprise. While we were watching the movie, one of my friends said that she had read the book of the movie but the ending was different from what she said us. It made the end surprising for me although the plot was predictable.<br/><br/>According to my opinion this movie is about the unreliability of people and that the true self of people is how different from their appearance. Although I have met with similar plots before, I found the plot creative and intriguing. The ending was sudden and weird. I think I expected a different ending, maybe something is more usual. I found the acting successful especially Ruth Gordon's. In my opinion she deserved the Oscar which she was given. I think I am going to remember Mia Farrow's desperate face for a long time.<br/><br/>The music was good in a way that frightened me who prefer to watch movies while the sound is off and read the subtitles. Especially the lullaby which plays at the beginning and end of the movie made me think that something bad and mysterious was going to happen in this movie. I also liked the poster which was suitable for the atmosphere of the movie.

","Rosemary's baby is definitely a movie that fits in my list of 'good movies'. Even though horror and mystery are not my favorite genres. And I don't like open or semi-open endings.<br/><br/>The actors did well. Most of the time, I don't like the acting in old movies. Because it just looks fake to me. But in this movie I could follow the acting very well. The lead role was portrayed by Mia Farrow. I have to say that I don't like this type of women in real life. This is my personal opinion, of course. Her way of communicating with others is so childlike. But I guess that was the role she played. She was a fragile woman. She almost never left her apartment, and when she did, she looked very vulnerable.<br/><br/>The old neighbors were played by some good actors. Their behavior was very stereotype. But I can appreciate it. It was fun to compare them to my own grandparents. The little quarrels they had and the habit of giving a lot of food to people and visitors.<br/><br/>The plot was well thought of! It was always a bit mysterious and there was that certain tension that you get when watching horror movies. You can feel that Polanski, who made the film, has a dark kind of humor. There is a lot of cynicism in the movie and also paranoia is a very important aspect. Not that it would be wrong to be paranoid in Rosemary's situation.<br/><br/>The movie gives a good view of the lessening popularity of the church during the sixties. Not much people really believed in the church. Rosemary was one of the few people who kept loyal to the church and to God. This makes a big contrast with her husband and the neighbors, who make jokes about the pope.<br/><br/>At first I thought the movie was non-fiction. I thought that the neighbors were just part of a sect that believed in Satan. I was really surprised that it was fiction after all. Especially at the very end. But even then, in a certain way you can still look at it as non-fiction.<br/><br/>The scenes in the movie were chosen very well. There was variation in locations, different kinds of light, and movie techniques This makes everything a lot more interesting. Also the music suited the movie, which is very important, especially for horror and mystery. Music or the absence of it makes a big difference in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I can conclude that this movie is worth to be seen. Even if this genre is not your style. It is definitely a 'must see' for cultural enrichment."

","İt's very interesting film, with its topic and events acted in movie. Also, the acting efficiency of actors is perfect. While watching this work, I easily imagined myself in the screenplay, I felt pessimistic, scared and curious about the subsequent events. I think it's the result of the actors' fantastic acting performance. Furthermore; passages are prepared carefully, anyone watching movie doesn't able to predict ""what's going to be in movie"" and waits the next scene. With these aspects, Rosemary's Baby is really a successful ""drama, horror and mystery"" movie. If we talk it's another aspects, the characters in the movie are good organized so, roles are generally comprehensible. Besides, the feelings of Rosemary and Guy can easily be sensed. You can feel desperately sad as if you were the parents of the baby. Roles are generally understandable but I think some scenes can be eliminated, in these eliminative scenes I was bored and these parts can be seen as really complex scenes. Other than this complexity, movie begins in slow pace, and you start to identify the characters. After this identifying process movie becomes to be interesting and mysterious, from this part on you cannot be distracted, you totally focus on the events. During this passionately watching period, facts are started to shown and they surprise the viewer. Then, on the movie finale, all facts are clarified. I can frankly say that the ending of the film is terrific. Finally, no matter how old the film is, with its plot and all the things it makes feel it can be figured out that Rosemary's Baby is really fantastic movie. Also it is on the top 250 list of Internet Movie Database and I think it is one of the most worth watching films."

It is the differences between Rosemary's Baby and other horror films. The cast is fantastic for example Mia Farrow who play a leading role was ideal.she has got delicate beauty. She kept Rosemary's emotions and thoughts right on her face so we know what she's thinking at all times and we can actually join her emotionally in her desperate fight to save her baby from the witches.

","I've always thought that horror films work best when we aren't fed all the details. Spielberg did it in 'Jaws' - we never really saw the shark until the end, but we still held our breath as we heard John Williams' chilling score when someone was in the water. We don't have to see something in order to be frightened of it. Don't get me wrong - I love a good slasher film, but they don't affect me as much as psychological horror films. In most slasher films, we get used to the killer's technique; we know when they are about to claim another victim. A film like 'Rosemary's Baby' shows us that murders aren't necessary to provoke fear from an audience. Rather, we learn that mystery is the source of fear: the things that we can't see, or don't know about.<br/><br/>Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young couple who move into a New York apartment building, with plans to start a family. Their neighbours are Minnie and Roman Castevet, an elderly couple who are strangely fascinated by Rosemary and Guy. They are nosy and a bit stubborn, however they seem like very kind and generous people on the whole. They are not without their eccentricities; for example, Minnie gives Rosemary a 'charm necklace', which contains a mysterious herb known as 'tannis root'.<br/><br/>After Rosemary falls pregnant, the film takes a rather ominous turn. Rosemary unusually loses some weight, experiences sharp pains in her abdomen and develops a taste for raw meat. It becomes clear that Guy and Rosemary are having some marriage problems, and we are led to believe that this is because Guy is struggling with his career as an actor. The Castevets become increasingly concerned with the progress of Rosemary's pregnancy. There is an extremely disturbing rape scene which occurs within a dream, whereby it looks like Polanski experimented with surrealism, as if he filmed a scene out of a Dali painting, and added his own sinister touches to it .<br/><br/>Polanski does an outstanding job at creating an uneasy atmosphere for the audience. Rosemary's complexion becomes rather pale, as does the film's colour palette. Rosemary no longer wears the bright, pretty dresses she wore before her pregnancy; instead she begins to wear a lot more light blues, whites, greys and browns. One of the most effective devices in a horror film is the 'Me versus the rest' storyline. That is, when one character believes in something, but practically every other character in the film thinks that they are delusional, even though these characters are well-aware of the truth, and are all conspiring against the lone person. A common convention of this plot device is the 'false friend' - the person who you think is there to help the lone person, but is actually 'all in on the act'. Another convention of the device is the 'glimmer of hope' character - the one person who listens to the lone person, who finds some truth in what they are saying, and is of some assistance to the person. Usually, this person will meet some sort of fate throughout the film. 'Rosemary's Baby' is a 'Me versus the rest' film, however not from the beginning, but after Rosemary falls pregnant. Mia Farrow's performance is outstanding. We see a lot of films about the trials and tribulations of motherhood, but not as many about the up-and-down process of pregnancy. Rosemary becomes Polanski's plaything once she falls pregnant. Even as a male, I felt as if I WAS Rosemary, as if I was going through the same harrowing experience as she was. We witness her decline from a beautiful housewife to a paranoid and lonely house...(we begin to get the impression that she isn't married, even though she is).<br/><br/>I didn't give this film 10/10, as I thought the ending could have been so much better. The payoff will either shock you, or be exactly as you expected, depending on how you follow the film. I just thought that such a chilling atmosphere was built up, only to be let down by an ending which had me confused over whether I should fear for Rosemary, or whether I should have one big laugh. The film ultimately preaches that a mother's love for her child is unconditional. I admire Polanski for expressing that message in such a daring way. In essence, 'Rosemary's Baby' works because every character is used to their fullest potential, and they don't look like they know they're in a movie. The film plays on our innate fear of the unknown, and doesn't rely on blood and guts or special effects, but rather on a young woman who is fearing for her own wellbeing, as well as that of her unborn child."
"Eternality","8","0","0","14 July 2010"," The best aspect of Polanski's film is that it is plausible enough to be taken seriously.
","Lured to America to direct the screen version of Rosemary's Baby, a novel by Ira Levin, Roman Polanski took the opportunity to launch himself as a star director in Hollywood. Famous in Europe for his thrillers such as Knife in the Water (1962), Repulsion (1965), and Cul-de-sac (1966), Polanski's work in Rosemary's Baby is hailed by critics as pitch-perfect. The film is also consistently mentioned as ""one of the scariest horror films of all-time"" and ""a horror classic"" by film magazines and polls.<br/><br/>Now, I am not quite favorable with these lavish praises on a film I would classify as a psychological drama rather than horror (in the purest sense of the word). But really, what is horror? What makes a film ""horrific""? Is it scares that make you jump? Or is it the dreadful atmosphere of suspense? Or is it a conceptual idea that chills you? Are these definitions so subjective that it is only right to discount them? Or are they distinct parts that describe an increasingly vague genre?<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) who lives with her husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), in a newly bought apartment flat. Guy is a struggling television actor who, to the delight of Rosemary, finally wants a baby. They have an old couple for neighbors who are caring and generous, but their actions become more suspicious over time. Soon, a pregnant Rosemary starts to hallucinate, feels pain in her abdomen, and begins to suspect a cultish plot against her baby, or does she not? <br/><br/>The ""horror"" comes from elements of Satanism and witchcraft. In a dream sequence halfway into the film, Polanski employs surrealistic images of what I would describe as the ritual raping of the protagonist by the Devil. In the final act, which I will not reveal in its entirety, Satan is hailed. However, it is important to note that Polanski's film is not a ""glorification of evil"", but an inquiry into a person's psychological well-being and self-awareness.<br/><br/>Polanski's fine direction allows the film to grow in psychological creepiness, and he does a steady balancing act attempting to suggest supernaturalism while retaining a strong sense of reality. Perhaps the best aspect of Rosemary's Baby, apart from the very faithful adaptation of its source material, is that the film is plausible enough to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>The all-round excellent acting by the cast plays a large part in creating believable characters. Farrow, especially, gives us a character whose fears we can relate to. We are with her till the very end, to that famous and ambiguous last scene of her rocking the cradle. What lies inside the cradle is clearly the stuff of nightmares, but Polanski refuses to give us the money shot – the devil baby – which makes it all the more ""scarier"" by leaving it to our imagination.<br/><br/>Generally, Rosemary's Baby is a decent film. But moments of cinematic brilliance that we have come to associate with a skillful director like Polanski are few. I find something lacking overall, of which I can't quite pinpoint. Perhaps it didn't live up to my expectations of a ""horror masterpiece"". Or maybe the feeling of satisfaction was replaced by a sense of queasiness I felt towards its ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Rosemary's Baby is good but not great. For some reason, it didn't ""haunt"" me as much as it did for many others.<br/><br/>SCORE: 7.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","At first glance, as a young child I was intrigued by this movie. I had no idea what it was about and by the time I had turned 18 years old, I took great pleasure by buying this movie and watching it for the first time. I must say, I am very impressed by it. Indeed, the film can be a bit slow in some areas. For example, when Rosemary and Guy first move in, you sit waiting, eager for the drama to continue whilst they sit silently eating their dinner. Also, the audience might find the progressing pregnancy in the film to be quite tedious, however, the building tension in the drama was very well done. The rape scene was iconic, however when Rosemary cried, ""This isn't a dream, this is really happening!"", I couldn't help but feel disappointed by her reaction to being raped; not a reaction we would normally have should we be raped by a demon. The ending, however, was worth the wait. The climax in Rosemary's line ""What have you done to him, you man-n-i-i-i-ia-cs?!"", was phenomenal, and even I felt the confession of the baby to be the spawn of the devil to be very shocking. It was absolutely brilliant! When I heard that Michael Bay was considering doing a re-make for this movie, I felt horrified. Indeed, I am very much looking forward to his adaption of 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', but has Bay adapted old horror movies in a very dangerous way? I did love his version of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', but the re-make of 'Friday The 13th' was a huge disappointment. It is like asking a director to create a re-make of 'Pulp Fiction'; it just can't be done. So, Michael Bay, it is great that you are trying to regain the hearts of millions of horror fans to creating re-makes of classic horror films, but I think 'Rosemary's baby' is one horror film you can do without adapting, for it is too professional and brilliant to be tampered with. Again, it was a brilliant film which does explore the genre of psychological horror in many aspects, this is truly a horror film for horror fans anywhere"

The right moment came at last and I finally watched Rosemary's Baby which to my surprise was a delightful one.<br/><br/>I don't consider it a horror specially that I am a huge horror fan but it is definitely a good movie that has to be seen. However, it should be seen way before you have seen The Omen, It's Alive, Grace, and all the movies that came within this same line. Trust me you will be bored if you have seen all these movies and then you do Rosemary's baby unless you paid attention to the smart details inside this movie. The casting of the old neighbors is just brilliant. For me, they're the best element in this movie. The first time Rosemary and her husband are invited to the old couple apartment for dinner, I wondered how would I have reacted if I were in there shoes trying to eat that disgusting food cooked by that old lady... it surely needed lots of guts.<br/><br/>The movie is an enjoyable experience because it's original."

Nothing particular horrifying so far. But the scene that I see Rosemary baby being known by is the hallucination part. The first scene that makes you feel uncomfortable. No doubt is this the best hallucination I've seen so far in any film. It was chilling and eerie. Not once do you believe Rosemary is safe. Polanski creates the perfect atmosphere. Just like Rosemary, you feel trapped and surrounded by monsters all the way through the film.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Mia is brilliant as Rosemary and Cassavetes plays the perfect husband. But its Ruth Gordon who shines. At first I found here rather annoying but as the film progresses you come to accept here and enjoy here character , who always liven up the scenes .<br/><br/>Even though the film is great is watch , it can come tedious and slow .

"paul2001sw-1","8","0","0","26 August 2009"," Timeless horror
","Roman Polanski arrived in America with 'Rosemary's Baby', a classic horror (about a woman who fears that a satanic cabal want to steal her as yet unborn child) that relies on no special effects but entirely on the mood of paranoia and suspense it manages to create. The idea of pregnancy as a time of special helplessness is skillfully exploited; the brilliance of the piece is that it avoids commitment as to whether anything supernatural is actually happening. In places, the 1960s-ness of it all makes it a bit hard to watch, but one really only notices this in the scenes that are filler; when the tension rises, the feeling is timeless. Mia Farrow does well as the eponymous ingénue, and while some of the other actors are more wooden (another fine director, John Cassavettes, plays her husband, yet his acting feels as if it belongs from the 50s not the 60s), but it doesn't really matter, so masterfully does Polanski turn the screw. It's an irony that Polanski's wife subsequently died at the hands of a cult; Polanski himself returned, much less convincingly, to Satanic themes with his lame movie of 'The Ninth Gate'."

","Pregnancy and eventually the bond between mother and child is a powerful thing. Hormones, attachment, sometimes postpartum depression -- even the mystery of what's growing inside -- Roman Polanski channels all these things into storytelling elements of suspense and paranoia in his superbly written ""Rosemary's Baby.""<br/><br/>Played by a 22-year-old Mia Farrow, Rosemary is the young wife of a struggling actor (John Cassavetes) who moves into a new apartment house in New York next to some strange old nosy neighbors, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer). Under strange circumstances she becomes pregnant and starts to believe there might be some conspiracy surrounding her baby.<br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" is not really a horror movie. There are no frightful images, only the illusion that you might see one, which is Polanski's best trick. Its chock-full of suspense and creates the helpless feeling of not knowing what to believe half the time. The French-born and currently exiled director delivers his first big hit with this plodding script that is never too challenging but takes hold of its audience.<br/><br/>Farrow as Rosemary is this wonderfully cheery and naive spirit who we see crumble before our eyes as her intuition and gullibility are at odds with each other. She does the first half- Rosemary quite well but shows some room for improvement in the more dramatic half of the film. Ruth Gordon is an effectively irritating scene-stealer, helping build Polanski's slow dramatic momentum by arousing our suspicions early.<br/><br/>It's not altogether poignant other than underscoring this precious bond between mother and unborn baby, but the execution of suspense is second to very few other films of its kind."

However, when Rosemary (Mia Farrow) becomes pregnant and things do not go smoothly she begins to suspect that there may be an evil conspiracy at work.<br/><br/>The cast is a pretty good one, including Ruth Gordon in an Oscar-winning supporting role. Personally, I thought that Mia Farrow delivered the best performance and was an inspired choice for the role of Rosemary. The rest of the cast is solid but not really worth remarking upon.<br/><br/>Polanski's script sticks pretty closely to the novel both in terms of plot and dialogue. I would have rather had some variation from the novel but I'm sure that others will appreciate the script's faithfulness to the source material. Polanski's direction is ably handled as well though I wouldn't hold this film alongside later efforts like ""Chinatown"" & ""The Pianist"". I also have to admit that the score (by Krzysztof Komeda) is memorable, though it isn't quite to my tastes.<br/><br/>All in all, I think that this is undeniably a worthwhile horror film but I don't agree with the current top 250 rating.

","A great Polanski film, especially for his first American one. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a classic movie for the genre, and has created a story for horror movies to leech from for decades. Mia Farrow is outstanding in her performance as Rosemary, seeming completely genuine in the role; the film is ripe with great supporting cast members. Eerie music that rises and falls with the scenes creates a perfect tension that fills out the 'scary' aspects when nothing truly frightening is happening; a great touch that keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the piece. A fan of the genre may not appreciate the film as much because of a lack of true gore, which seems to be all too common in movies now, but the way that ""Rosemary's Baby"" was shot is well-crafted, and well-suited to horror; Polanski helps add himself to a list of horror fore-fathers with this one."

This movie's different, I watched it alone and it touched me eerily.  I've been told when you have a baby, some women grow so attached to their lump they never want it to be born.  Can you imagine figuring out that the being inside is evil, before it has said or done anything.  That it belongs to that biblical monstrosity you hear about everyday?  I couldn't, I've tried, but it is basically impossible to fit into those shoes.  Rosemary is having a baby, one great milestone in your life.  She and her husband Guy move into a beautiful apartment and she just befriended the neighbour girl.  The neighbour girl commits suicide a few days later.  She has a strange nightmare about being molested by a beast, and the neighbours who were taking care of her friend are visiting daily, dropping off special herbs to eat while she is pregnant.  During her pregnancy, she starts to get suspicious of the helping neighbours, she hears them chanting at night, Guy is always next door and she is getting unbearable pains everyday.

","Rosemary's Baby stands as possibly the best suspense/horror films of all time and is frequently referred to as such for good reason.  Director Roman Polanski clearly knows his audience and how to keep us entertained as he artfully transforms Ira Levin's novel without missing a beat.  The scenes are brief and to-the-point which keeps the pace enjoyably taught.  Mia Farrow was ideal for the role of the young and gentle Rosemary Woodhouse; in fact, I can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  John Cassavettes is also phenomenal as Guy Woodhouse, the impetuous struggling actor who becomes willing to undertake desperate measures in order to save his waning career. Of course, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer turn in stellar performances as the nosy neighbors who are actually more imposing than Rosemary initially suspects.<br/><br/>Set in Manhattan, the movie has a very realistic base that fares well with the enigmatic witchcraft elements that gradually creep out of the woodwork. Polanski invites us into a believable situation involving a likeable young couple.  We can all identify with the process of choosing a new apartment, putting up with annoying neighbors, coping with career related stress, and the prospect of bringing a child into the world.  Rosemary is not the typical helpless idiot prevalent in many of today's horror films, but is, instead, headstrong and determined not to succumb to her surroundings, even as they become overwhelming.  We can see ourselves in her situation and feel for her as she is made to feel isolated.  The supporting cast is also highly talented."

Moreover, Polanski leaves it up to the viewer to decide if the grim events in the story are indeed actually happening or all some kind of nightmarish hallucination caused by Rosemary's mounting paranoia and troubled state of mind. In fact, what makes this film so chilling and unsettling are that the bulk of things which occur in the narrative are within the realm of possibility as well as the devastating revelation that Guy was willing to betray Rosemary by making an unholy pact with the devil in exchange for achieving the success that he desperately yearns for.<br/><br/>Ruth Gordon won a well-deserved Oscar for her delightfully quirky and vibrant portrayal of the flaky and pesky Minnie Castevet. The rest of the cast are just as splendid: Sidney Blackmer as the dapper Roman, Maurice Evans as the amiable Hutch, Ralph Bellamy as the avuncular Dr. Sapirstein, Victoria Vetri as the ill-fated Terry, Patsy Kelly as the kooky Laura-Louise, Elisha Cook Jr. as glum realtor Mr. Nicklas, and Charles Grodin as the unhelpful Dr. Hill.

Shortly after this Rosemary is informed that she is pregnant, both her & Guy are over joyed. But the Castevet's still show an unhealthy interest in Rosemary & her baby, they persuade Guy to make Rosemary see a different Doctor, Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy), make Rosemary drink all sorts of strange stuff & control her entire life.

The script by Polanski based on the novel by Ira Levin of the same name is a little slow & I found my patience wearing a bit thin at times but I must admit Rosemary's Baby is quite gripping & involving, it's a film which rewards patience & the effort it takes to watch it properly. Rosemary's Baby is a complex film that requires thought on the part of the viewer to fully appreciate it, otherwise it will just come across a boring overlong film with no explosions, swearing or special effects. The detailed & intricate screenplay builds the characters up nicely which is essential because we, the viewer that is, need to have some sort of emotional attachment to them for the films climax to be successful in the way Polanski intended. While the pace of Rosemary's Baby is undoubtedly slow it never lapses into boredom as we witness & experience Rosemary's paranoia grow as the film progresses, it is consistently interesting & provides good solid thoughtful entertainment. There is no gore in Rosemary's Baby except a bloody head but it's a film which doesn't need cheap gore effects to hold it's audience, it uses good storytelling instead. There is some nudity too, but not much. Technically Rosemary's Baby is very good, it has dated a bit but nowhere near as much as you might expect a film from 1968 to have. The cinematography by William A. Fraker is solid & does a good job of capturing the streets of New York & the creepy apartment block, Polanski's direction is tight, effective & accomplished throughout. The acting is very strong by all of the cast with Farrow being a particular stand-out as she suffer's a spiral descent into her own personal hell. Overall I liked Rosemary's Baby as a one time watch, it was interesting & provided one of the most famous ending in horror film history which doesn't disappoint as it hits all the right notes. Having said that at well over the two hour mark I won't be in any hurry to watch it again, ever probably as it's a little too slow for my tastes & especially since I know what's going to happen. A good film if your prepared to put the time & effort in but maybe not quite the classic many make out. Definitely worth watching particularly since it probably turns up on TV a lot & can be brought dirt cheap on DVD these days."
"LoveCoates","6","3","9","29 October 2001"," Superlative nail-biter marred by gutless ending.
","Viscerally, this is a stunning film. The New York interiors are beautifully-rendered, and both Polanski's cast is to be thanked for breathing life into his own tepid script. This movie is not for impatient. It moves very slow, but if one pays attention to the various plot details, it will have you biting your nails throughout. Rosemary's Baby reels you in almost from the very beginning and sets you squarely on the side of the protagonist, the beautiful Mia Farrow in a very believable, subtle performance. There is great dramatic irony in the horror's complex discovery plot -- you find yourself almost screaming at the film because Rosemary is too naive and charmingly honest to suspect what the audience has already gathered: that there are terrible forces and terrible people out to get her.<br/><br/>The very fact that you root so hard for Rosemary -- and believe so much in her integrity -- makes the film's ludicrously-scripted and childishly-shot ending all the more trite and hard to follow. I won't give it away, it's too silly for anything but the actual experience, but suffice it to say that whether or not you agree with the decisions that are made, they are a hard pill to swallow. Of course, it's only Polanksi manipulating his audience even more, like he does throughout the movies early hours. Like I wrote, you have to see the ending to (un)believe it: it does not taste good.<br/><br/>I have reserved the highest praise, though, for a trio of superlative performances. First, there is Ralph Bellamy in a tiny role; however, what he demonstrates is a firm grasp on the craft. In his few minutes of screen time, he manages to be sinister while seemingly doing nothing. In fact, Polanski admitted that his favorite scene in the whole movie is Bellamy retrieving Farrow from an office later on in the film. With only a few lines, Bellamy reveals his power as an actor.<br/><br/>Secondly, there is Farrow, who deserved all the raves. Against the hopelessly miscast Cassavettes as her husband, Farrow's performance is a tour de force without the force -- she does all her acting quietly. She is so beautiful, so fragile and so earnest that it no wonder how quickly you fall in love with her. I doubt very much that any other actress could have pulled this one off, and if there are ones which could have it's a testament to Farrow's performance that you still can't picture anyone else as Rosemary.<br/><br/>This is movie is not over-the-top (until it's end). If you want a bloody slasher film, you should not rent this one. It is an intelligent, suspenseful thriller. Were it not for the incredible ending, this one would have been an easy 9/10."

I didn't understand in the beginning of the movie.There is a newly couple in the movie. Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse move to a new apartment. Their neighbors are Roman and Minnie Castevet, an elderly couple. Although they are very friendly, there is something strange about them - the sounds that come from their apartment, the fact they remove all the pictures from their walls when the Woodhouses visit and other things like that. While Rosemary tries to keep a certain distance from them, Guy is very fond of the relationship to his new neighbors, and especially Minnie becomes more and more obtrusive, especially when Rosemary finds out she's pregnant - she recommends her another (better, as she says) gynecologist's and mixes a (healthy, as she says) herbal drink for her every day.<br/><br/>The pregnancy, however, develops rather unpleasant.But this pregnancy was not normal.Rosemary keeps feeling pain in her stomach and she becomes thinner, and when the pain doesn't stop after several months, she begins to believe that her neighbors, her gynecologist's and even her husband conspired against her and want to harm the baby she's carrying.She was so thin and weak. There was not ordinary actions in this situation. Then it is understood that witches prepared a plan for poor Rosemary and they deceived her husband. This movie was a different movie as always. In fact i don't like these movies .. about witches, satanists. So i didn't appreciated it. Maybe it can be ended in a different way.It can be ended with nice, happy ending.

"MOscarbradley","9","2","5","7 August 2007"," The Devil you know ...
","Ira Levin's novel about a girl impregnated by the Devil may have been a cut or two above the usual 'schlock-horror' fiction of the day but it was hardly to be taken seriously. When Roman Polanski set his cap on it he was already established as an 'art-house' director with a strong critical following. It may have seemed like dumbing down. Of course, as I've often said, hindsight is a wonderful thing and knowing what we know now of Polanski's ability to skip fairly effortlessly between genres and to make movies of artistic merit as well as appealing to a wider audience, we ought not to have been too worried. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a cracker.<br/><br/>It's the story of a susceptible young bride with an active imagination, (some might say, over-active), married to a struggling actor who, to anybody should be instantly recognizable as something of a sleaze-ball, (John Cassavetes fitting the part perfectly). They move into one of those large brownstone buildings in New York where they quickly make friends with the nice, if a trifle interfering, old couple across the hall. Soon Rosemary is finding out all about her building from her old friend Hutch who has. perhaps, an unhealthy interest in the occult. It seems that a coven of devil-worshipers once lived there and her nice old neighbours, Roman and Minnie Castevet, may still be carrying on the practice.<br/><br/>Before you can say Beelzebub, Rosemary's husband Guy has sold his soul to Satan and is helping to hold his drugged wife down while someone or something large and scaly is mounting her. Soon Rosemary is about to have Rosemary's baby, (well, Rosemary's and the Devil's), and naturally, considering who or what is inside her, the pregnancy doesn't go according to plan. Rosemary starts to fear for her health and the health of her baby, (well, she was drugged at the time; how the hell does she know who the father is!). She also starts to put two and two together and comes up with the notion that Roman and Minnie and their band of witches and warlocks want her, as yet unborn, baby as some kind of human sacrifice. Little does she know! So far so 'schlock-horror', (subsequent movies cashed in on the theme with a lot less subtlety), but Polanski stuck to the old adage that what is truly terrifying is what is left to our imagination. With the exception of the conception we never actually see the demon, (and even there only glimpsed, only suggestively). And when finally Rosemary does give birth, the monster is shielded from our gaze.<br/><br/>The movie also plays beautifully with another kind of fear, that of any expectant mother for the safety of her unborn child. Had Polanski not chosen to show the drug-rape we might have gone along with the theory that everything that was happening to Rosemary was a figment of that over-ripe imagination. Indeed there were times when you thought that maybe everything was, that Polanski was going to pull the rug from under us and tell us it was all a bad dream. Instead he serves up a different ending, one that is all the more disturbing, (and one which posits a game of 'what if's ...).<br/><br/>As Rosemary, Mia Farrow, (at the time mostly untried on the big screen, a gamine-like elf of a creature), is terrific. She is so good at getting inside the character of Rosemary, with her mounting hysteria and her physical deterioration, that you begin to fear for the actress herself. At times Farrow seems to be taking method acting a tad too far. As if to counter the 'realism' of Farrow's performance, Ruth Gordon is gloriously over-the-top as Minnie, the old witch next door. Gordon knows she has the part of a lifetime and she milks it for all it's worth, (listen to how she makes Lipton's tea sound like the most sinister drink in the world). Gordon won an Oscar for her performance and richly deserved it; (Farrow failed to get a nomination).<br/><br/>The movie itself was very successful and it opened the floodgates for so many inferior movies on the same theme that its own reputation has tended to suffer. It isn't the best film Polanski has made and in the end it never quite goes deep enough but it's a good frightener and a deliciously dark comedy with one of the best performances of the sixties and that's good enough for me."
"freaky_dave","9","2","5","13 August 2006"," For 1968, this movie is a riveting shocker
","In reviewing Rosemary's Baby, a movie that pretty much led to movies like The Exorcist, I have to think back to the year it was released. And upon realizing this, I must say that Rosemary's Baby is a horror movie in the psychological sense. There is no gore whatsoever, but none of that makes this film any less a horror movie.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure todays generation of horror movie goers would be able to watch a movie like Rosemary's Baby. It moves very slow and builds tension subtly, leading to the horrifying climax. There are a few shocking scenes, but nothing that would sicken anybody. Today's generation of horror movie buffs might even find Rosemary's Baby to be rather boring, but then things have changed since 1968. You do not have the same audience in 2006 that you had back then. But in watching movies, particularly horror films, for years, I can accept the horrors that Rosemary's Baby brings to the table.<br/><br/>Director Roman Polanski directs this movie perfectly and gets incredible performances from his cast, especially Mia Farrow (Rosemary) and Ruth Gordon (Minnie Castavet). From the beginning, this film starts with a gnawing horror that slowly builds throughout, leading to the surprising ending. It is the acting by all the participants as well as clever direction that makes all of this work wonderfully, and like I said above, it does not use gore at all to get its point across.<br/><br/>I see that I have not summarize the plot, but if I did, I believe it would only lessen some of the movie's surprises. Let's just say that if you are a horror movie buff, and enjoy slow build-up in your horror movies which leads to a surprising conclusion, then Rosemary's Baby is the movie for you. As I've emphasized above, this film has no explicit gore whatsoever. There are some mild violent scenes but nothing that would gross anybody out. You've got to realize this movie was released in the late 60s, and that was five years before The Exorcist. If you can accept that, and watch this movie, then maybe you will see why this movie is a cult favorite among many horror movie buffs."

","When I was a very young child (probably 4 or 5), my parents took my brother and me to the drive-in to see this film! Looking back, this was NOT a good plan, as ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the most chilling films of the 1960s and probably warped me for life! Many years later, I finally got to see the entire film. That's because when I was a kid, I hid my face during so much of the film--especially when they talked about a child of Satan--just the sort of thing to freak out a little boy or girl!! And WOW was I glad I finally got to see this one, as it wasn't nearly as scary as I'd thought and it was also an exceptionally well-written and chilling film.<br/><br/>Mia farrow and her husband, John Cassavetes, move into a strange apartment building due to the oddball residents. Some are quite welcoming and sweet and others seem like extras from the movie ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST! The more weirdness that occurs, the more Rosemary worries about staying there. A bit later, she has a weird but super-realistic dream where she's raped. Oddly, a short time later, Rosemary discovers she's pregnant! From here on, it's one wild and scary ride--with some wonderful twists and surprises that kept me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Usually, I avoid devil movies. Partly this could be because of my Baptist upbringing and partly because I think many of these films are just silly. However, this one is far from silly--being exceptionally well-written, suspenseful and designed for intelligent viewers instead of dull-witted thrill-seekers. Great direction, music, acting, etc.--this film has them all."
"shaun98","6","3","10","21 October 2002"," Doesn't live up to reputation
","*spoilers!!!*<br/><br/>Well crafted but ponderous and overlong, Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is one of the most overpraised films ever, in my opinion. Although intelligent and very well acted, it just drags on at times, especially in the midsection. I realize that the filmmakers wanted to establish a setting that was as ordinary as possible, so that the intrusion of the forces of darkness will have a greater impact on the audience. Still, I wish they had spiced things up with some more interesting bits, or at least made some judicious trims here and there. It's not an unreasonable expectation when the plot involves the devil himself raping a woman. I had a similar problem with ""The Exorcist,"" but upon reflection, the latter film is a more assured work. William Friedkin's film had done a much better job setting up the story, was more evenly paced, and boasted a much more satisfying payoff.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the final third of ""Rosemary's Baby"" is still intriguing and reasonably suspenseful. Polanski does a good job in creating a degree of ambiguity; is this poor woman really carrying Satan's child, or is she out of her mind? Of course, the former turns out to be the correct answer, but it adds a good psychological layer to the material. The dream sequence, where the dark lord imposes his will on the heroine, is genuinely disturbing. The final stalk sequence leading to the denouncement is actually quite gripping. However, I hesitate to state that these high points are worth sitting through the whole film for, especially in light of today's notoriously jaded audience. And I realize this may sound petty, but I was irritated by the vocals in the opening credits; they were so redundant.<br/><br/>As I have previously indicated, the performers usually outshine the often turgid material. Mia Farrow is highly sympathetic as the unfortunate target of hell's minions; we always root for her. John Cassavetes adds excellent support as her husband, who may or may not have an agenda of his own. Ruth Gordon turns in the funniest performance as the next-door neighbor whose motives are much more sinister than we could imagine. Her ""eccentric"" approach throws the audience off balance; surely this silly old lady can't hurt anyone...or can she? Sydney Blackmer does fine has her co-conspiring husband, whose facade of goodwill masks the darkest of intentions.<br/><br/>In the end, this may be one of these films where you need to be on some sort of ""special wavelength"" to enjoy. Many people regard this as one of the finest genre films ever made. I would like to count myself among them. Alas, I cannot. Although I am willing to admit that I just might be wrong about the whole thing, I am reluctant to ever rent it again. Not for a long time anyway. I might be off on this one, but that's a mistake I can easily live with.<br/><br/>**1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Paramount Pictures"
"zmaturin","5","4","16","27 March 2002"," Nightmarish, scary, and disgusting- and that's just the leading lady!
","ROSEMARY'S BABY is an interesting, well shot, and occasionally scary movie dominated by the icky, talent less actress Mia Farrow. Her presence taints this movie in my mind, as it does any Woody Allen movie she appears in. After her character becomes pregnant others comment on how terrible she looks and how much weight she has lost, but she look exactly the same! If she did loose any weight she'd be about the diameter of a pipe cleaner. Was there a fashion trend in the 60s where emaciated corpses with bad haircuts were all the rage? <br/><br/>There are good things in this movie, though. It's definitely the best collaboration between the producer of STRAIGHT JACKET and the director of CHINATOWN. The scene where Mia gets knocked up is nightmarish and beautiful, and the surreal ending is okay, if a little anti-climactic. Ruth Gordon puts in another great performance, joining her stellar roles in HAROLD AND MAUDE, EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, and ANY WHICH WAY YOU CAN. The woman is hilarious, and sexier than Mia Farrow. There's also able support from John Cassavetes as the jerk husband, Ralph Bellamy (best known for the Fat Boys' magnum opus DISORDERLIES) as the doctor that gives illogical advice, Maurice Evans (Dr. Zaius), the great Elisha Cook, Jr (THE KILLING), and a pre-BEETHOVEN Charles Grodin as another, more competent doctor.  Anton LaVey reportedly plays the devil! <br/><br/>As far as slow-moving devil posseson movies go, this is better than BEYOND THE DOOR but not as good as THE EXORCIST or EXORCIST III.

With Mia Farrow's great acting you could believe Rosemary character. The new neighbors of Rosemary are Satanists and rosemary's husband joins them after sometime. Rosemary finds them creepy and weird. Mia Farrow acts her character very efficiently. With her effective gestures you may be understand what is going around Rosemary. Rosemary is an innocent catholic girl who lived her entire life in a little small town. The life in a big city is very strange for Rosemary. The lullaby which is sung by Mia Farrow and the other songs of the movie are so beautiful. In the movie with these affects and some others the tension gets high. With the scenes, acting and soundtracks the movie become truly a classic horror movie. There are no cheap tricks which are useful for making movie a thriller. But in the movie there are some secrets and questions which I did not get the answers while I was watching the movie. For me even if the movie is an excellent horror example, there is a complication that the movie contains. For instance I found the ending of the movie a little bit complicated but it is a great movie to watch.

","Even though no monsters or real scare moments are present, the atmosphere and the psychological elements of this movies still makes this a strong and original horror movie. Just like the 1973 movie ""Don't Look Now"", the horror is hidden in the creepy story that keeps you guessing till the end what is truly going on and who you are to believe.<br/><br/>The movie is told in a good slow pace which makes the movie and the characters more realistic. Also the atmosphere is another element that adds to the realistic feeling of the movie. Thing I wasn't really to happy about was the editing. At times the movie jumps just from one scene to another without any 'warning'. For instance, the main characters are talking in the living room and boom, the next moment they are sitting at the dinner-table. I'm almost positive that this was done on purpose and that it was perhaps merely an experiment but it was not something I was happy about. So experiment failed in my opinion.<br/><br/>Really my favorite moments were the dream sequences. There were just like real dreams are; weird and not logical. Quite possible the most realistic dream sequences featured in a movie-history. Real kudos to Roman Polanski for the magnificent directing of this movie.<br/><br/>The actors portray their characters very realistic and are helped by the solid script and dialog. I love how they made Rosemary the only real true main character of the movie. There are not a lot of movies that focus so much on mainly the female character as this movie. Yes, of course there are enough movies where a female is the main characters but most of those movies also feature a much present male character, or other characters. This movie focuses mainly on just Rosemary, especially towards the ending when her paranoia and fear grows and she begins to feel more and more alone and helpless.<br/><br/>An highly original and unforgettable horror movie that is up there with the best movies of the '60's.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

That wouldn't be fair.

If you get it too early, you spend too much time saying, ""No, dummy, it's over there!"", which makes me feel more frustrated than scared.<br/><br/>So, while it wasn't a bad movie and kept my interest (and Ruth Goldman was amusingly dotty as the neighbor) it didn't scare me."

","I recently saw ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the theater (more on that later). As ""Rosemary's Baby"" (originally released in 1968; 136 min.) opens, we get to know a young wedded couple, Rosemary and Guy. They are apartment shopping, and are delighted to find a place in the Bramford building. Rosemary gets to know Terry, who lives on the same 7th floor with an elderly couple, Roman and Minnie. Then one day when Rosemary and Guy walk home, there is a commotion in front of their building. Turns out Terry threw herself out of the window to her death... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this film marks the US debut of Polish director Roman Polanski, and what a debut it was. Now more than a half century since its release, and viewed as a timeless classic (it is currently rated 97% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), the movie provides a classic example where less is more (""Jaws"" would follow that very same ""less is more"" approach 7 years later, with equally superb results). I did not see the movie when it came out (I was only 8 years old at that time), but I have seen it a number of times over the years, although I cannot recall how long ago most recently-meaning, it's been very long ago. Other than the crucial scene where Rosemary sees the baby for the first time, I had very little recollection of the movie (for example: the scene where Rosemary gets the book entitled ""All of Them Witches"" felt brand new to me). My reaction to seeing it again after so many years is that this is a textbook example of outstanding storytelling, aided by a wonderful cast and made cheaply ($23 million production budget in today's dollars, truly peanuts in today's Hollywood). Mia Farrow was a mere 23 when ""Rosemary's Baby"" came out, yet she easily dominates the screen. What a shock it is when about an hour into the movie Rosemary changes her hairstyle ('Viddal Sassoon!"" she notes) completely, and not for the better, I might add. John Cassavetes (as Guy), Ruth Gordon (as Minnie) and Sydney Blackmer (as Roman) are delightful. Keep an eye out for Charles Grodin (as Dr. Hill)!<br/><br/>I recently saw ""Rosemary's Baby"" in the theater for the very first time, of course the best way to experience any movie. It played three consecutive days at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati as part of the month-long ""Spooktober"" festival. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended just okay (10 people). I myself am very happy that I got to see this again, and in the theater. If you are interested in seeing one of the all-time classics of psychological thrillers, I'd readily suggest you do so (and in a theater if at all possible), and draw your own conclusion."

","From the unique setting to the unsettling lullaby-like score, there really is nothing else quite like this masterwork of suspense, dread and suspicion. Director Roman Polanski's meticulous attention to detail pays off grandly here as usual, with each frame filled with striking elements, from the skyline of New York City to the peculiar sound mixing to a majestic apartment where most of the movie takes place. The story itself slowly unfurls and becomes gradually more suspenseful and portentous as it goes along, with Mia Farrow delivering a knockout of a performance as the naive but resilient Rosemary. She's aided greatly by an Oscar-winning performance by Ruth Gordon, who makes quite an impression here as a nosy neighbor who may be part of a witch's coven. On top of all its great elements, ""Rosemary's Baby"" also functions as a remarkably faithful adaptation of Ira Levin's 1967 novel, arriving nearly intact on the big screen."

","Rosemery (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassavetes) Woodhouse have just moved into a new apartment. Life's going pretty decent for them and they are happily married. When Minnie Castavet (Ruth Gordon), their apparently friendly neighbor, starts to intrude a little to much on their privacy Rosemery, who has just gotten pregnant, starts to experience more and more unusual behaviors from the people around her and starts getting suspiciously sick.<br/><br/>That is all the plot details I will let myself reveal for this film, I know that they are incomplete, but I also know that many people still have to watch this film and since it is so crucial to go into this one truly knowing as little as possible I will limit myself in the review too, in order to leave you the pleasure of experiencing for yourself the greatest horror film ever made.<br/><br/>Almost fifty years from its release ""Rosemery's Baby"" still stands high as not only my favorite horror film, but one of the greatest films ever made, one of those that when occasionally adding up a top 20 features ever made, keeps being brought up to the top spots. This is a treasure of a film, one from which I have learned the most about filmmaking and one that I hope to convince you to watch if you haven't yet had the fortune to. This is an experience, a film that crawls into your head and body and doesn't leave you for a long time after having seen it.<br/><br/>What distinguishes this film immediately, the element that truly makes it terrifying is its theme: this film is about true horror brought to life, this film is about the terror of a mother fearing the loss of her baby before it is even born. Now from that incredibly harrowing idea, Polanski builds up a film void of any clichés or any horror tropes: there aren't jump scares, there aren't actually any scares at all; this is a film about paranoia, about madness and stress, about your life being taken away from you and that is exactly what drives your mind crazy in watching it.<br/><br/>The anxiety levels that are built up through the long takes used throughout the whole film are off charts. You feel as though weight is being put on your body and the more you go on the more pressure you feel as you struggle to shrug it off of yourself, but you just don't manage, the film keeps going on, keeps building, it even has a double climax which ticks you into thinking you are safe when in fact the whole stress and adrenaline you have built up for two hours is brought back to you in the final sequence which is as tense as I have ever been watching a film, as horrifying as anything you could experience and as surprising as you could believe.<br/><br/>All of that is not just coincidence, the craft put into this film is stunning, what Polanski managed is unrepeatable and it is the mark of a great director in his prime state. He uses constantly long wide takes to capture everything going on in Rosemery's life, for two hours you witness her growing paranoia in brilliant little ways. Polanski plays with audience expectations and messes around with traditional filmmaking efforts to make the audience grow paranoid at the same pace of Rosemery. There is just one sequence in the whole film that could be considered horror, the rest of it is just apartment life, or is it? The attention to detail here is what make the difference, the little ways the actors move, the gargantuan and brilliant performance by Ruth Gordon who drives you crazy, the little information packages that are slowly delivers to you, the incredible sound design that shows how simple horror can be and how the fear of the unknown is what drives humans mad.<br/><br/>As I said Ruth Gordon is brilliant in the film, half of the box office revenue should have gone to her for making the character of Minnie Castavet come to life in its fullest and most unsettling form. Yet all of the actors here are giving lessons into acting. Everyone of them contributes as a piece of the puzzle and once the whole picture is unveiled to you, you will appreciate their work for how glorious it is.<br/><br/>The screenplay too is something to be studied. Interestingly enough it is considered one, if not the one, script to be the closest adaptation to a book ever written. Apparently the book lent itself easily to an adaptation because on a script level too the film is just flawless. Dialogue is absolutely incredible and every single line is layered with more than what meets the ear. Moreover, the character work is pitch perfect and does not lend itself to half of a dull moment, every person in the picture is on screen for the right time and function, you manage to digest the perfect amount of information for you to understand further developments and never too much for the whole ordeal to collapse.<br/><br/>I have nothing but admiration for this film, even after multiple viewing it just keeps getting better, I keep discovering details and the paranoia I get from it just keeps growing, but don't worry, when it is all said and done what you will remember and take away from it is actually the adrenaline the film manages to fuel into your body, the experience you are given isn't worth a price it is just glorious cinema that uses the medium of visual storytelling to its full, top-most advantage and delivers one of the greatest motion pictures ever made."

So, don't expect the chilling atmosphere and the very scary scenes you find in normal horror, like the Woman in Black, Ju-on or The Changeling. These movies are really intense, eerie and frightening.<br/><br/>Rosemary's baby is not the same kind of movie. It is about the agony of a woman that planned to have a baby but got pregnant under some strange circumstances. It is a stylish movie where all the actors deliver very nice performances. The dream scenes are really, well, dream-like. They make you lose touch from reality. There is quite a mystery too but no plot twists or unpredictable turns.<br/><br/>An overall solid supernatural thriller with some disturbing elements."
"mark.waltz","8","1","2","21 October 2014"," Yes, Sir, that's Satan's Baby....
","When a movie opens with Mia Farrow singing ""La la la la"" over the credits to spooky music, you know it's going to be a strange film, and with ""Rosemary's Baby"", not only did she become a star, but the supernatural Satan worship film craze began. Yes, there were movies about devil worshipers before, but they were usually Z-grade low budget films that had little commercial release other than drive-ins and underground theaters. ""Rosemary's Baby"" was a mainstream film produced by the king of shock schlock (William Castle) and directed by the controversial Roman Polanski.<br/><br/>Finding the perfect apartment in Manhattan has been tough in any decade, but in the 1960's, it proved to be demonistic for young housewife Farrow whose out of work actor husband (John Cassavettes) literally makes a deal with the devil to insure his success. Once you find a perfect apartment in Manhattan, you also hope for perfect neighbors, ones who are friendly and helpful without being nosy. ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner!"" Katherine Hepburn says in a Turner Movie Classics montage of 100 years of film, which is immediately followed by a shot of a peephole focusing on the obviously eccentric Ruth Gordon. Minnie Castevet is one of those neighbors one dreads but can't help but not like. She's a little too helpful, always a bit too cheery, and a lot interfering, if well-meaning. But there is obviously something up with her and husband Roman (Sidney Blackmer), and it will come to a horrific discovery for Farrow, especially after a nightmare that leads to her becoming pregnant.<br/><br/>Ira Levin's best-selling novel was one of 1968's most popular movies and made a cult movie star out of the elf-like Farrow who is unlike any other movie star before or since. Even with all those classic Woody Allen films of the mid-late 1980's, this will be the film for which she will always be remembered. She's just slightly neurotic enough to be compared to the boy who cried wolf, which in this case would make her the wife who cried Satan! Nobody's going to believe that the nightmare she had was actually reality, that is except an old friend (Maurice Evans, ironically the warlock Maurice on ""Bewitched"") who finds out that his interference isn't without consequences.<br/><br/>On the side of Satan are such memorable character performers as Patsy Kelly, Hope Summers, Elisha Cook Jr., and Phil Leeds. Kelly is hysterically funny as Gordon's pal as they arrive at Farrow's apartment and start knitting up a storm for the unborn toddler. Later, she rocks the cradle as if she was churning butter, making her distaste towards Farrow obvious and childlike. The film is mostly serious, especially as Farrow meets and befriends young Victoria Vetri who meets a shocking ending. This alerts her to the dangers awaiting her, especially when she meets Gordon and Blackmer upon returning home to find a crowd in front of the apartment building on Central Park West. The suspense grows and grows, exploding into spooky consequences as Farrow tries to escape her fate. The film is guaranteed to keep the audience riveted, and the ending leaves the viewer's imagination open as to what would happen, although a rarely seen television sequel would take the story down stranger paths."
"donuthaters12","8","1","2","26 January 2014"," Not Perfect In It's Screenplay But So Much Of It Is Done Right That It Shouldn't Be Missed
","Rosemary's Baby wasn't the film that introduced me to the works of Roman Polanski but rather it was Chinatown. So I came into this with very high hopes and thinking it may even top the previous film I have watched, due to the hype and the intriguing subject matter. After watching it twice already, I can clearly say that Rosemary's Baby isn't perfect but it has a lot to offer that proves that it cannot be missed.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby was based off the novel by Ira Levin and was adapted to the screen by Roman Polanski. I haven't read the novel so I cannot say whether or not the film drives away from the source material but what Polanski has given us here is quite interesting with only minor trips that prevent this from being a perfect film. The film mainly follows through Rosemary's experience during her pregnancy and as she gets closer to the end, she also gets closer to the truth. As much as I enjoyed seeing this concept being explored, it was dragged down by the lack of incentive to keep us emotionally engaged throughout, instead all that was bottled up for the second half of the film once the tension started to build. This made the first half felt a little stretched out and at times feeling unnecessary. Polanski cleverly avoids giving any confirmation of our suspicions until the last few minutes of the film as throughout the film we follow Rosemary alone, along with her paranoia and stress, and never gives us any moment of peace from it.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is Roman Polanski's fifth film. Polanski creates his first hour of the film to feel like a play, with characters just talking to one another in a confined space and allowing the actors to completely use their surroundings in order to gain a natural performance. The last hour of the film is where things start to pick up and the horrors of the situation emerge and have us feel stressed for Rosemary. Though I thought highly in Polanski's efforts in creating the first half of the film, regardless I felt that it was quite slow and lacked a bit of a visual or mental incentive to keep us completely invested. It becomes much more enjoyable in subsequent viewings when we already know what happens to Rosemary and understand what every character's motives were.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film was handled by William A. Fraker, who later on in his career will be nominated awards for his work but for Rosemary's Baby it was under-appreciated. Which I found understandable because this film did truly feel take an amateurish style of photography, with shots only showing what it needs to show you in order to move film along. Fraker for the most part has his camera constantly moving, it is not so obvious as it only really moves because the actors are moving or are doing some action and the audience needs to see it in order for us to gain something from it. As we get closer to the end, Polanski and Fraker allows us to get closer and closer to Rosemary emotionally supported with tighter close ups and using the camera as a shadow following her wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Krzysztof Komeda is the film's composer and what he has created is hauntingly beautiful. Komeda's score rarely is in display as the film uses silence to create tension at the start and allows the dialogue more to be in display and not have us be too distracted from the actors. The lullaby chant at the beginning of the film is one of the most frightening things I have heard as it has this undertone of evil under it, but if it is just heard as the lullaby alone without the instrumental or Fraker's photography it would just sound like a mother singing to her child with no dark undertone. I wish that the film did contain more of his score as it was truly well crafted but I guess it would have interfered with Polanski's vision.<br/><br/>The film's actors truly have to work their asses off for this film, as it demands so much from them, Rosemary in particular. Mia Farrow as Rosemary Woodhouse was so great as she portrays this character who is suffering such elevated stress and who feels alone and lonely during her pregnancy even when there are people around her. Farrow makes us feel like we're the only one who is there for her. John Cassavetes was great as Guy Woodhouse. Cassavetes was able to play a man who doesn't come off at all as unlikable, even if certain events and motives may seem to fracture his character. Ruth Gordon has impressed me on a little film called Harold and Maude, and I think for Rosemary's Baby she is playing a less complex and interesting character, Minnie Castevet. Nevertheless, Gordon doesn't disappoint here with her character rambling on and on, never seeming to give Rosemary or Guy a window of opportunity to even react. Though probably faithful to the novel, I felt that her character needed a bit more for me to truly enjoy watching the character.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby may not be a perfect film in my eyes but it gets so many things right that I can't help but go back to this when I feel like watching a film that can terrify me and keep me engaged with the technical aspects of the film. The acting is, for the most part, a joy to watch and the film contains patient and subtle cinematography. Polanski has made something wonderful that should at least be given a try even if the subject matter may be too dark for some."

","Recently I have discovered a new found love for the horror genre and have been building up my collection of horror films. I had heard about Rosemarys Baby before but it was never really on the top of the list of my films to watch, however after watching it I must say I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>The film isn't the scariest of horrors but there is a feeling of impending doom from the start after Rosemary moves into her new apartment with her actor husband and is befriended by her neighbours who just don't seem quite right. What I enjoyed about this film is the fact you can sympathise with Rosemary and her feelings of isolation as she starts to realise that there is something more sinister going on and you are in suspense of what is about to happen next. <br/><br/>Warning Spoilers Ahead: I think the ending of the film is very fitting and disturbing as Rosemary walks into the room to find all the members of the cult that have come to see her baby, also the fact that you never see the babies face, yet you get to see Rosemarys shocked reaction leaves everything to the imagination. I recommend everyone especially horror fans to watch this film."
"Nothinggrandproductions","9","1","2","7 October 2013"," Constantly keeps you guessing
","Rosemary's Baby is the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and Guy (John Cassavettes), a young couple who just moved into a New York City apartment. They have two elderly neighbors who appear to be friendly but a bit too friendly, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman Castevet (Sidney Blackmer). Rosemary eventually gets pregnant after they try to and this leads to the hysteria of the film as she can't trust anyone around her. She hasn't an idea of what is going on, who has done what to her, or who's side anyone is on. It's complete confusion for her. It's hard to completely describe this film without giving things away, so that's about all I'll talk about plot wise.<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about this movie is you feel like Rosemary's character, you have no idea what the truth is, who the people around her are for sure, and up until the very end, you still aren't. The movie will make you think one way and then completely flip it the other way around. It isn't so much a horror movie as it is a psychological thriller depicting hysteria of witchcraft and what's real or isn't. And it works is the amazing part, many times films like this where they try to keep you guessing are unsuccessful where as I found this one to work nearly all of the time. <br/><br/>Sometimes though, Rosemary is much too naïve, it can be a bit much but it's a kind of a suspension of disbelief thing where it needs to be there for the plot to progress although, Mia Farrow does a good job of playing it as well as playing hysterics. The movie is well-shot especially the simple opening credits sequence with the haunting music played over it. In addition, the ending was an interesting one, it will leave you thinking, and it left me unsure of what to think but I think I liked the way it ended because it wasn't the thing I expected which made it more interesting. Overall, this is a unique film especially considering I went into it thinking it would be Exorcist/Possession esque movie but its more of smart movie about who/what to believe."
"anutara","9","1","2","27 July 2013"," The purest psychological thriller
","This movie is an amazing accomplishment - it manages to get under your skin and give you sleepless nights with almost no display of gore (there is one slightly gory scene), violence (there is one rape scene, but it is not very disturbing due to its implausibility) or pale ghosts with long hair. When the movie started, I was a bit underwhelmed because it seemed like just an ordinary drama. This was intentional I suppose - the director was shooting for a gradual build up of the feeling of dread. I wasn't prepared for how disturbing the movie would eventually get. As Rosemary's sense of paranoia and feelings of despair increased, I found myself empathizing with her. The tragic culmination was absolutely perfectly done, and I felt a sense hopelessness for Rosemary's situation, almost like she was a family member or a close friend. Not many psychological thrillers / horror movies have had this effect on me, and for this reason, I highly recommend it to people who are looking for horror movies that deliver more than just a few scares."
"kenjha","8","1","2","8 June 2013"," Atmospheric Thriller
","A young couple moves into a New York City apartment, where strange things start happening. Making his first American film, Polanski expertly creates a suspenseful atmosphere where tension builds slowly but surely in this influential supernatural thriller, helped by a haunting score. As with his earlier ""Repulsion,"" the director conveys horror not so much by what is shown as what is suggested. As a young woman undergoing a difficult pregnancy, to put it mildly, Farrow is terrific in a star-making turn. Cassavetes may be miscast as her husband, but Gordon and Blackmer are quite effective as nosy neighbors. The cast features such familiar faces as Bellamy, Cook, Henry, and Grodin."
"ags123","10","1","2","1 November 2012"," Timeless Entertainment
","One of the most remarkable things about this fine film is how little it has dated in almost half a century. Despite the lack of cell phones, computers and other current technology there is little to distract modern audiences from the plot. It's not like watching an old movie at all. Another phenomenal aspect is how well Polanski (a newcomer to the US at the time) conveyed such a trenchant feel for New York City. The direction is sure-handed and the action is well- paced. There are just the right amounts of humor thrown in to relieve the tension. ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Chinatown"" are unquestionably rivals for Polanski's best film. I think this one has the edge, as I defy anyone to not identify with the main character early on through to the end. The dream sequence is pure Polanski. In ""Repulsion"" he tried to make a whole film out of essentially a dream sequence, and it's rather contrived. Here, the surreal touches don't drive the action off course. Mia Farrow is perfect for the part and at age 23 holds her own against seasoned actors a generation or two older. John Cassavetes, who is very good as the husband, always struck me as a bit too old for the part of a struggling actor just starting out (he was 38). The supporting cast is superb, with Ruth Gordon stealing the show (and an Oscar in the process) and Patsy Kelly running a close second. ""Rosemary's Baby"" holds up well to repeated viewings and continues to entertain even after you know where all this is going. It has all the hallmarks of a classic."

Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemary's reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets' circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her. <br/><br/>This is a frightening tale of Satanism and pregnancy that is even more disturbing than it sounds thanks to convincing and committed performances by Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon.In addition to that,Polanski's camera-work and Richard Sylbert's production design transform the realistic setting into a sinister projection of Rosemary's fears, chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewer's imagination. Having escaped the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust in Poland by the skin of his teeth, Mr. Polanski was well equipped psychologically to re- imagine what was, before Rosemary's Baby, a B-picture genre into an A- picture genre.And four decades later,his supremely mounted horror thriller holds up extremely well."

With the only real problem within being a languished pace that really draws the running time up and make it far longer than it really needs to be, there's a lot to like here. One of the best aspects utilized here is the slow-burn pacing that runs through here as the events wind themselves around her entire pregnancy and that allows for the gradual unraveling of the clues, from the older couples constant interference in their daily lives and offering pregnancy tips and advice, the constant rebuttals of anything she feels as out-of-the-ordinary being commonplace and finally the gag with the name really cluing in the final act. While none of this is really centered around a series of jolts or shocks or even anything creepy beyond the hallucinogenic impregnation, that this really remains watchable as nothing happens is a strong suit of the film and really works quite well in keeping this one interesting.

"bobsgrock","Null","1","2","22 May 2012"," Remains at the high standard Polanski intended.
","Rosemary's Baby, unlike the vast majority of horror films, remains decades after its release as terrifying and unnerving as it must have been when it was first shown to audiences. This is due mainly to writer/director Roman Polanski and the universally believable and creepy performances of the cast. Having never read the book, what becomes apparent almost immediately is the overwhelming sense of dread hanging over these characters, despite the fact that the story starts out so innocently.<br/><br/>Being Polanski's first Hollywood film, it remains astonishing how in control and consistent his direction of this film is. Never straining for cheap thrills or exploitative emotions, Polanski shows here why he is to be considered among the best of directors. Each shot sets up what will happen next and the screenplay does not create a situation in which he characters are acted upon by the impersonal force of the plot. Rather, it is the characters who inject the plot with occurrences, making the end result that much more believable and unsettling.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Mia Farrow may never have found as iconic a role as she did with Rosemary Woodhouse the sweet, innocent, somewhat naive but very observant and intelligent young housewife who finds herself caught up in situations beyond her control. We empathize with her because her motivations are pure and she is as likable as a screen character can be. This is offset by the warmly creepy presence of the Castevets, played brilliantly by Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. Even John Cassavetes, better known today as America's first independent filmmaker, gives a quietly disturbing performance as the loving husband who turns out to be something we could not imagine.<br/><br/>Over forty years after its release, Rosemary's Baby continues to send chills up the spine and remains a watershed in horror film history. It needs no special effects or ugly creatures to inspire dread and fear. It does this the old-fashioned way: acting and direction."

The movie is extremely complicated and full of secretive scene.<br/><br/>İn fact Rosemary's Baby is one of the masters of twentieth century suspense and it is described as a product of the counter-cultural movement during the Vietnam War in the 1960's, a time when The Establishment were viewed with suspicion and hostility. During this time, the largest movement of modern satanism start.The director Instead of use blood and violence to scare audiences he uses genuine psychological tension. It is the differences between Rosemary's Baby and other horror films. The cast is fantastic for example Mia Farrow who play a leading role was ideal. She has got delicate beauty.She kept Rosemary's emotion sand thoughts right on her face so we know what she's thinking at all times and we can actually join her emotionally in her desperate fight to save her baby from the witches.I think what makes this movie scary is the fact that all these terrible things are happening to such an innocent, hopeless character Rosamary.If needed to explain, Rosemary (MiaFarrow) and her husband Guy(John Cassavetes) move to an apartment but they have estrange neighbors Roman ( Ruth Gordon) and Minnie Castevet( SidneyBlackmer) they seem to be very good person even though pull a trick to Rosemary .

You should make many sacrifices to see the end of the film. Because the film's time is too long. The film can be seen as a simple movie but some details have surprises. Most of the music in the film was very beautiful and impressive. I think, especially playing music at the end of the film can not been forgotten easily. Mia Farrow exhibited a great acting.

The events in the movie look like it is all about Rosemary. The near shots and creepy scenes make its quality even better. While you are watching it you really become suspicious and it truly gets you nervous. Mia Farrow's acting her character is really great. You can read her thoughts and it makes you feel she is a naive person. I must admit it is a little bit different from these days' horror movies. But I think these kinds of movies just followed path which Roman Polanski created with Rosemary's baby. In this movie Mia Farrow is acting a newlywed who discovers that her husband and her neighbors are Satanists. Before watching the movie I didn't know that Farrow earned raves for her performance. The lullaby at the first scene of the movie is sung by Mia Farrow. And the other songs of the movie are marvelous. The most effective scene of movie is when Rosemary stops the cradle with a knife and the scene which she saws the baby. The director – Roman Polanski- lets us imagine the baby. The movie is not thrill you with the easy tricks it lets the horror part to your imagination. Everything in the movie is controlled by the Satanist friends and husband. Rosemary is the one who is in the center of this chaos. The end of the movie is leads you to think about the decision of Rosemary. While you are watching this movie you can realize that the other horror movies followed the path of this movie shows. You can enjoy the director's aspect on this story."
"ElMaruecan82","10","1","2","2 June 2011"," Claustrophobia, Paranoia and Farrow Mia ...
","No bleeding, no screaming, no killing, but an absolutely terrifying cinematic experience. In ""Rosemary's Baby"", Roman Polanski's horror masterpiece, the terror is induced by two universal feelings that nourished the imagination of our worst nightmares: being alone and being vulnerable. But what's the secret of Roman's 'baby'?<br/><br/>Loneliness. ""Rosemary's Baby"" conveys a disturbing paranoid feeling all through the film, thanks to Roman Polanski's Hitchcockian virtuosity. He invites us to a cheerful and hospitable space while suggesting its claustrophobic scariness. Space plays a significant part to the story as it's constantly invaded by nosy neighbors and it gets more difficult to escape from it. The apartment which looked so spacious in the beginning, gets smaller as the movie progresses, increasing Rosemary's discomfort and ours. The yellow walls are like the bars of a golden cage keeping Rosemary alone in a suffocating atmosphere ... and still, Polanski's direction is so nuanced that we also consider the possibility of a simple case of paranoia.<br/><br/>Anyway, Mia Farrow was perfect as she genuinely embodies vulnerability. She naturally plays a young and sweet woman dreaming of having a baby and living in perfect harmony with her husband, Guy Woodhouse, portrayed by John Cassavettes. But fate lead her to the apartment right behind the Castevets' walls, Roman and Minnie, a peculiar old couple with an obnoxious nosiness. And poor Rosemary is like these shy little creatures who try to remain friendly only to hide their discomfort. Her kindness rhymes with weakness, and as if she was carrying paranoia with her baby, the more certain she'll be about the conspiracy and the necessity to protect her unborn child, the weaker and more vulnerable she'll get. How ironic ... Even the evolution of her clothes, her hair style, her pale complexion indicate a progressive sickness as if Polanski broke a taboo by depicting pregnancy with the same symbolism as for the hostile closed space. Rosemary trapped in the secret and by the secret growing in her ...<br/><br/>Rosemary's fragility is beautifully incarnated by the feminine score that accompanies the film, a music like for a cosmetic advertisement, so inconveniently peaceful we figure that there's a horrific element waiting to provide a shocking contrast. But we're only given hints during the film ... the most eloquent being the dream sequence which is so tactfully directed that despite Rosemary's shouting, we really have the feeling that this ""is a dream"" and NOT ""really happening"". We have in this scene an excellent direction by the precocious genius Roman Polanski who could have betrayed the movie's terrible secret had he handled this crucial part with a too ambitious approach. No, it was horrific enough to scare us, but surrealistic enough to be associated with a dream. The rest of the film keeps a realism that keeps our guard down, thinking that the secret is only on the surface, or that again, Rosemary may be victim of paranoia  such a brilliantly furnished plot has no room for obviousness.<br/><br/>And the 'plot', in every meaning of the word, works thanks to the masterfully constructed script. I was fooled, but I'm glad I was. The originality in ""Rosemary's Baby"" is that even the lead character couldn't know about a secret that could only be revealed after the pregnancy. She's both the most and least likely person to know and this is the horrific element driving the last act. It almost starts like Polanski's ""Chinatown"" set in an apartment, where we try to put and reassemble the pieces of the puzzle together with Rosemary, inhabited by a new strength : a poignant motherly instinct inspiring her to protect her baby from the claws of the Castevets and the others. The rest is probably one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had.<br/><br/>The whole direction of the film consists on following a poor creature lonely and fragile trying to escape from the influence of many dangerous individuals, that 'All of Them' feeling getting more and more unbearable as no one seems to help her. And the irony is that these individuals, took alone, are quite harmless, especially, Minnie Castevet, played in a delightful performance by Ruth Gordon who deserved her Oscar as the nosy neighbor. And Guy Woodhouse is just a schmuck and an opportunistic bastard. But the strength lies within the group who's like a herd of greedy wolves with Rosemary as the poor little lamb. The story is perfect and totally fit for a horror film and I really believe Mia Farrow's performance should have earned her an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>And how could I describe the famous second where Rosemary's, dressed in her pajamas, sees what's in the cradle ... the way she bugles her eyes and puts her hand in her mouth as to hide a horrific scream is probably one of the most iconic moments ever captured in a horror film. It's the quintessential shocking effect, the conclusion of a great thriller masterfully directed by Roman Polanski, and the end of a torment that was less a relief, than a realization of the degree of evil that could drive people, especially Guy who didn't hesitate to sell his soul to promote his career by providing his own woman's womb for that terrific project.<br/><br/>And yet, despite everything, the movie ends in an unexpectedly calm note as to suggest that either the motherly instinct can overcome the evil, either that Rosemary learned that the best she could do was to respond to her motherly duty and rock her baby to sleep  an ambiguity that reveals a secret to announce many others and makes the ending, despite the relief, even more terrifying <br/><br/>What's the secret of ""Rosemary's Baby""? It just knows how to keep a secret ..."

","Rosemary's Baby I watched this movie one month at the listening and pronunciation lesson with my friends in school. While I was watching this movie, at the first I found it very boring. It was boring because in the film ordinary things were happening. For example; Rosemary and her husband were searching home, and when they found home, they moved there. When they moved there, Rosemary met with one woman, who killed herself by jumping from the window, in laundry. After that, Rosemary met with her new old neighbors. These old neighbors were the people, living with woman who committed suicide. Like every couples, Rosemary and her husband wanted to have a baby. And finally Rosemary became a pregnant. These things were ordinary according to me. However, later film began to become interesting. It was interesting especially while Rosemary began to realize some facts about her husband, her neighbors and her doctor. The facts were that her husband, neighbors, and doctor were Satan or witches. She realized that facts with the help of Hutch. Hutch was Rosemary's and her husband's friend. In order to help Rosemary about this issue, Dutch gave a book to Rosemary about witches. However, this book did not given directly by Hutch, it was given by Hutch's friend because Hutch was died. And Rosemary read this book. While reading this book which was about the witches, she found some information about her neighbors. She said these information to her husband but her husband acted as if he had not believed her and without saying anything to Rosemary, he threw away this book. Because if Rosemary had attended to read this book, she would have understand the facts about them. However, later Rosemary bought another book which was like thrown book. And she read this book. And she understood that her husband, neighbors, and her old doctor who was advised by her neighbor were witches. I think this understanding process was interesting and very excited. And after all these things, Rosemary had a baby. However, they said to Rosemary that her baby was died. Firstly Rosemary believed that but later she did not believe. And she went one room which was full of Satan. And after she had gone to there, she both became sure about her husband, neighbors, doctor were Satan and learned that her baby did not die. This part is frustrating. Later she looked at her baby and she saw that her baby's eyes disgusting! I think that this was upsetting especially for the mother. And I think the film ended up in sadness. Finally, I think about the movie, at the beginning it was boring but later it became interesting, enjoyable, exciting. And later it became frustrating. And and and it finished up with sadness. And if one ask me about this movie, I strongly advise it."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","24 April 2011"," Well-acted, amazingly directed, and with an atmosphere all of it's own.
","Rosemary's Baby is perhaps the least violent 'horror' film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This is my first Roman Polanski film, and he does an amazing job. His screenplay is smart in really absorbing us into these characters' lives. The first half of the film can be seen as just a regular domestic drama in a way. He creatively directs the film so that by the time the climax comes it's just utterly fantastic. I won't say that the film was unpredictable though, partly in turns because whenever one sees a 'satan' film we hear about Rosemary's Baby. It's sort of like Psycho's big twist. It has had such a large legacy that it's shocking if you don't know what the film is really about.<br/><br/>Saying that however, this is a meticulously detailed drama-turned mystery- turned thriller- turned horror film. It's also quite fascinating how little I got based on actual physical horror. I thought Mia Farrow was fantastic in this."

","When published in 1967, Rosemary's Baby was one of the first contemporary horror novels to become a national bestseller. And that's why this film related to novel. Actually I did not read the novel but I watch Rosemary's Baby in the university ( in pronunciation and listening lesson ). And now I have a comment about that movie.<br/><br/>This film about a woman who discovers that her pregnancy is not actually normal. Rosemary ( that woman ) and her actor husband moved into the Bramford (a building in New York). Then The family meet some neighbors who are part of a satanic ritual. And strange things start to happen : She is raped by a man who is not human. But Rosemary think that it is a dream and than Rosemary falls pregnant but she think that she is pregnant by her husband. Then she begins to suspect that her neighbors have special plans for her child.<br/><br/>If we talk about the place which is shown in movies are good and interesting (exp.the building). But I cannot say the same about the musics. They are not good for me. And also the end of the movie is not good actually. But in the movie sometimes the tension heightens, we feel what Rosemary feels. Therefore you should watch this movie and add your comment."
"EijnarAmadeus","9","1","2","24 June 2009"," Fame and success - paranoia and dark spirituality
","Roman Polanski's 1968 classic 'Rosemary's Baby' deals with a subject matter that's first class horror material; the birth of Antichrist. Set in mid 60ties New York we meet the married couple of housewife Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and struggling actor Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes). Moving into their new apartment they befriend the old neighbor couple of Minnie and Roman Castavet, who Guy becomes unusually close to. Guy soon lands a major role and starts heading for success, and with this he decides to stop his self-centered behavior and focus on his wife and so they decide to have a baby. Becoming ill the same night, Rosemary encounters a terrible dream the night of the intercourse with spiritualistic and mythological aspects, which is the start of a slowly spiraling pregnancy towards darkness.<br/><br/>Polanski created a shocking film when it was released in 1968. It's thematic content is frightening and obnoxious, and it certainly lead the way for William Friedkin's 1973 'The Exorcist'. Mia Farrow's performance is her best, it's a harsh performance that shows her sickening mind and body afraid of what she's facing; Cassavetes (who was the symbol of cool and daring independent movie-making as a director in the 60ties and 70ties) pulls out a strange but interesting performance, at further viewings it may you might feel that Guy knows what's going on from the very first second, but then again, he pulls out this lovable husband that shows genuine interest in her well-being. And for me, the film is mostly engaging as an interior study of marriage facing unsureness and scare, with the pure horror elements of the plot coming second rate when it comes down at the end. It's more a drama film with a dark underbelly (with certainly interesting revelatory aspects), than a full-on shocking horror film about the birth of Antichrist. Cause like in 'The Exorcist', you have a demon-possessed little girl with a transformed, monstrous face who's vomiting, spitting, squirming, attacking and shouting crude one-liners; in 'Rosemary's Baby' we're given an intensity surrounding ""what's going on with this bright young lady?"" - and the horror comes in her grueling sickening, her more and more dominant paranoia, her husband's mysterious behavior, the old couple's weird behavior, and all the subtle clues given throughout. 'Rosemary's Baby' was a daring film back then, and its own ""under-performance"" of the plot grows more and more in mind afterward."
"cchase","9","1","2","5 December 2008"," A Traumatic Trailblazer...
","THIS is the movie that made it possible to get films like THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN green-lighted. You have to be of a certain age to remember, let alone appreciate this one, because too many of ""today's generation"" of horror film lovers have been spoon-fed so much absolute crap, they won't watch anything that doesn't have limbs and blood-filled condom squibs flying everywhere. Too bad. ROSEMARY'S BABY, though somewhat dated, is still a classic case of big-city paranoia multiplied exponentially.<br/><br/>It was William Castle who optioned Ira Levin's chart-burning bestseller, but Paramount had absolutely no confidence in his directorial abilities by this time, so the job of adaptation and direction was handed off to red-hot auteur Roman Polanski, (who - considering the tragic events that tore apart his life - was perfect for the job,) leaving Castle to produce. In hindsight, it was probably a really good idea, since the story is rooted firmly in those crazy themes that are Polanski's bread and butter - urban angst, isolation, and fear of the unknown...more the kind of unknown about your other half, your neighbors and especially yourself. <br/><br/>Mia Farrow (whose career was practically made by this movie) and critically-acclaimed actor/filmmaker John Cassavettes were perfectly cast as Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, blushingly naive newlyweds who move into a huge brownstone in Manhattan as Guy's acting career is just starting to take off. (The infamously famous Dakota - yes, THAT one - stars as their new digs.) It's big, it's dark and it's tremendously creepy in a way that undoubtedly inspired a lot of movies after it - think a much older version of Sigourney Weaver's poltergeist-infested penthouse in GHOSTBUSTERS. In other words: the perfect place to find some supernatural mischief going on.<br/><br/>Which is not what Guy and Rosemary find...well, not at first. The most they discover is that they have a pair of unbelievably friendly - and nosy - neighbors, an older couple named Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer, and in her Oscar-winning turn, the late, great Ruth Gordon.) The Castevets are just a little too interested in Guy and Rosemary's personal life, their day-to-day comings and goings, and the fact that the younger couple is very determined in adding a third member of the family very soon. <br/><br/>Remember how your mother told you never to talk to strangers? Let me add a new rule: never accept suspicious gifts or food products from the kindly little old lady next door. Besides that, there's all kinds of strange noises and general weirdness going on, conveniently when Rosie's at home by herself and Guy's out working. <br/><br/>The important thing to pay attention to is how Rosemary's freaked-out state of mind, combined with the creepy influence of the brownstone, plays an important part in the goings-on around her. Especially when people start dying - from the nice girl from across the hall she meets who ""commits suicide"", to the sudden illness and demise of family friend, Hutch (Maurice Evans). Oh, and to top it all off is one of the most chilling sequences in horror, when she does get pregnant...but there's a really good chance that Guy's not the daddy. (I don't think I have to go into a lot of details - you get the picture.)<br/><br/>Okay, so basically, the clothes, the surroundings, the pop-culture references are ""ancient"" enough to leave most newbies scratching their heads. Pay no attention to that stuff, my dears. Just let yourself soak up the atmosphere of menace and dread so superbly provided by Polanski, production designer Richard Sylbert and DP Bill Fraker (not to mention the spine-freezing score by Polish composer Krzystof Komeda). And enjoy the great performances by the leads and all the supporting cast, but especially Ms. Gordon. You'll never think of ""Noo-Yawk"" grand-bubbie types the same way again. <br/><br/>As far as recommendations go, this is NOT a rental. If you're a true horror fan, you should already have this as an essential part of your library, in the ""Satanic Specialties"" section."
"mlraymond","9","1","2","13 February 2008"," Mia Farrow is magnificent in unsettling film that mixes comedy and horror
","I was too young to see this movie when it was first shown, and I was not impressed when I finally saw it after a few years had gone by. But having seen it four or five times now, I actually believe it improves with age. It is subtle and low key, and quite slow paced by today's standards. There is far more genuinely horrifying action in Polanski's other Sixties classic Repulsion, which leads me to believe that Rosemary's Baby may actually be viewed better as a black comedy than a true horror film. Many viewers have commented on the light hearted opening, that seems almost like a typical Sixties romantic comedy. The gradual darkening of the story is so subtly done that it's almost imperceptible. A vague feeling of unease, with little in the way of overt violence or horror, starts to permeate the film. There is enough ambiguity in the way events unfold that it's possible to see Rosemary as becoming disconnected from reality and imagining a plot against her. The eccentric neighbors may be no more than a nosy but well meaning old couple, her husband's unexpected success due to the accidental misfortune of a competitor for an important part, the tragic death of a young woman a genuine suicide. Is there any actual proof that these things are more than mere coincidences? Mia Farrow's brilliant performance makes us experience these doubts and fears along with her.<br/><br/>The film is very much a product of its time, the late Sixties. It touched on many ideas and events of a world increasingly chaotic and tumultuous, in ways that audiences born since that era could not relate to without direct experience. It was made at a time in which the Vietnam war was starting to become more controversial, the sexual revolution had begun, but the women's movement and legalized abortion were still in the future, along with anti-war riots and the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. It occupies a place in history as a sort of time capsule of the era, just as momentous and overwhelming changes were in the offing. The "" God is dead"" controversy that forms much of the background of the story must seem almost quaint to viewers today, but was a major aspect of the film's controversy. <br/><br/>Viewers expecting a shocking and horrific experience will probably be disappointed, but those who can appreciate a slow building, quietly unnerving film will find much to enjoy here. Much is left to the imagination, and it requires active involvement on the viewer's part. It may require patience for those accustomed to more visceral and fast paced movies, but it is well worth taking the time to appreciate."

","Movies were constantly raising the bar for shocking in the late Sixties but few succeeded like this one. It was one of the last films officially 'Condemned' by the Catholic Legion of Decency. The dream sequences were easily the best of their time and continue to hold up well. Polanski's delight in the medium is palpable throughout but it never distracts from the narrative. The movie's texture --sophisticated Manhattan, but attainable-- resonates beautifully in the Christmas season scenes and later, when the temperature rises and Rosemary fumbles in a public phone booth. Note the gay friends at Ro and Guy's party. All the actors are in top form. Mia Farrow, lovely and vulnerable but crucially believable. Cassavettes as an ambitious actor, young but his biological clock is ticking. Did the Catholic Church get it right? This exemplifies the subversive power of cinema."

Everyone else at The Bramford (Manhattan's notorious Dakota) seems oddly out of step with the world, older, a bit too friendly, and not quite what they seem. Roman Polanski's first American production, Rosemary's Baby (1968) is the story of a young woman (Mia Farrow) who has either become the innocent victim of a depraved Satanist cult, impregnated by the Devil himself, or has lost her mind to the hormonal ravages of pregnancy. Polanski's great delight in presenting stories from the point of view of the central character leaves the viewer wondering to the very last ambiguous shot. What remains indisputable however, is this films place as the finest, most original and frightening example of psychotic-nightmare horror to come out of new Hollywood and the inspiration for countless other films."

","Rosemary and Guy, a newly married couple, moved into an apartment in a building with a very bad reputation. However, everything was wonderful. They wanted to have a baby and their neighbors were really kind and friendly but perhaps too much. <br/><br/>Roman Polanski, author of masterpieces such as Chinatown, is one of the most controversial directors. He portrays an atmosphere of suspense and gives some clues as to the film's dark edges. Nevertheless, there are no sinister looking locations or creepy characters. <br/><br/>Mia Farrow performs brilliantly as Rosemary. She is an innocent young woman who only wants to please her husband and have a baby. However, everything changes when she gets pregnant. Guy becomes distant when he succeeds in TV and her neighbors become overly caring. She grows suspicious of them because she realizes that she is strictly controlled.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of horror. Everyday situations have an undercurrent of evil. These skilfully hid details haunt the viewer. An odd closet, a suicide, her neighbors' extreme interest As the date of birth gets closer, the film grows increasingly claustrophobic. The development of the plot gets interrupted abruptly in the last scenes, when the intrigue is revealed. The ending is spine-chilling but predictable due to the innocent and caring Rosemary's nature. <br/><br/>I have seen this film many times but I always have the same terrifying feeling; the anti-Christ is ascending to power surrounded by an atmosphere of friendship and neighborliness. I would recommend it to all horror-loving viewers who are tired of inane plots and special effects."
"lensman-4","Null","1","2","6 February 2003"," The Book was just as boring
","First off I have to say that when I read the book about 6 years ago I was looking forward to seeing the movie to see if it would be any better.  Well, I was wrong.  I don't understand all of the praise this movie has received. I am not one of those into schlock horror where it has to be gory to be scary.  I have seen many movies that are more suspenseful than this, such as the remake of House on Haunted Hill, Frighteners, The Exorcist, The Haunting, and I could keep going.  I like suspense, I am a fan of the 1940's ghost and haunted house movies which hold more suspense than this movie. <br/><br/>
Yes, I read the book so I knew everything that was going to happen, in fact the movie did not deviate from the book one iota. The screen writing had nothing to do with Roman Polanski, and everything to do with Ira levin's book.  The movie was so slow that I was bored to tears.  Yes, the cinematography was gorgeous, the apartment building was beautiful, and the elderly neighboor couple had an underlying sinister quality to the seeming ""dotty"" exterior.  But, that does not make a movie.  <br/><br/>Because the movie was trying to be ""normal"" the supposed suspense was not there.  At no time in the movie, except for the dream sequences and the very end was there any suspension of disbelief.  The Main character did not progress into the unreal till the climax and the climax was so fast in the resolution that there was no satisfaction.  The slowness of the movie so put me off that I was cooking dinner at the same time and knew exactly what was going on without even looking up at the television.  I also thought that the ""rape"" scene was a little creepy, but at no time did Mia Farrow look horrified.  I have had a rape dream and even in the dream I was fighting and kicking and trying to get free, I can't believe that someone would be so out of their mind that there would be no fighting back, even if it is verbal protestations, which there were none. I don't understand the extreme praise of this movie, it is slow, boring and goes nowhere till the last 25-30 minutes.<br/><br/>I also did not like the movie for a more personal reason.  I am a practicing Witch, and anybody who is a practicing Witch will tell you that Satan is a Christian Icon, not a witchcraft Icon.  I felt like Mr. Levin and Mr. Polanski read the Malleus Malefictarum a little too much and believed that what is contained was how Witches really were.  The pagan community has been trying to live down the stereotypes of Witches and Pagans that this movie and others has perpetuated.  No witches and pagans do not worship Satan, nor pray to him, or acknowledge him in any way, shape or form.  I know this is deviating a little from the main subject, but if the movie had been about say, blacks or hispanics, or any one of another race, or color, there would be uproar, especially in the late 60's, but no, let's write a book, and make a movie about Satan worshipping Witches, because you know, they don't matter.  Well you know what folks, we do matter, and we are starting more and more to stand-up for ourselves, and the Christian right-wing be damned. (Sorry for the little tirade there, but it just burns my A** everytime)."

Throughout most of it's running time it all looks so 60's: the clothing, the hair, and most noticably, the music. In fact, a scene near the end that should be edge-of-your-seat terrifying ends up becoming merely nerve-wracking due to the distracting music.<br/><br/>The plot, however, remains razor sharp. As Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy move into a new upscale New York City apartment, strange things begin happening all around them, things that may in some sinister way be related to Rosemary's budding new pregnancy. Equally perturbing, but not as obviously demonic are Rosemary's new neighbors, a nosy and intrusive elderly couple who seem determined to interfere with her personal business.<br/><br/>The movie moves at a very slow pace, (in fact, for the first hour and a half it's difficult to accurately describe this as a true horror film) but everything in this movie has a purpose. Scenes that seem to have no relevence come full circle by the end. Despite it's plodding storyline, ROSEMARY'S BABY almost demands a repeated viewing.<br/><br/>All of this builds up to the terrifying climax that is undoubtably one of the most disturbing and horrifying in cinematic history. But, in another way, this movie is a portrait of a simpler time. When it was released in 1968, ROSEMARY'S BABY was a shocking and contraversial movie like nothing that had been seen before. Over the decades, much of the shock has worn off. And maybe what's more frightening is that the notion of a ritualistic Satanic cult is no longer packs the shock value it once did.<br/><br/>(***/****)"

","I feel so ashamed that it took me over 20 years to see this movie. I am sure it will be stuck in my mind for a very long time. From the opening score, i could tell i was in store for one hell of a film. I just finished it ten minutes ago, so i'm pretty lost for words. It's amazing how such powerful films can leave you so breathless and speechless. I would try to write a review now, but i'm too in awe to say anything meaningful.<br/><br/>
Fans of this movie should also see Harold and Maude, which stars the late, great Ruth Gordon in another charming performance. She won an Oscar for Rosemary's Baby for Best Supporting Actress, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>
The music group Fantomas (created by Faith No More's Mike Patton) does a spectacular cover of the Rosemary's Baby score; it's eerie, haunting, and intense. Be sure to check that out! Also, for your own sanity, please try to avoid In-awe-of-the-masters' review of this movie. It is so ignorant, full of mistakes, and will probably make you really mad.

","Rosemary's Baby is one of the most diabolically evil and twisted films ever made.  The film is a masterpiece of sorts in its ability to be creepy and dangerous at the same time.  Mia Farrow shines as one of the most memorable female characters in film history.

Polanski did justice to Ira Levin's seminal antithesis to the first few chapters of the Gospel of Luke.  The name of the book and movie are just astounding itself.  Mia Farrow was well cast as the paranoid and protective Rosemary.  Ruth Gordon was excellent as the sugar-coated, sour-centered next door neighbor.  The story was provocative, spooky, and it got under my skin. It ranks in my ""skin-crawling"" movie list.

","I saw this movie first like nine years ago, and I was so deeply impressed that I gave it a *9* when I joined the Movie Database - an unusually high rating because thrillers are not my favorite genre. Furthermore, when I saw it for the second time - afew days ago - I remembered every detail; what a higher compliment can you make to a movie? Although you might say that the topic is - nowadays - a bit 'old-fashioned' - and object that, during the last fifteen minutes, there are some superfluous explanations, you have to admit that every little finger-movement in the film is well-thought, that the moment when Mia Farrow has the first look to her 'baby' is TERRIFIC, that Cassavete's silent metamorphosis during the film is absolutely convincing, that all the acting in its blend of everyday behavior and cruelty is simply perfect - and so is the whole movie. At the second view, it might not make you shiver as at the first time. But you won't find an 'error' nor any tastelessness. (The good taste is something of the time, I guess; despite the differences, Hitchcock has it, too.)"
"pzm","Null","1","2","4 October 1999"," Hail Rosemary
","You can see what attracted Polanski to this script. It recalls his earlier Repulsion - the apartment which becomes a prison, the gradual disintegration of the young woman who inhabits it, even the increasingly unpalatable contents of the fridge. In formal terms, Rosemary's Baby is a gleefully blasphemous parody of the Life of the Virgin (whose name, of course, is entangled in Rosemary's own) - right down to a travestied Adoration of the Magi in the devastating closing scene, in which one of the wise men from the East appears as a Japanese tourist with a Pentax. But this blackest of comedies everywhere bears the imprint of Polanski's nightmarish fugitive childhood in the Poland of the Holocaust. Betrayal awaits at every turn; prying neighbours mean only harm; the uncomprehending and incomprehensible normality of the outside world seems the cruellest taunt. The evocation of evil is all the more chilling for its hilarious banality - the coven of old dears next door are as devoted to knitting and soft furnishings as to the Prince of Darkness. And at the film's heart, beyond the mockery, is Mia Farrow's harrowing transformation from Mary Quant mannequin to a gaunt and suffering spectre from the concentration camps, shorn and hollow-eyed - as if the film were haunted by the memory of the director's own mother, murdered at Auschwitz. Polanski coaxes a performance of aching vulnerability from Farrow as the not-so-bright child bride impregnated by a distinctly unholy ghost in hubby's Faustian pact - as pure in her simple, dogged saintliness as Bresson's Joan of Arc.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the most telling shot in the film - Minnie Castevets glimpsed through the bedroom doorway as she phones Bad Obstetrician, our view disconcertingly half-obstructed by the door-jamb in the foreground - is one that Polanski used again, and to the same troubling effect, some 20 years later in the opening scene of Frantic."

","This is quite simply an incredibly engrossing film.  Easily one of the best films of the horror/suspense genre, it benefits from a strong cast and enough time to flesh out the story.  There are not a lot of films of this genre that can maintain a level of suspense past the 100 minute mark, but this film at nearly 2 hours and 20 minutes has no problem what so ever with that.  If one did not know what the film was about when they first started watching, one would think it was about a young couple beginning their life together (kind of like ""Barefoot in the Park""), but when the mysterious circumstances begin to take place and the strange neighbors come on the scene, one knows they're in for a rollercoaster ride of suspense.

This movie is probably second only to the Exorcist because it is one of only a few films in the true gothic tradition.  Anyone that has read HP Lovecraft knows what I am talking about. Everything is designed just slightly askew, like the way the characters eat too fast or that bizarre accent of the lady next door. Nothing is as it seems, and that is the true beauty of it. <br/><br/>
My complaint is that films like this do not receive the respect they deserve.  In today's MTV culture anything that isn't exploding every five minutes is a sleeper.  What happened to the time when people had the patience to watch a film that had depth to it?  I realize that being in the top 30 of the IMDB ranking should be quite good, but why isn't it number 2? I enjoy comedy as much as the next person, but a film like Young Frankenstein does not deserve to be occupying spots in a serious genre.

The cinematography is both striking and atmospheric, with lighting that always helps to enhance the mood, while the music and sound effects are haunting and the story is compelling.<br/><br/>The script is yet another strength, all the psychological horror is there and done with genuinely unnerving effect, it has plenty of paranoia mixed with the odd bit of morbid humour. I couldn't have asked for better acting either. Mia Farrow is in I feel her best performance here, and she is an ideal satanic foil.<br/><br/>John Cassevetes is suitably selfish and frustrated, and then there's Ruth Gordon who is wonderfully eccentric and in a menacing sense.

","Rosemary's Baby (1968) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Polanski's eerie and disturbing film about a couple (Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes) who move into a new apartment complex and think their lives are about to take off. Soon the wife finds herself pregnant but fears start to slip in that her eccentric neighbors might be trying to do her and the baby harm. She finds out that they could be part of a coven of witches and that they might just be needing the baby for evil deeds. I'm not one who thinks this is a flawless movie as I do have a couple issues with Polanski's screenplay but there's no question that the film contains a certain cold atmosphere and some great performances that make it worth viewing. I think the real key to the film's success is the direction by Polanski because he perfectly blends all the elements and really makes a complete film. I love how the movie starts off with this sweet and innocent nature as if you were watching the happiest film in the world. These calm moments are handled perfectly by the director and he also manages to direct the darker scenes just as masterfully. The dream sequences are brilliantly done and some of them are extremely disturbing to watch. Polanski also handles the smaller, personal drama well and one of the best scenes in the movie happens when Rosemary is in the phone booth trying to find someone to help her. The way Polanski directs this sequence is flawless and Farrow really hits it out of the park and delivers the paranoia that the movie needs. Farrow is simply magnificent in her role as she nails every emotion that she has to play. I really found her chilling in her paranoia that someone is possibly trying to kill her kid. Cassavetes is also excellent even though I think one of the screenplay's major faults is how his character falls in with this group out of no where and the fact that his character comes off as a creepy from scene one. Supporting players Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Bellamy, Maurice Evans and Patsy Kelly are extremely good as well. The disturbing nature of a child being harmed is something that has been attempted in many movies both before and after this one but the creepiness that Polanski brings to the subject is something that hasn't been matched. I've never really cared for the decision of Rosemary at the end of the movie but Polanski's direction through this scene makes one understand what he was going for and what he was trying."

I would like to combine it with other horror movies that have lots of violence and gore, but has sorry stories and actors in it as this one does have a good story and acting. It just tends to get a bit tedious at times for my tastes, not taking anything away from the movie mind you, if you like it you probably have better tastes than I a person whose favorite genre of horror is the zombie movie, the genre most consider the lowest of the low. The story has a woman who is pregnant and something seems to be going wrong. Simple enough, eh? Actually the story is a lot more interesting and complex than that line, but that line works good too. She has some rather seemingly helpful neighbors at first, but they seem odd to. The husband also is quite the normal husband at first, but he too seems to succumb to what everyone else in the building seems to be doing. Of course, as interesting as the story is, it is also quite long and tedious to watch, I needed a break from watching it at times. Still the payoff is rather good in a underdone kind of way that makes it work all the more. Ruth Gordon is excellent in this film, it is to bad she just about undermines this role by playing in the horrid direct to television sequel."

Her old close friend warned her they could be witches.And she started to search something about them. She gave up drinking it which the neighbors brought. Their neighbors suspected that she realized that they were witches. When she had a baby, they took her baby. She realized certainly they were witches. But she could not do anything about it.

There was just one scene in the end that I thought was a little suspenseful; it was when Rose was messing with some towels in a closet with a camera that kept fading to black.

They didn't expect slasher gore or quick cuts to show gruesome body parts on display. They wanted the story to develop at its own pace and then deliver the goods for a substantial conclusion.<br/><br/>And this is what ROSEMARY'S BABY does so efficiently. It starts slowly and only gradually do we come to realize that something much more serious than just eccentric neighbors is going on here. Best of the eccentrics is RUTH GORDON who rightfully won a Supporting Role Oscar for her work as Minnie, the overly solicitous neighbor who watches so carefully over the pregnant MIA FARROW. Hubby JOHN CASSAVETES seems to be concerned too but that turns out to be for other reasons.<br/><br/>There are several good supporting roles, but another performer who stands out is RALPH BELLAMY as the doctor Rosemary confides in when she begins to suspect things are wrong.<br/><br/>It's a good screen version of Ira Levin's novel and MIA FARROW does a commendable job as the worried and confused young wife.

","Back in 1968 I attended the UK premiere of this film. I had seen some of Polanski's early Polish shorts, his first feature, Knife in the Water as well as Repulsion and Cut-De-Sac and was already a great fan. That I was now to see the much hyped film Hitchcock had turned aside perhaps led to my expecting too much and I was bitterly disappointed in this overlong and overblown movie filled with hammy performances and Mia farrow looking and acting like some schoolgirl. Watching it again, after a viewing of The Mephisto Waltz, I imagined that 'class' would show through and that I had been nothing but a petulant youngster all those years ago. But, no, this seemingly much loved 'classic horror' really is rather lacking in substance. I guess the satanic sequence, still good but tame by today's standards had much greater impact originally and although I think Farrow's performance generally poor, she is excellent in a very fine telephone booth sequence towards the end. It may be that Polanski was in awe of her playing the skinny little girl and only now and again let her show her real potential and let rip in a scene or two that could have come from Hitch himself."

","Assuming that pretty much everyone knows about the plot of this film by now, I won't pen down another synopsis... Personally, I always thought that Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is much more of an intelligently scripted conspiracy-drama, rather than a diabolical horror story. The most captivating element about this film is NOT the presence of witch covens and devil-worshipers, but the depressing transformation Mia Farrow's character goes through. Rosemary Woodhouse is introduced as a healthy and happily married housewife with a strong desire to raise a family but near the end she's a tormented woman, obviously hurt and disappointed by the people she cared for most. The screenplay of this classic title  adapted from Ira Levin's novella by Polanski himself  definitely doesn't rush things and establishes an atmospheric portrait in which it's never really clear whether the occurring events are real...or fragments of Rosemary's frustrated imagination. Polanski severely tests his viewers here! You presume that the supernaturalness is there and that there really are witches, since you mainly witness it all from Rosemary's viewpoints but ... Aren't we imagining as well? The constant and brutal blending of reality and hallucination is what really feels disturbing here... And I can guarantee it's more genuinely disturbing than showing actual witch-rites or bloody massacres. This surely isn't a film for all types of audiences, since it's very slow and almost bloodless. If you don't approach the story in the right state of mind, many sequences will seem tedious and pointless. Many aspects also look quite dated by now (woman luckily aren't as docile and obedient to their husbands anymore) and the intense melancholia-tone often is very hard to digest."
"TheNorthernMonkee","5","3","17","19 December 2004"," overrated and takes too long to get going
","SPOILERS In 1968, Roman Polanski directed horror film ""Rosemary's Baby"". Often described as horrifying in it's plot and eventual ending, the film has sadly not aged well. Taking far too long to get going, it feels tacky and weak and fails to hit any sort of note.<br/><br/>Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a happily married couple. Moving into a new home, the two decide to have a baby. As Rosemary progresses through her pregnancy however, incidents occur which begin to cause her to question the motives behind the helpful neighbours Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). Perhaps there is a sinister motive behind their actions.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Rosemary's Baby"" is that it just is no longer scary. With Roman Polanski directing and writing the screenplay, it's not hard to see why in 1968 this freaked out so many people. The notion of things happening without us seeing them has always been the basis behind so many good horror films. The human imagination is often more scary than films themselves. Sadly though, with this film, the horror only arrives in the final 30 minutes and it ultimately feels like a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow as Rosemary is admittedly superb in a tough role, but she is overshadowed by the unnerving Ruth Gordon. Both women in their respective roles suit the plot perfectly, but that's where the compliments end.<br/><br/>All in all, if you ask one of the older generations about the time they went to see this film at the cinema, they will probably tell you that it was unnerving. This is the same generation who found ""The Exorcist"" (1973) shocking and whilst individuals have grown up and cinema has progressed, these older works have turned stagnant. The plot has remained slow and irritating, but now the camera quality and costume have become outdated and annoying too.<br/><br/>Sadly ""Rosemary's Baby"" will have been a good film in the 1960s. In the 21st century however, it has dated badly and is not at the top of most people's list. Mediocre and not the best way to spend the evening."

","After hearing from a lot of horror movie fans that this is regarded as one of the best horror films of all time, I was intrigued to watch this movie. I love a lot of old horror films, such as The Fly (1958), Night Of the Living Dead (1968), The Last Man On Earth (1964), and Carnival of Souls (1962) to name a few. I was disappointed in Rosemary's Baby, however. The only creepy and suspenseful scene in my opinion was the rape scene. Almost the entire movie was dedicated to showing the pregnancy, attempting to build it up for a big finale, but the only real adversity shown during the pregnancy was pain in Rosemary's torso. It didn't exactly add any anxiety to the viewer, in fact if not for the rape scene earlier in the movie, one would have thought the movie was just a drama depicting the everyday struggles of soon-to-be parents. Without giving any spoilers, the ""big finale"" was very anticlimactic, and the ""twist"" was easily foreseen in the first third of the movie. It was not a shock and even for back when the movie came out, other horror movies had more impactful, shocking twists, such as the aforementioned Carnival of Souls that predates Rosemary's Baby by six years. Mia Farrow's acting was terrible and way overdone. It wasn't believable and was over-exaggerated to the point of breaking immersion at times. John Cassavetes's acting however was pretty good, and the rest of the cast varied from okay acting to fairly decent acting. Although everyone except for John Cassavetes was way over-exaggerating to new levels in the very last act. In fact, the acting at the very end by everyone was so hammed up, it was both cringey and made me burst out laughing to think it was and is considered spooky. Again looking at other films around the same time and predating this movie, I can't see this acting being considered good even at the era's standards. Vincent Price always delivered great, believable performances, being in movies for a couple decades before Rosemary's Baby came out. I just don't see how Mia Farrow's acting was praised at the time. The ""horror"" of the movie is only slightly scratched on the surface and deals with themes explored in more depth in earlier horror films. They could have done a lot more with the horror aspects of the story. If they cut out the supernatural from the plot and made it a drama movie about a newly married couple, I think I would have enjoyed this movie more, and that's a type of film I've never been interested in before. It was 2 hours of disappointment and does not stand out from all the horror movies released in the 1960's. I would like to hope that the novel the movie is based on is better, but watching this movie does not make me want to read the book so I will probably never find out."

The biggest compliment I can give this movie is that the characters provided in the story don't feel like actors/actresses portraying a part, they feel like real people attending their everyday lives. I felt like I was baselessly peeping into the lives of real people experiencing real traumatic events, and that's saying a lot since some seriously berserk stuff goes down in this film. Rosemary's Baby is doubtlessly one of the most persuasive, and unsettling dramatic thrillers I have ever gutted. It's parallels to difficult and more burdensome themes that other films wouldn't dare explore, are boldly risky yet decidedly respectable. Rosemary's Baby is the upholding standard (or literal definition) of flawless ""psychological horror."" Despite my considerably negative feelings towards Polanski as a person, as a filmmaker, I can give him top-credit for his masterful direction and perfect writing that can simply not be compared with against any other household name during the era in which Rosemary's Baby was released (AKA, the 60s). (Verdict: A+)"
"Darth_Osmosis","10","1","3","25 May 2018"," Devilishly good!
","The best psychological horror movie I have ever seen, the main character begins to question things about his or her surroundings in many movies, but this one actually can make the viewer do that! About one point in particular many people think they saw something that really wasn't in the movie.. it's mostly the superb atmosphere that makes this one stand out, it knows exactly when and how much to reveal or hold back! Also mostly subtle, but very effective score!"
"classicsoncall","8","1","3","3 March 2018"," ""Tannis, anyone?""
","As I write this, the current year is the Fiftieth Anniversary of the movie's release, and even though I'm older than the picture, I've never seen it before. Like anyone else, I've known about it forever, and can't really explain why it's taken so long to get around to it. Probably the most startling thing about the picture when it was all over was the idea that director Roman Polanski achieved what is considered one of the best horror movies of all time, without actually showing any horror. It's really uncanny how the mystery and suspense builds as housewife Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) gradually learns that her pregnancy is under assault by a scheming neighbor couple and her own actor husband (John Cassavetes), who's traded his integrity for a shot at celebrity fame and glory by offering the unborn baby to a coven of witches. One's only glimpse of a demonic presence occurs during Rosemary's fevered nightmare following an evening of alcoholic gaiety, with the viewer left unclear as to the identity of the future baby's 'real' father. By the time Rosemary figures out that she's in great danger, she runs the risk of sounding like a mental case attempting to explain her fears to anyone who might take her seriously. For anyone expecting a glimpse of the Satanic offspring, once again it's better left to the imagination of the viewer to conjure up a mental image that matches up with the idea that ""Satan is his Father, and his name is Adrian"". Unlike the expressed visual horror of a picture like ""Psycho"", this one will slowly wrap it's tentacles around your brain and squeeze it for that last drop of adrenalin. Don't wait fifty years to see it."
"iandavidrastall","10","1","3","11 December 2017"," A Comedy For Sadists
","Polanski had already revealed a penchant for cruelty in his previous films, as well as the sadist's core belief that innocence equals victimhood and victimhood is a character defect that justifies cruelty. In ""Repulsion"" we get some voyeuristic fanservice of a fragile, virginal character (thanks to some careful lighting). In ""Fearless Vampire Killers"" we see the joke is that fearlessness has made the heroes into victims. But in ""Rosemary's Baby"" Polanski has created an entire film to be served up as delicious comedy to those in the know.<br/><br/>The film needs Rosemary (think Virgin Mary, think thorns) to be innocent and weak. Sadists would see that right away as deliciously inviting. (If she were the girl at the beginning of Salo, those four monstrous men would indeed be on their feet at her pleas for help). She's in a web, and her future is already decided. That's one notable thing about this film. Her fate is already decided before the film starts, and we're just watching her approach that grim end helplessly.<br/><br/>As one finds in transgressive cinema, or in, say, the writings of the Marquis de Sade, a sadist's fantasy would not be complete without a momentary escape for the victim. A seeming end to the madness. And we get that. Cruelty depends on crushing hope. Of course she is broken finally, and at that moment of tragedy made to submit to her captors.<br/><br/>Her increasing hysteria is meant to be funny. Maybe to ""straight"" audiences -- or at least straight audiences unaware of the tropes of sadism -- this is scary. But I don't think it's really supposed to be that way.<br/><br/>With all this going on in the background, ""Rosemary's Baby"" works very well on repeat viewings. It doesn't matter how down with the comedy you are. Study yields endless (bitter) fruit. And I can see why people say it's cursed. (Probably a myth.) It remains one of the most evil films ever released.<br/><br/>Of course it also represents Polanski at a creative peak, and that's saying something. ""Knife In The Water"" and ""Repulsion"" were masterpieces in their own right, but this is a tour de force. Worth studying, for the camera, for the performances, for the atmosphere and detail -- as well as for the transgression beneath the suspense."

"filipemanuelneto","9","1","3","15 February 2017"," One of the great classics of horror movies.
","Roman Polanski is a classic and his long career has consecrated him as one of the most influential directors of the twentieth century, although I don't have any sympathy for him as a person. This film is probably one of the most notorious and acclaimed of his career, and rightly so. When it debuted, in the late sixties, it was scary and I fully understand why. More than other horror movies so far, it used the permanent tension to keep the audience in absolute discomfort, not to mention that danger around a baby is something that touches the emotional side of anyone. It's something innate. The story takes place in an apartment building and revolves around Rosemary, a young woman who impregnates after having had a mysterious nightmare, when something possessed her sexually. Finally, other revelations, and the attitudes of a couple of elderly seemingly loving neighbors, convince her that she expects a son of the Devil, the Antichrist himself. Terrifying, is not? With such a good script it was easy to succeed, especially when Polanski so cleverly uses visual and sound effects as well as cinematography, misty and dense. Everything was thoughtfully designed to make us tense. Rape scenes are worthy of anthology. Today, by themselves, they don't scare us, horror movies have been so full of gore and blood that these scenes have lost their strength, but if we embed them in the film, they contribute a lot to our discomfort. Mia Farrow was at the highest level during the film, perhaps the most controversial of her career, since neither her husband supported her. Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon glared at the Castevets, the movie's villains. John Cassavetes is more restrained but does very well with his role. At present, this movie may not scare you as much as it scared you in the past, everything has its expiration date, but it remains one of the great classics of horror and must have a place on the shelf of any lover of this movie genre."
"theocharous_an","9","1","3","31 January 2017"," An amazing thriller that keeps you guessing
","I'm not a fan of the horror genre and I have to admit that I get scared easily. There are some films though that I just couldn't miss and Rosemary's Baby is one of them. Watching it made me realize once again how big is the gap between our days and the 60's. The film has nothing to do with horror movies released in the 21st century and actually it isn't that scary. That's not to say it isn't good. On the contrary, it's a great psychological thriller that keeps you wondering until the very end.<br/><br/>Set in New York City, the story starts with a young couple, Rosemary and Guy (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes respectively), recently married as it seems, who are looking to buy an apartment. They eventually settle in the ""Bramford"" dismissing their friend Hutch's (Maurice Evans) scary stories about infamous incidents that happened there. They soon get befriended by the wealthy old couple that lives next to them, Minnie and Roman (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer respectively). When under strange circumstances Rosemary gets pregnant, Minnie and Roman offer their help. Minnie arranges for her to have one of the best obstetricians in the city and prepares a herbal drink for her every day. As the day of delivery comes closer mysterious events start to occur that cause Rosemary to be suspicious of everyone around her.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski proves his immerse talent in this film which is actually his first book adaptation ever. Supposedly, he was unaware that directors often adjusted book stories to make their films, resulting in Rosemary's Baby being the most faithful adaptation ever according to the author Ira Levin. Polanski (or maybe we should say Levin) effectively manipulates the audience from the beginning of the film. We are first presented with ominous events and rumours so to get a feeling that something terrible is going to happen. However, as we move on, despite Rosemary's fears and suspicions, there's hardly any proof for her outrageous allegations. She suspects her neighbours, but all they do is provide her with a herbal drink. She suspects her obstetrician, but he is one of the most renowned in the city, respected even by people that she trusts like Hutch and Dr. Hill. So, since we only follow the events from her point of view, we begin to doubt her. I mean, it's only natural for a mother to worry too much for her unborn child. What if all these are just in her imagination and the 2-3 unfortunate events are just coincidences? Unfortunately, the film's reputation precedes it. I knew something was going to happen from the beginning. It must have been a great experience back in 1968 when the audience was completely unaware of it. It still makes for an exhilarating picture though. The most impressive thing about the film, and the one that differentiates it so much from modern horror films, is that we never see anything visually scary. We don't see any gory scenes or scary satanic rituals or jump scares. We don't even get to see a single glimpse of the baby! It's all in the mind.<br/><br/>Technically, Rosemary's Baby is flawless. Roman Polanski did an excellent job. The acting is solid and it's no surprise that Ruth Gordon's portrayal of the sinister Minnie Castevet won an Oscar. The score is the icing on the cake and the mesmerizing lullaby sung by Mia Farrow at the beginning and end of the film is one of the most memorable and haunting elements of the feature. What else is needed to say when the film is still discussed and analyzed today almost 50 years later? Even the reclusive Stanley Kubrick was reportedly impressed by it. An amazing picture altogether.<br/><br/>More reviews at: https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/"
"dougdoepke","Null","1","3","22 January 2017"," Brilliantly Constructed
","Just a few remarks on seeing the movie again years after its initial release. What a cleverly constructed screenplay (Polanski). We never know more than central character Rosemary (Farrow). That way her gradual realization becomes ours too. Of course, we know in advance from the film's reputation that an infernal plot is underway to envelop her, but still the narrative captivates. Who exactly is involved in the plot remains unclear, along with the details. Tip-offs gradually emerge as when old Minnie (Gordon) insists on the hellish concoction that Rosemary must drink. But then Gordon plays Minnie in such a goofy gadfly manner, it's hard to think of her as a witch. All in all, it's that clever narrative construction combining our awareness with Rosemary's that's the crux of a fascinating film. And given the lengthy two-hour-plus runtime, that's no mean fete. Then too, shouldn't overlook Farrow's career topping performance as the besieged victim. In fact, it's hard for me to think of anyone else as the waifish mother-to-be. Anyway, it's a brilliant horror film in spite of spilling scarcely a drop of blood. Contemporary filmmakers could take note."

","Wonderful work by Roman Polanski! The real life tragedies that occurred after the film left chills up my spine. Real shock after the uplift of Hays at the time. The screenplay itself was magnificent. Many twists and turns that kept the audience holding on. Mia Farrow's acting perfected this film, even eating raw liver for one of the scenes! Her dedication to the aspects of both acting and sound, as in her lullaby singing in the intro and exit of the film, made this project a success! Would not recommend watching alone, but a great psychological thriller to sit down with close minded friends. Farrow's performance left us in question the whole time and what a twist!"
"Leofwine_draca","8","1","3","4 November 2016"," No effects or action, yet this horror film's a terrifying classic
","Polanski's undisputed classic of the horror genre fully deserves the status that it holds. This is a film packed with tension and understated terror that expertly wrings maximum unease from the audience via some great performances and an oppressive atmosphere of fear and distrust. Polanski's direction really draws out the claustrophobic confines of the apartment in which most of the action takes place, and the literate script brings to mind earlier classics like THE SEVENTH VICTIM which substituted atmosphere and style over special effects and clichés. Creepy, suspenseful, thoughtful, intelligent...these are just some of the words that can be used to describe this film.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow is very good as the film's lead; brilliantly conveying paranoia and mistrust as she becomes convinced of the devil cult around her. Her physical alteration halfway through the film comes as a great shock. John Cassavetes expertly conveys charisma and ambition as her actor husband; and yet there's always something slightly sinister about him too. The supporting cast here are particularly good, indeed not one person puts a foot wrong. Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer excel as the friendly neighbourhood Satanists, not of the usual variety. Maurice Evans is excellent in a sympathetic turn as a family friend. And it's great to see cameos from genre veterans Elisha Cook Jr. and William Castle (ironically this film was his biggest success... as a producer).<br/><br/>Most young film fans will undoubtedly find this movie to be hard going; I did too, in places, although not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The running time clocks in at just over two and a quarter hours, so there's a lot to get through. The total lack of effects, violence and action actually succeeds in making this a greater film; their exclusion brings it closer to reality that it might have been otherwise. Made in an age when characterisation and plot were more important than CGI and one-liners, ROSEMARY'S BABY is arguably Polanski's best film and a true genre classic."

","Rosemary's Baby is a work of sheer brilliance that left me in complete awe. The music, the direction, the cast, and the atmosphere is everything that some modern horror should take notes on.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski is a master of his craft and he perfectly builds up the tension in every scene that makes the mystery even more engaging, as you the audience get interested in what's going on like Mia Farrow character. Speaking of Mia Farrow, shes pretty damn amazing in this and one of her best performance I've seen from her. The same goes to the rest of the cast, especially John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon.<br/><br/>The movie is a slow burn, but the pay off is satisfying and I always like that in movies when everything adds up to the end.

"cleigh115","9","1","3","12 May 2015"," Horror film without all the special effects
","Certainly one of the best horror/suspense films ever made. It is a chilling psycho-drama, a social commentary, and a good old-fashioned horror yarn all at once. It's difficult to break it all down, because there is so much that contributes to the sheer fear this movie gives off. The story takes a little while to get going, but once we're into Rosemary's pregnancy the stakes begin to rise and suspense is unrelenting. This movie is an example of the horror genre done right; there are spine-chilling moments, satanic images and horror themes that will stay with you forever. The editing in these parts is very impressive as well, creating visual illusions without special effects. The important thing to pay attention to is how Rosemary's freaked-out state of mind, combined with the creepy influence of the brownstone, plays an important part in the goings-on around her. Especially when people start dying, from the nice girl from across the hall she meets who ""commits suicide"", to the sudden illness and demise of family friend, Hutch. Oh, and to top it all off is one of the most chilling sequences in horror, when she does get pregnant...but there's a really good chance that Guy's not the father. The performances are excellent. Polanski did not go for cheap scares. In this case you could enjoy the movie much more than you could enjoy the cheap bloody scary movies."
"poe426","10","1","3","6 October 2014"," Bad Seed, indeed...
","Roman Polanski's version of ROSEMARY'S BABY isn't quite as subtle as some have led others to believe: when ""the father"" begets The Child, for instance, we actually SEE Big D in action and he's a scaly, monstrous creature. In the hands of a lesser director, the scene could've been ridiculous, but Polanski manages to pull it off without too much fanfare. Cassavettes is good as the actor willing to sell not only HIS soul but the souls of every member of his family to get what he wants, but it's Mia Farrow as Rosemary who makes the movie a classic: she never once strikes the wrong note, and her reactions at the end of the movie are particularly noteworthy. There's a subtlety to her final scenes that can't be overlooked or denied- she MAKES the movie (with a little help from Polanski). Horror fans could conceivably view ROSEMARY'S BABY as a prequel to movies like THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST (to name but a few)."

It was scary, not in the special effects (although they were excellent), not in good makeup(also well), but the story was compelling. Roman Polanski really knows how to make a film.

Finally, reviewer Poseidon-3 (""Virtually flawless piece of storytelling with Farrow's best work"", Poseidon-3 from Cincinnati, OH, 16 August 2005) has good background about the casting.*** <br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968, Roman Polanski﻿), a chronicle of the arrival of Satan's spawn conjured up by a witches coven﻿, is sublime. Polanski's film is an elite supernatural experience. With only two major scenes of genuine horror, most of the tension is building around moments, if removed from context, might otherwise seem banal. This is possibly why ""Rosemary's Baby"" has so much public appeal: It teases us by delaying the switch from the conventional to the surreal. Also, the central betrayal on display smacks harder because we are living with these characters.<br/><br/>Rosemary and her struggling actor husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavettes), move into a centrally-located, New York City﻿ apartment. (The building is the Dakota, where John Lennon﻿ later lived and was assassinated.) Guy's difficulty in getting his career established is postponing their intention to raise a family. While doing laundry, Rosemary makes friends with a recovering drug addict who also lives there thanks to the generosity of the Castevets, an elderly couple. The untimely demise of this laundry friend leads to Rosemary and Guy forming a relationship with Minnie and Roman Castevet. Rosemary finds the eccentric pair intrusive, particularly Minnie (who among other transgressions is always handing her mysterious concoctions to drink). Although he is initially reluctant to meet him, Guy immediately takes an interest with the worldly Roman (Sidney Blackmer). As Guy and Roman become close buddies the chief obstacle in Guy's acting career is suddenly removed. Tasting success, Guy and Rosemary decide the evening she is most fertile that it is time to create their baby. Minnie interrupts (yet again) by providing the couple a chocolate mousse. Rosemary doesn't like hers and shortly afterwards passes out. She then has a very odd nightmare where she is being raped by a demon while her husband and her neighbors watch. She wakes up, and imagines she has uncovered a Satanic conspiracy which involves everyone around her.<br/><br/>The dream sequence is incredible, one of cinema's best. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is great visually. Polanski superb color choices throughout. He blocks actors superbly. While never appearing staged, his mise en scène is very detailed. The result is uniquely watchable, and can only fully be appreciated in a movie house.<br/><br/>The cast, led by Mia Farrow as Rosemary, is excellent. Farrow deserved (but did not receive) Oscar recognition as the resilient young wife with a penchant for noticing small details. Farrow handles the task of conveying Rosemary's encroaching madness exceptionally well. She accomplishes this performance despite her real-life husband, Frank Sinatra, serving her with divorce papers which were delivered by a big-shot lawyer with the cast and crew observing. (Polanski offered her a day off to compose herself but Farrow gamely refused. The party scene where a crying Rosemary is on the kitchen floor being consoled by her friends was apparently filmed shortly after she was humiliated by Sinatra.) Another standout cast member is Ruth Gordon (who won an Oscar) as the scene-stealing Minnie Castevet. Minnie simply won't say no; she is the epitome of annoying friend who Rosemary knows she will never be able to get rid of. Sidney Blackmer as Roman is a very convincing Satanist. Ralph Bellamy is also effective as Dr. Sapirstein, a charismatic and manipulative physician who does not actually relieve Rosemary from the unusual, recurring pain of her pregnancy. Reviews are a bit mixed on John Cassavetes as Guy, with some complaining that he appears about 15 years older than his character. However, Cassavetes is a convincing betrayer. By the way, when Farrow phones the actor who had the role that suddenly fell in Guy's lap, she recognized but couldn't fully place the voice (Tony Curtis). Polanski kept the surprise from Farrow to bring out more confusion in her voice.<br/><br/>Cinephiles should wear a good luck pendant containing some musty (but charming) Tannis Root and head over to revival theater showing this to observe this exquisite horror classic unfold on the big screen."

You really feel for Rosemary as she starts to realize what is going on and tries to get away from her husband, then her doctor..And when Dr Hill turns her over to her original doctor and her husband and they hold her down sedating her, I found myself getting genuinely angry at them. And empathizing with Rose. And when a movie can make you feel genuine emotions, that its clearly a well made movie.

","If you look up any ""Top 25 Horror Movies of All Time"" lists, you are guaranteed to find 'Rosemary's Baby' on every single one of them. This 1968 classic takes on a subject that is already terrifying to most of us and makes it just that much worse. Rosemary is expecting and as her due date approaches, she knows that something is just not quite right. Roman Polanski brought a whole new kind of horror to the table that just wasn't that accessible at the time. Visionaries like Alfred Hitchcock, George A. Romero, and Polanski showed us that horror movies didn't need to just be about Frankenstein and Dracula. These men pulled horror out of the gutter and off the tail end of a joke and sparked a revolution that brought a legitimacy to the genre. Mia Farrow is perfect in this role. Her helplessness and innocence built up the suspense throughout the whole film until it was boiling over by the climax. Polanski gives us very good insight into the struggle of women's rights through this film as well. Farrow's character isn't able to think for herself. Much like Romero's main protagonist in 'Night of the Living Dead' (also made in the same year), both characters show how helpless women were made to feel back then and the struggle they had in just being able to voice their own opinion about something. If this film was made today, or remade, the inner struggle that Rosemary goes through wouldn't have the same impact as equality has strengthened the female vigor. However, if anyone could step into the shoes of Mia Farrow, it would be Gwyneth Paltrow. I do believe that she is this generations Farrow. It's ironic that Paltrow also starred in a Thriller in 1998 called 'Hush' in which she is pregnant and struggles with forces beyond her control. Paltrow was also born in 1971, so maybe she in fact Rosemary's baby. I loved this classic horror. I can't believe it took me this long to watch it. 9 out of 10."

Mia Farrow is shatteringly good, bringing you squarely into our orbit as the tortured wife married to the creep of all time. How any actor could survive the husband's part is anyone's guess but John Cassavetes manages it seems since his career apparently was helped by this showy part. But it is Mia Farrow's film alone and she is utterly captivating and utterly ravishing. You cannot take your eyes off her. She demands your attention in every single scene. The supporting cast is also very strong with Ruth Gordon being so annoying you really want to bag her. You know she's up to no good yet there's nothing poor Mia can do about it.

","The chalky under-taste in Rosemary's soufflé is the best way to describe the fear in Rosemary's Baby. In the 130 minute run-length, Roman Polanski sketches a story that could have been said in ninety minutes or even less. We know what will happen in the end way before Rosemary's confrontation itself, but we still follow Rosemary's abject situation intently because we have become attached to her and pitied by her condition. The most terrifying elements in the film do not call for creaking doors or vanishing figures, but use the most unpleasantly calm manner for inducing terror. The first haunting lullaby, with the piano keys connotes the mood of the film, and we know that this Doris Day movie-like sequence that follows will not remain this placid. <br/><br/>Rosemary, a bonny housewife and her husband Guy, a struggling actor move to a Gothic-inspired apartment in New York after marriage. The couple redecorates the place to suit their lifestyle since the house was previously occupied by an old lady who had died under mysterious circumstances. Soon, Rosemary befriends another lady in the laundry who lives with the Castevets, Rosemary's neighbors. But the girl is found one day lying on the pavement outside the building, she had apparently jumped to her death. This is when Rosemary and her husband get acquainted with the Castevets, who seem like a typical old couple, kind and helpful. Guy and Rosemary are invited to dinner where Guy has a private conversation with Roman Castevet until the ladies enter. Rosemary maintains her distance from the couple, especially the prying Minnie Castevet, who begins asking the price of her furniture; Guy however keeps visiting them often and seems quite preoccupied with 'work'. Rosemary, feeling alone and aloof, bites her tongue, fidgets, and then visits her doctor to share her woes with him. But the couple make up when Guy announces that they should have a baby, but maybe because of the half-eaten 'chocolate mousse with a chocolate under-taste', Rosemary feels enervated and faints. This is when her visions become all the be more surreal and puzzling, as Rosemary is not able to decipher whether it is a dream or it is really happening. Rosemary gets pregnant and informs this to Guy, who seems to be more relieved than excited and quickly, informs the Castevets. Rosemary, under the oldsters' suggestion or rather insistence, seeks help of a renowned doctor, Abraham Sapirstein, who in turn tells Rosemary to stop seeking advice from others, discontinue reading pregnancy books, and take a health drink prepared by Minnie, which is supposedly more effective than any goddamn pills. Rosemary undergoes a drastic weight-loss where she begins looking 'chalky' and her young friends begin worrying about her health. Apart from this, people begin dying or getting blinded or paralyzed under mysterious circumstances and Guy suddenly begins getting offers. Rosemary starts suspecting everyone around her and this leads to an unforgettable climax that you may have known beforehand but never expected to be like this.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby succeeds not just because of the fear that keeps looming at a distance, ready to strike us anytime, but also because of the ensemble's near brilliant effort at capturing the spook of homely horror- I don't know how else to describe it. The horror that is so close to home that Rosemary can see it coming but cannot help herself at getting away from it requires total unpretentiousness from the character's that establish this horror. This nosy hag Minnie and her striking husband Roman seem so unlikely to do any harm that when the truth is revealed, it brings double the chills than it would have with a long-haired, crazy looking couple with gaunt eyes and shaggy looks. Ruth Gordon is a gem, portraying her Minnie with tempered eccentricity while Sidney Blackmer is the perfect choice for Roman. John Cassavetes does his job well but could have explored his character more in terms of the guilt that Guy would have felt at committing the actions. The supporting cast is equally strong in keeping the movie alive but it is Mia Farrow, the disarmingly attractive model-actress who gives one of my favorite performances and probably one of the best of 1968. Her acting is not perfect, and neither does she pretend it is, but she is able to submit herself to her director and perform with instinct and understanding. Take the scene where she obtains the book on witches from Hutch and begins working on an anagram; you can see the excitement, tension and apprehension on her face – she wants Hutch to be wrong and the book being a hoax, but in the back of her mind, she knows that there is some connection between the book and her current situation. Mia does this and the rest of her scenes wonderfully; it's a shame the Oscars did not nominate her.<br/><br/>The DVD has bonus material, one that has the director, writer and producer of the film talking about their idea formation and decisions regarding the cast. There is not much information regarding technique as much of the runtime focuses on Mia and Roman (Polanski's) magical rapport. But we do see some behind the scenes footage, and we realize how flexible Roman is as a director. A random thought: It's funny whenever I think of the name Roman, I hear Nicki Minaj's 'Roman Holiday' in my head; Roman Zolanski had his exorcism on the Grammy's recently while Roman Castevets brought the devil's son Adrian to the world in 1966 Year 1. Roman Polanski on the other hand is battling some very serious allegations in USA. <br/><br/>Discard The Woman in Black, throw away Paranormal Activity 2, and ditch Grudge; Rosemary's Baby is watch you should be watching.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.5 out of 10"

","Rosemary's Baby In my opinion, this movie doesn't suffice to call ""Rosemary's Baby"" a horror film; that implies something corny. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is anything but corny. It is actually creepy. The plot of course and different scenes of this movie have weak-looking Rosemary Woodhouse getting pregnant and discovering that the father is Satan; Rosemary's husband Guy is colluding with Satan's beliefs neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet so that he can get a part in a play. Everything looks normal, but as the story progresses, you begin to get the feeling that something's not right, and then you find out the horrible truth.<br/><br/>Most notable of course are the character portrayals, and those many special moments one immediately realizes were created not to drive the story, further the potential success of the movie or the fame of anybody involved, but to plainly create atmosphere and entertain us. Rosemary's Baby is an extraordinary picture in that it conveys so much information, it illustrates so much of its motive, and makes anxious its truths long before Rosemary knows them herself, but yet somehow it can fill a viewer with constant and complete suspense. And Rosemary's predicament isn't exactly something new in the realm of storytelling; in fact it's formulaic in many ways. When you go into a film knowing it's supposed to be horrific, but are not given any strong shocks or scares for almost the first hour – that alone creates tension to me. But it is this particular fact about Rosemary's Baby that makes many question its 'horror movie' standing."
"Eumenides_0","10","1","3","14 February 2010"," Madness and the Devil
","Roman Polanski's classic Rosemary's Baby remains not only one of the best horror thrillers I've ever seen, but one of the greatest movies. In the horror genre, one needs to watch The Exorcist to come across a movie that matches the quality of Polanski's masterwork. The more one peers into the past, the more one comes across good horror movies. For all their tameness by modern standards, the truth is these classics are better written, plotted, acted, paced and scored.<br/><br/>The story is by now universally known, having seeped into popular consciousness in all sorts of parodies, homages, spoofs and imitations. Let it just be said that the use of demons and the Devil has seldom been so well used in cinema. Again, one must watch The Exorcist, or perhaps its knock-off The Omen, to see it so it used with novelty and artistic quality.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow plays Rosemary in a very seductive way, that makes it impossible for the viewer not to sympathise with her from the start. She's such a good-natured, happy woman that it's more tragic when she becomes the target of evil forces trying to control her and her pregnancy. John Cassavetes plays her husband, Guy, an apparently average joe, who's darker than she ever imagined. Ruth Gordon plays a chattering, busybody neighbor, a seemingly harmless old lady, secretly scheming against the innocent Rosemary.<br/><br/>Polanski was at the top of his game in 1968 and directed this movie in a very elegant and innovative way. For instance, the movie is bright and colorful. When Rosemary and Guy arrive at their new apartment in the Bramford building, it's a desolate, sinister place, evocative of countless haunted houses of the past. But then they remodel it and it becomes a light, pleasant place to live in. This is one of the many departures from old movies, the idea that horror can happen in the most mundane places, by the most vulgar people.<br/><br/>The score is harmonious and peaceful, with a lullaby as the main theme; it's a far cry from the distorted garbage that poisons so many horror movies today. Rather than highlighting the tension, it lulls the viewer into a sense of peace and safety. It's wonderfully manipulative, as horror should be.<br/><br/>The story develops at a rational place, slowly building on the strangeness around Rosemary, introducing her to a secret world that isolates her from any help. Rosemary grows more helpless as the movie goes on, and it's a joy to watch Farrow descend into terror and despair little by little. I think this was a major improvement on his previous movie, Repulsion, in which Catherine Deneuve's character always seemed a bit crazy from the start.<br/><br/>Although Polanski reached the zenith of film-making with Chinatown, that perfect gem of cinema, Rosemary's Baby stands as one of his best efforts and remains enjoyable and innovative after several decades."
"blanche-2","10","1","3","19 January 2010"," Brilliant Polanski film
","No matter how one feels about Roman Polanski's personal life, one has to admit he has moments - sometimes days and months - of sheer genius. 1968's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is one example. A psychological horror film, Polanski depends on the power of suggestion and elements of mystery to build the story, which is very faithful to Ira Levin's novel.<br/><br/>It's very hard to write a review from the perspective of someone who has just seen Rosemary's Baby for the first time and has never read the book. I've seen it countless times, so I can't remember now what I thought originally. But a first-time viewer, I guess, wouldn't actually know whether Rosemary was paranoid and hysterical or, in fact, if there are really strange goings-on. This makes the story all the more potent.<br/><br/>In the book, Rosemary isn't the frail-looking woman that Mia Farrow is, but Farrow is perfect as the fragile, passive Rosemary. Cassavetes as her actor-husband does all the actor-y things of imitating different people, etc., and is great. Of course, Ruth Gordon is a standout as nosy Minnie Castevet, every mannerism, from looking at a soup can label to dropping by with chocolate mousse, is fantastic, and she deservedly won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her performance. Polanski called on a cast of experienced stars for the supporting roles: besides Gordon, there is Maurice Evans, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Bellamy, Patsy Kelly, and Elisha Cook, Jr. Tony Curtis is the voice of the unfortunate actor whom Guy replaces on Broadway.<br/><br/>Polanski sets up a compelling tale of religious conflict, ambition, terror, and isolation with the backdrop of New York City and the exterior of the famous Dakota (where John Lennon was killed) as the infamous building where Rosemary, Guy, and the Castevets live.<br/><br/>For those who are interested, Ira Levin wrote a sequel to this, ""Rosemary's Boy,"" I believe, that takes place in 1999. But for my money, nothing could ever beat ""Rosemary's Baby."""
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","1","3","17 January 2010"," Bathed in a creepy, brooding atmosphere. See it!
","Is the occult enough to frighten us in this day and age? Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen may all be considered classics, but after all we've seen in real life since those films were made can the occult really still frighten us? Since the 1970s we've lived through wars, endless terrorist attacks, serial killers more gruesome than any Hollywood writer could imagine, you name it. So can someone just sit down and view a movie like Rosemary's Baby and be frightened by it? The answer is a definitive YES.<br/><br/>I had seen parts of this before, but never the conclusion until sitting down and taking it all in the other evening. Though very heavily dated in terms of just about everything you'll see, Rosemary's Baby is still very suspenseful and just downright eerie. In the tradition of great horror films before it and a few since, this movie doesn't rely on buckets of blood, severed limbs, or cheap shocks when someone or something jumps into the frame. This one has a compelling story, and it lets its atmosphere smother the viewer in a cloud of doom and desperation. The story deals with a young couple moving into an old but stately apartment building on the Upper West Side of New York City. It is clear from the get-go that the other tenants of this building are just not right in many ways. Particularly the elderly couple next door as they have soon insinuated themselves into the young couple's lives in every way possible. After a while, the young woman finds herself pregnant, and things pretty much go downhill from there for her. By all means watch this film to experience the particulars for yourself.<br/><br/>The writing, acting, directing and production design are top notch. Polanski was only getting started at this point, but still this is one of his best efforts. As the conclusion was approaching, there were three logical ways I expected this film to end. They chose my second ending. The first would have been the obvious choice of having Rosemary jump out a window to her death like the young woman earlier in the film. The third choice would have been for Rosemary to use the knife to stab the infant to death. But that would have been maybe too macabre. I think they made a good choice, but I don't really want to see the sequel which has nothing but poor reviews and was made by inferior talent. 9 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

"dfle3","6","1","3","3 June 2008"," Dated, but of historical curiosity
","I saw this movie a few years back and I just want to note something that I found intriguing about it. Before that, however, I'll just provide a brief synopsis of the plot: a newly married couple move into a town-house & prepare for the birth of their new child. An element of surreality does enter into the equation & I suppose part of of hook of the movie is wondering whether the wife's paranoia about her unborn child's nature is well founded or hysterical. In the movie, there are hints that her circumstances are a vast conspiracy-involving her husband, neighbours and...Satan!<br/><br/>One thing that this movie did clear up, was the question of what inspired the ""Tupperware witches"" sketches in the Australian sketch comedy show ""Fast Forward"". I think that this movie may have been the source of these sketches!<br/><br/>Interestingly, an SBS TV (Australia) documentary in September 07 entitled ""The history of the Devil"" mentioned this movie too, along with another movie that I've reviewed here, The Exorcist. I'll mention those points below, but first a warning...the comments below are spoilers, to a lesser or greater extent. Maybe read the stuff below after you've watched the movie.<br/><br/>Potential spoilers: In the documentary above, The Exorcist is described as a Christian fightback to this movie, in that in Rosemary's Baby, the Devil triumphs. The Exorcist sees Good triumphing over Evil.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is described as a product of the counter-cultural movement during the Vietnam War in the 1960's, a time when The Establishment (Government, Capitalism and Religion) were viewed with suspicion and hostility. During this time, Satanism was seen by some as an antidote to The Establishment.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wasn't overly impressed with this movie. It's OK. what I did find intriguing was the implication that God did a poor job designing humans. In the metaphysical conflict between Good and Evil, God seems to have made a monumental mistake in allowing a woman's maternal instinct to over-ride eternal consequences."

","the most successful trick employed in all of 'rosemary's baby' is in polanski's decision to not show the viewer exactly what has happened to rosemary's newborn baby's eyes. when she walks in and finds that her neighbors have kidnapped/bought from husband her newborn child instead of hiding it, rosemary is allowed to go to her baby and pick it up. lifting the child up in her arms, rosemary looks down and begins to scream, 'his eyes, what have you done to his eyes' as the movie ends. i love that we have no idea exactly what was done. maybe they were removed and she is staring down at the empty hollow sockets in her child's face? maybe they are hideously deformed, or cat shaped with sharp oval-shaped pupils? not showing allows the viewer to speculate and to tap into what it is terrifies them most, not be shown someone else's fear in the hopes it registers with them."
"ladysatan198666","10","1","3","29 November 2004"," THIS will make you NEVER want kids
","Rosemary's baby is downright creepy.Mia Farrow plays a frail woman who unknowingly becomes the woman who will bear Satan's kid. And she finds out only when it's too late... I was disgusted when I first saw it, but a second watch made me see it's brilliance. The whole movie has a creepy, suspicious atmosphere,which puts you in the same scared place as Rosemary.None of the characters in this movie are the stereotypical ""EVIL"" characters which can be pointed out right away,there's no mise-en-scene to point out 'scary place!' for the audience. You really feel like there is no one you can trust, which is why this movie is so scary.<br/><br/>The movie is also a good comment on a Catholic upbringing's effect on women. Rosemary is devout and goes along with what the Church and men say is best and right. A subtle hint is the fact that she uses the calender method, which is known to be very risky and unreliable. The best example comes with her submission during her pregnancy- It's 'take the pill, don't ask questions,don't worry your pretty head'. her dream also implies that the church considers you a sinner if you are raped. But whatever- I was scarred by my catholic upbringing.<br/><br/>The best part about this film is the end. Rosemary has the baby, only to have it taken away by the satanists. But she accepts the child, thinking that god will triumph, and that she can change her child's fate. It attacks religion and motherhood in one blow. But evil wins, and that's refreshing for a movie."

","I watched this older horror movie with an open mind, knowing already it was very popular in years past, a bit before my time though, yet I found the movie interesting and easy to watch, especially as Mia Farrow, thin and quite sexy, holds her own as a great actress.<br/><br/>She was just 22 years old in this movie and that was back in 1968. Not bad acting for a girl so young. <br/><br/>Anyway, the suspense builds up very slowly and by the time Mia chops off her cute hairdo for that dreadful reddish looking butch style hair cut, the story darkens as her suspicion grows about the strange neighbors next door. <br/><br/>Mia's dream sequences, caused by drinking the neighbors concoction seemed more like a sixties style LSD trip then anything else. That was all cool and so was the surprising nude scenes that I didn't think they did back in these kinds of 1968 movies. I hope more people watch this great suspense, its a real classic.<br/><br/>This movie really surprised me, in lots of ways. I gave it a good rating of 8/10."
"canadude","10","1","3","9 July 2004"," What is a horror film?
","It's really ironic that ""Rosemary's Baby"" is so often cited as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Because, when you watch it, it doesn't really share much with what many consider horror films. There is not one menacing villain versus several main characters, of which those with faults succumb to grisly deaths, while those with virtues survive to the end. In fact, there is hardly any violence, or even scenes of immediate tension, such as those when a victim hides out in some dark area, isolated from the rest of humanity, with no weapon, while a violent, supernatural murderer haunts (usually her) the victim. The horror in this type of horror film is of course short-lived and short-lasting. Thus, a modern horror film generally comprises several such scenes where the tension is permitted to artificially rise and then is released when the violence occurs. I say ""artificial"" because the formula is so known to the audience that the audience members can practically predict where the tension will rise, though they may still experience it. The tension in modern horror is formulaic and often constructed out of absurd situations.<br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby,"" Polanski's first American film, is different. It is the story of one, fragile individual who, at her most vulnerable (during her pregnancy), descends into psychological hell. The tension here is absolutely real, even though the premise is absurd. (The premise, by the way, is that Rosemary's husband agrees to let his wife be host to the son of Satan in exchange for a successful career). However, the realism of the general premise is absolutely unnecessary for the film to work, precisely because it is psychological.<br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" begins like a bad romance film. A couple buys an apartment, chats with the neighbors and talks of making a baby. Then, Rosemary, in a nightmarish vision gets impregnated and things start to go wrong. She has dreams though she feels they are real. Her neighbors persuade her to switch to another doctor, one who ignores her complaints about the pain she feels. She finds mysterious scratches on her arms. A friend who had something important to tell her ends up dead. She hears voices and slowly, but surely, the coincidences start to add up in her head. They form a *believable* reality - and the reason it is believable is because we follow Rosemary's logic and fears. We can't help but draw the same, terrifying conclusions.<br/><br/>Thus, ""Rosemary's Baby"" terrifies precisely because it makes an absurdly-horrific situation believable and genuinely upsetting. A lot of factors, of course, aside from the story make this work. No doubt, Polanski's expert direction helps visually and psychologically construct a claustrophobic, alienating and alien world. John Cassevetes is great as Rosemary's husband, Guy, who's masculine innocence carries dark undertones. And Mia Farrow, or Rosemary, is the perfect victim for this little scheme - innocent, naive, steadily growing more exhausted, more paranoid, Farrow plays Rosemary perfectly. And, without Rosemary's believable psychological reaction to the events unfolding around her, the film would lose half its strength.<br/><br/>In ""Rosemary's Baby"" Polanski explores some of the themes that would preoccupy him for the rest of his directorial career. The idea of alienation, de-humanization and schizophrenia (the ultimate psychological fracture and collapse) in the face of a gradual advent of evil is the central theme in the story. Rosemary's environment, for reasons unknown to her, becomes inimical and harmful and she is helpless in the face of it. And it happens so gradually and subtly, it's easy to forget that everything used to be peaceful in the beginning.<br/><br/>Upon a third viewing (I believe) Polanski's direction still appears expert. However, I realized that ""Rosemary's Baby"" is simply extremely well-made pulp. It's at the top of the pulpy scale and it almost approaches art, but not quite - ""Chinatown,"" however, does. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a film about paranoia and perhaps feminism, but it doesn't come close to the existential horror of ""Chinatown.""<br/><br/>And it isn't Polanski's most terrifying pulpy horror. I do put it above ""Repulsion"" of which I was never a fan, but ""Rosemary's Baby"" pales in comparison to a much darker, later film, ""The Tenant."" ""The Tenant"" stars Polanski himself and is a story not unlike the story of Rosemary. A man rents an apartment in Paris and things around him go very wrong - the apartment, Paris and humanity turn against him. He is a victim of circumstance, coincidence, much like Rosemary, but the ambiguity of ""The Tenant"" leaves far more terrifying implications. It leaves the viewer wondering whether the tenant is actually sane and whether what he witnesses is real or only a schizophrenic hallucination. ""Rosemary's Baby"" has similarly ambiguous elements, but I think the question of Rosemary's sanity isn't as central to the film as the change of her physical and psychological reality. <br/><br/>But in ""The Tenant"" you never really do know. Whether the tenant is sane. Whether you're sane and what sanity is anyway. It's all stripped to terrifying darkness, in which you can't see anything. And that darkness, losing one's mind, is far more terrifying, and realistic, than giving birth to Satan's child."
"jasa-3","9","1","3","8 July 2004"," Skillful Horror
","Roman Polanski has used very skillfully methods to make a creepy horror film. Excluding the ending of the film, Rosemary's Baby reminded me of Hitchcock's brilliant horror and thriller films. But I should watch this movie twice because after just one view of the film I can't think of anything lousy in this film. And no film is perfect.<br/><br/>But as I mentioned, I have watched this film only once, so I have only good things to say about this movie. So: the actors and actresses are great. I like movies which don't have dozens of characters. This movie hasn't got too many characters. When there are only few characters it is easy to learn to know them better. I liked especially Mia Farrow. She was great. Also the title music was fantastic!<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby shows how to make a good horror film, without any cool special effects. Many movies have been spoiled with too many effects so I'm glad this one is made in the 60s when it was impossible to make decent effects, at least compared to what you can do nowadays. Well, I don't want to write all day. I gave this movie 9/10 points and recommend it to everyone who likes Hitchcock-movies."

","(Warning: contains spoilers)	 	Rosemary's Baby is the kind of film that no one really needs to see because with all the notoriety that has come with it over the years we just assume it is good without ever really knowing. 	If I would have saw it during the year of 1968, when it was first released, I may have given it praise of the utmost standard. Focusing my thoughts on its firm analysis of paranoia and how it walls people into situations where the only ones who seem safe from its effects are the audience. I also would have talked about Mia Farrow's career making performance and director Roman Polanski's ability to present motions of fear without the use of blood. But it is not the kind of movie that ages well with admiration. These days we know its secrets, and since we expect them, it's more common to find yourself waiting than actually watching with anticipation, and as Hitchcock once said `there is no terror in a bang, only in the anticipation of it.' 	Rosemary's Baby opens its thoughts in grand old horror movie fashion, with an idea that has very little to do with the rest of the story. In the Exorcist it was an archaeological dig. Here it is the mysterious death of a recently befriended neighbour. I'll admit, for the most part, this scene did have intentions of leading the audience somewhere with ideas of fear, confusion and paranoia. But in a film where we already know something is up, the mystery lies in when the character will finally realize it too. 	In general, Rosemary's Baby focuses on a young couple in Rosemary and Guy, who should have realized that moving into their new apartment was an unwise decision when they find a cabinet that is blocking what appears to be a seemingly normal closet. 	The film then presents a scene, obligatory by today's standards, where the couple is warned about the apartment building's wicked past from a friend who believes in witchcraft and the such. This character is necessary to the film because were it not to believe in its own sense of evil than the idea that no one can be trusted would be lost inside itself. Yet, even in necessity, two problems arise. The first being that if it is a close friend who gives reason for the main character to have feelings of untruth, how can he be trusted even though we already know he is a decent character? 	The other problem comes from a statement that I made in my review for the Recruit. I said that I was not a fan of the `trust no one' approach to writing. With that film I made an exception because `in turn it didnt know itself very well.` Here, writer Polanski knows where he wants to go and I like it even less because it is already suspected why characters can't be trusted. 	With the intention of conceiving their first child, Rosemary and Guy have a truly strange sex scene/dream sequence where it appears that Rosemary is making love to the devil himself? That scene is one of two dream sequences. The first being unsolicited and unexplainable. I suspect it to be a set-up for the future, so that when the second comes along we are ready for it in hopes of an explanation. 	Alas, Rosemary becomes pregnant, but at the expense of her own tainted psyche. Now everything seems strange to her. Her husband is always away and her neighbours are a little too nice for comfort. She isn't gaining any weight and is having constant chest pains, but her new doctor assures her that everything is okay and to just keep receiving the care given by her lovely neighbours. Things become even more confusing for Rosemary when Hutch, the friend, falls into a coma and dies soon after. 	Now Rosemary takes no chances and begins buying books on witchcraft and studies satanic cults. From this she gathers reason to believe that her neighbour is the descendant of a witch and her husband has promised their baby to him in an act representing the second coming of Satan in human form. She's right... the end. 	The biggest flaw that Rosemary's Baby put upon itself is that it confined its paranoia to the central purpose of one character. In pushing everyone else to the sidelines, Polanski makes it no challenge to determine the good from the evil. For when only one character has a reason to fear for herself, the audience outweighs the possibility of innocence in any other characters.<br/><br/>	There is no doubt that Polanski is a good director, but he has done better. A lot better. He offers no memorable scenes or dialogue. What is, just is. In that sense, I suppose that Rosemary's Baby may not be a bad movie, just an overrated one. Or maybe I missed my mark entirely while watching it. Still it is anything but Polanski's masterpiece. In his lack of thought and abundance for  feeling we are made digest an awkward balance of predictability and unfocused half-truths. 	Mia Farrow stars as Rosemary, in a confident performance. She runs, she screams and she looks concerned a lot. It's standard horror fare but Farrow sells it by  never once leading us to believe that the world isn't against her. The thing that diverts the focus from the good acting is the fact that Polanski is more concerned with how his characters react to his ideas and not how they exists within their own environment. With this I find it hard to decide whether I should be giving Farrow credit for her performance or taking it away for the directors selfish neglect for everything but his vision. 	Some will probably debate that I may have given away too much of the story to those who still wish to see Rosemary's Baby. But in contradiction to that, I have already stated that this is a film that no one really needs to see. So why bother?"

While there's an arguably slow beginning, you can tell there's a sense of dread in the air, and once the scary parts start, you're buckled in for a non-stop horror fest until the end.<br/><br/>If you like horror movies, you might not be very fazed by this one. But keep in mind, in 1968, Rosemary's Baby was a really big deal. For lightweights, like me, you'll be really spooked by this cult favorite. I only sat through this one because I like Mia Farrow so much.<br/><br/>Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, this is a horror movie and way too scary for kids, Also, there may or may not be a rape scene, so I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

","If there were ever a film that conveyed just about everything we'd like to leave behind from the 1960s, it's Rosemary's Baby. Discussed in furtive, worried whispers by older generations, and the 'can we watch it?' controversy in the wake of director Roman Polanski's legendary sexual scandal, the film has, through the decades, become enshrouded with the sort of titillating rebellious intrigue of sneaking into an R-rated movie under-age. The final product is hardly what you'd expect: a creeping psychological thriller that leaves most of its horror tropes offscreen, Polanski's film is more of an uncompromisingly caustic social satire, and is all the scarier for it. <br/><br/>It's a horror movie more in terms of gender politics than Satanic shenanigans, replete with some of cinema's most grotesque gaslighting, sleep-rape (distressingly laughed off in a further feat of 'oh the '60s' predatory patriarchy), and effective spousal prostitution, made all the ickier by the predatory shroud of its director. Scene by scene, flustered, passive Rosemary (Mia Farrow) is practically passed around like an eponymous joint by her vain, controlling actor husband (the sickeningly charming John Cassavetes), and their intrusively extroverted upstairs neighbours (the show-stealing, boorishly hysterical Ruth Gordon, gleefully stretching her syllables like a Looney Tunes character, and the pleasantly measured Sidney Blackmer), near-speechless as they backseat drive her social outings, sex life, home decor, fashion, food and drink consumption, and, particularly pregnancy.* When Rosemary makes one decidedly autonomous action, coming home with a trendy pixie cut, she's jokingly chided as irresponsibly impulsive, and unattractively boyish. Farrow is superb, commanding each scene with such an off-kilter, cheery charm that it's heartbreaking to see it inevitably extinguished, and perfectly essaying Rosemary's descent from her initial demure passivity into manic, bug-eyed, knife-wielding frenzy. It's tempting to write the film off as Polanski's patriarchal posturing, were it not for his subtly satirical undercurrent of critique. He drinks in each social faux-pas with a grotesque lack of hyperbole, colouring them as unforgivable (but, also, uncomfortably culturally common) with the wryest, jet-black sense of humour. Rosemary's Baby is, in essence, less a tale of the Antichrist than a scathing condemnation of the hellish people already inhabiting the planet. 
 
It's also effectively spooky, albeit predicated more on a (slightly less contemporary) steadily creeping sense of dread, with jump scares less common than surrealist dream sequences and teasingly vague political and religious critiques ensconced in acid trip sexual fantasies. Proceedings begin with an almost eerily sluggish pace, but Polanski mounts tension with Hitchcockian dedication (albeit with a touch less poise), playing each almost imperceptible sound and dialogue from the adjacent apartment as a source of ambiguously immeasurable threat. He's so singularly committed to snowballing into the film's fatalistic climax that it's easy to forget the film's airy, bourgeois openings in the thick of the frenzied, nail-biting suspense that comes. <br/><br/>Still, Polanski's cruellest joke is transforming us, the viewer, into the proverbial Judas, where we nearly start to turn on Rosemary as well. Polanski's taut editing and clever script keep things so teasingly ambiguous that we're (nearly) coerced into joining in the film's satirically antifeminist bent, anticipating all of the cultist conspiracy, lies, and murder turn out to be a product of her paranoiac overactive imagination - or worse: hysteria, or a bout of prepartum psychosis. The real twist? Things are exactly as they seem, delivering an unforgettably climax primed with chilling gothic fervour, and the darkest of humour - none moreso than in the final, haunting shot of Farrow's sphinx-like smile. <br/><br/>Time is less kind to Rosemary's Baby than other films of its ilk, as the garish sexual politics, benign scare tactics and initial snail's pace all war for the most antiquated of attributes. What is, sadly, timeless is the film's searing critical commentary of the beastliness of people, from the imbedded micromanagement of women's actions and behaviours, to the dark depths that people will stoop in the name of personal gratification. In terms of cinematic mission statement, Polanski seems to draw as much from the Bard as from novelist Ira Levin: ""Hell is open, and all the devils are here!"" <br/><br/>-8/10 <br/><br/>

","Having seen this film when it first came out, I wondered if I would react the same way seeing it again. Well, the answer is I did. This film is one of the most terrifying I've ever seen. Mia Farrow is the innocent woman who moves in with her husband, John Cassevetes. They have a group of neighbors who seem wonderful. They approach her in a kindly fashion. They support her in her day to day life, offering help to her. They feel it is time to have a baby and then the fear starts. One night she has a dream encounter with something that appears to be Satanic. Soon she starts to have cravings that she can't explain and odd things begin to happen in the apartment building. Soon, it is obvious, that the upcoming birth is of great interest to one truly evil people. There is so much more. Suffice it to say, the suspense built up and acted out is exciting."

","The recently deceased Ira Levin was an estimable writer of commercial entertainments, with enough role distance to be able to make jokes about his own work. Like Stephen King, he larded his pages with references to consumer products and familiar names. In the novel Victoria Gionoffrio looked exactly like Audrey Hepburn, not some fictional actress.<br/><br/>Here, Levin has written an almost perfect woman-in-jeopardy film that, had it not had the performers, director, and production values of a feature film, would have fit neatly into the sort of template that leaps out at a view from an LMN movie. ""Where's my BABY?"", Rosemary Woodhouse screams towards the end.<br/><br/>Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy (John Cassavetes), an upwardly mobile young couple in New York, rent an apartment in a building haunted by its violent and mysterious past. Guy is an actor, limited to unimportant roles, until his rival for an important part is suddenly struck blind and Guy gets the part he's been praying for. His turn of fortune may have had something to do with their somewhat odd but unpretentious neighbors, especially the Castavets, Sidney Blackmer and the amusingly dotty Ruth Gordon. In fact, as it develops, his good luck owed everything to them. Cassavetes has achieved his goal by selling his wife as a vehicle for the conception, gestation, and birth of the child of Satan. The pregnancy is really bizarre too, involving magic potions prepared by Gordon, and the conniving of a celebrity Ob-Gyn doc (Ralph Bellamy) who is in on the plot.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow gradually twigs to the plan and tries to escape, but her every attempt is blocked. We want things to turn out well for her and her baby, of course, but, as is usual with Roman Polanski, the ending is sad. More than sad, actually. ""The son of Satan is born and will lay waste to the world!"" shouts an ecstatic Blackmer. Right. The formula calls for a perceptive young man who is a friend, hopelessly in love with Farrow, to catch on and come to her rescue at the last minute, sort of like Hutch (Maurice Evans), but it doesn't happen here.<br/><br/>The movie is about as well done as these horror fantasies get. All of the principle actors are splendid. And nobody could have embodied the threatened mother-to-be better than the waif-like Mia Farrow. She's skinny and beautiful to begin with. But as her pregnancy progresses and she suffers severe and continuous pain, and after she has a prison haircut, and after she loses still more weight, she becomes positively hebemorphic and afflicted with raccoon eyes. The fetus may be flourishing but she looks as if she's about to waste away to nothing. She wobbles as she walks, looking barely able to hold herself upright.<br/><br/>Polanski's direction is impeccable and so is the production design. And we have to mention the wardrobe department too. No one with more hideous outfits than Ruth Gordon's has been on the screen for a generation before and after the release of this movie. I guess there is one weak scene. In desperation, Farrow visits her original obstetrician (Charles Grodin) and tells him about her entrapment. But, in a scene that we remember from dozens of similar movies, she tries to spill the beans to the attentive Grodin all at once, and the information comes out stumbling all over itself, pile upon pile of non sequiturs and paranoid-sounding arguments. She doesn't sound trapped. She sounds nuts.<br/><br/>Anyway, a good job by all concerned"

","Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes), a struggling actor, move into what would seem to be the perfect apartment in New York City. Things seem to be going well for Rosemary; she meets some new friends in Roman and Minnie Castavet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) though she does find Minnie a tad annoying at times, her husband's career starts to take off even though as a result of a fellow actor's ill-fortune and on top of it all, Rosemary becomes pregnant much to her delight. However, Rosemary eventually starts to suspect that all is not what it seems and rapidly starts to believe that there is a fiendish plot against her, and her unborn baby.<br/><br/>This movie, adapted from a novel by Ira Levin, was Roman Polanski's first American film and arguably one of his best. There is a certain intelligence to Rosemary's Baby' that is rarely found in a horror movie. Polanski is able to gradually call the audience's attention to the horror in the movie, instead of throwing it in our faces. Whereas other classic religious horrors such as The Exorcist' (1973) climaxed, if you will, part way through and then sought to underline the horror with multiple shocking sequences, this movie is different, in Rosemary's Baby' there is no real climax. Instead we have a gradual realisation of the truth developed wonderfully through some great direction and a remarkably strong screenplay (written by Polanski). While there can be no doubt in the audiences mind that something is indeed amiss, the feelings of fear are generated simply by the unknown. There are so many things that can lead you to a conclusion, but until the final twenty minutes there is no indication as to why these things are happening. Astonishingly the movie lasts in excess of two hours and yet does not feel as if it is dragging once. The opening fifteen minutes may cause the viewer to question where the movie is heading but after that Rosemary's Baby' becomes one of the most enchanting and engrossing horror movies ever made. Polanski created some rather disturbing nightmare sequences early on in the movie which mark the beginning of Rosemary's nightmare but are far from the end.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow was nominated for a Golden Globe award for her performance, and quite rightly so. Farrow's portrayal of the helpless mother desperately seeking to protect her unborn child is powerfully emotional. Ruth Gordon also put in a splendid (and Oscar-winning!) performance as the creepy character of Minnie. Gordon's performance gave an enormous realism to her character and portrayed her as being strange, but not in a necessarily evil way. Minnie's busy-body persona comes across as just that, a busy-body persona. The way Gordon plays her character shows an incredible tangency with similar people in the real world. Sidney Blackmer was also impressive as Minnie's husband. He portrayed the character as a kindly elderly man, so much so that during the final scenes his comments about the situation almost come across as making sense. The dying moments of the film are certainly dramatic as Polanski is able to play on maternal nature to finalise the horror aspect. The closing scene has an exceptionally eerie tranquillity to it and the viewer is left with a very strong thought in their mind. Undoubtedly, Rosemary's Baby' has one of the greatest endings in horror history and purposely fails to answer every question, which leaves the viewer to make their own mind up. The film's tangency with the real world, even though the movie's premise itself is somewhat absurd, allows for a rather chilling finale as the viewer is forced to ask - `what next?'  and only the viewer can answer the question. In some ways the cryptic ending of Rosemary's Baby' is one of its finest accomplishments.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby' is one of the finest horror movies in the history of cinema and I highly recommend it to everyone. The movie is paced very well, impressively acted, strikingly scripted and very entertaining. This is not a particular bloody movie but maintains a sinister atmosphere throughout and the nightmare sequences are some of the most powerful I have seen. My rating for Rosemary's Baby'  9/10."

I loved one thing in the movie that is movie's music. I think that this movie is only waste of time. Plot:Rosemary is a young housewife and Guy is her husband. He is an actor. They move an apartment building. Their neighbors, Minnie and Roman are old and so interesting couple. Guy has a role in a play when the actor who had been originally cast suddenly goes blind. Guy suggests that he and Rosemary have the child. On the night they planned to try to conceive, Minnie brings them a dessert. After eating Rosemary has a stomach ache and passes out. Rosemary has a strange dream in which there is a group of naked persons in their bedroom and then she is raped by a demon. The dream is almost real. When she wakes, she finds scratches on her body, and her husband admits that he had intercourse with her while she was unconscious because he didn't want to pass up the moment for her to conceive. A few weeks later, Rosemary learns she is pregnant. Minnie and Roman recommended to her see their good friend, famed Dr. Abraham Sapirstein. For the first three months of her pregnancy, Rosemary suffers pains, loses weight, becomes pale and she starts to eat raw meat and chicken liver. The doctor says the pain is normal and there is nothing to worry about. When her old friend Edward Hutch sees Rosemary's thin appearance plans to share his findings with her but he mysteriously falls into a coma a few hours before their meeting, and dies three months later. Before his death, he has instructed the doctor to have a book about witchcraft be given to Rosemary. His friend gives the book to Rosemary. Rosemary suspects her neighbors and Dr. Sapirstein. Guy is cooperating with them in exchange for their help in advancing his career. Rosemary escapes but his wife and Roman pursue her to the apartment, where Rosemary locks the door. She is sedated by Dr. Sapirstein and when she awakens, she is told the baby died. But when she hears a baby's cries in the building, she suspects he is still alive. Rosemary discovers a secret door leading into the Castevet apartment. And she finds the meeting for her newborn son. But the baby is so different than the other babies. Rosemary understands Guy is not the baby's father. Roman urges Rosemary to become a mother to her son. The film ends with her adjusting her son's blankets."

"Red-Barracuda","9","1","5","23 May 2018"," An elegant and sophisticated example of screen horror
","This was acclaimed Polish director Roman Polanski's first American movie. It was produced by famed horror director William Castle, who was an odd bed fellow for Polanski but it turned out to be a marriage made in heaven (or hell) as Rosemary's Baby turned out to be one of the films that truly brought the horror genre into the modern age. Like the later film The Stepford Wives (1975), which was also about a woman in a new environment unsure if she is being terrorised by her odd new neighbours, this one was a novel by Ira Levin. Set in super-chic Manhattan, it tells of a young woman who falls pregnant and becomes convinced that her neighbours are a group of Satanists who are trying to control the birth. There's more to it than that but either you know it or you don't need to read it and just see it.<br/><br/>Like Polanski's earlier Repulsion (1965) and later The Tenant (1976) this one follows the somewhat specific template which could allow it to be labelled an apartment horror. In all those films the central protagonist finds themselves a prisoner of sorts in their home. In this example the action is shot on location at New York's Dakota Building, which became forever infamous some time later as the place John Lennon was murdered. Polanski conjures up a truly modern type of horror where the absurd seems deeply plausible, where Satanists knit sweaters and appear completely unthreatening on the surface. In fact, aside from a disturbing dream sequence where Satan rapes Rosemary, the chills in this one are all of the subtle variety, with the fear being what is just out of reach and out of sight; felt but not seen. It also naturally plays on the universal fear of childbirth and the subjugation of women; which must have been extra pertinent in the late 60's times of change. Polanski is the key contributor of course but he is assisted massively by the stellar cast. Mia Farrow is thoroughly compelling in the central role as the vulnerable Rosemary who is in every single scene, John Cassavetes is extremely shifty and creepy as her husband who has made a Faustian pact with the Satanists, while Sidney Blackmer and (especially) Ruth Gordon are simply brilliant as the elderly cult leaders.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby was and remains, a towering entry in the horror genre. It was the film whose success ushered in the trend for big budget satanic themed horror movies throughout the 70's, with both The Exorcist (1973) and the Omen (1976) owing some obvious debt to it. Overall, a brilliant achievement."

But the problem is to call this movie a horror movie. There are horror elements but they are too weak, too few, The movie is submerged with too much realism for a witchcraft and horror standard, do not forget that this is a movie about witchcraft and the supernatural elements are too weak, the movie sounds more like a drama, too often.

","I just saw Rosemary's Baby from beginning to end after not having seen the film from what I can recollect as more than seventeen years. When the singing started in the beginning of the film, I found it quite reminiscent. For some reason I thought someone I knew had played the track. Hmm. I realized this was one of the first movies I had retold just after seeing it. I specifically remember recounting the beginning theme song as I started the retelling and reiterating the lullaby on the retelling's ending. Upon finishing the film, I had to replay the ending to confirm the period of the recollection. Pulling from the building and bridged with the lullaby, my recollection was confirmed. As I listen to this film while the visuals are hidden under these text, Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet sounds like a low key Thurston Howell. The lullaby track was haunting, yet fascinating as it was used throughout the piece. I must say, I love Roman Polanski's soundtrack choices. Call me an old fart for liking the Ninth Gate soundtrack but there's something awesome about the orchestra in that one. At any rate, if you pop in the Konigzucker album from Stein, track two ""Camilla"" sounds so very close to the same lullaby. Compare them, it's fun. And if your lucky enough to have a copy with the featurette of the film you may love Mia's chart and Polanski's chart called ""Mia's chart"". She keeps track of who has been nice or mean to her while Polanski keeps track of her acting behaviorism. And one final bit of excellence about this poetically narrated featurette is Polanski's commentary on Concentration & Relaxation and M.O. to allow the actors to go. Ending this for now.

It should be because her neighbours worship the devil and recruit her husband. Not only that but you are raped by the devil and forced to gestate its only child. There are secret doors and crazy drugs and sects but it is all underplayed so that it is not scary, creepy or has suspense. For shame! Even The Omen (1976) executes the idea better.

It was probably scarier in the seventies, but my generation, having been desensitized by violence and gratuitous special effects, doesn't all in all seem to like films like this. It wasn't terrible.

","I obviously didn't pay full attention to this film when it was on, somehow I found most of it boring, now I can appreciate it as a classic, from writer/director Roman Polanski (Repulsion, Chinatown, The Pianist, Carnage). Basically, in New York City, Rosemary Woodhouse (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Mia Farrow) and actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move into the Bramford apartment building. They were warned against it by their friend Edward 'Hutch' Hutchins (Planet of the Apes' Maurice Evans), due to its association with murder and cannibalism. They soon meet friendly but nosey neighbours Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon), who Rosemary isn't keen to see too often. Strange things start happening, starting with the sudden supposed suicidal death of Terry Gionoffrio (Victoria Vetri, aka Angela Dorian) who Rosemary briefly met in the washroom. Not long after Guy suggests they have a baby together, Rosemary eats some chocolate mousse given by Minnie. She passes out and has a realistic nightmare where she is raped by a demonic creature, in front of Guy, with worshippers around them. Rosemary wakes up with scratches on her body, and Guy says he took advantage while she was unconscious. Dr. C.C. Hill (Charles Grodin), recommended by her friend Elise Dunstan (Emmaline Henr),y confirms Rosemary is pregnant, and she plans to receive further obstetric care from him. However, the Castevets recommend, to save money and for the best care, she go to Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (Ralph Bellamy). He gives her odd advice and the Casavets give her ""vitamin drinks"". Rosemary develops a strange pain in her stomach that doesn't go away for a long while. Hutch becomes disturbed by Rosemary's appearance and hears that she is being fed tannis root, so he does some research. Before he can show his findings, he falls into a coma. Rosemary tells Guy she plans to go back to Dr. Hill, which angers him. But then suddenly, the abdominal pain stops and she feels the baby move for the first time. Three months later, Hutch dies, but before dying was able to send Rosemary a book about witchcraft. Rosemary deduces that Roman Castevet is really an anagram for Steven Marcato, the son of a former Bramford resident who was accused of being a Satanist. She suspects her elderly neighbors and Dr. Sapirstein are part of a Satanic coven with evil plans for her baby, and that Guy is helping them in exchange for his acting career becoming more successful. Rosemary returns to Dr. Hill and shares her concerns, but he assumes she is delusional, and calls Dr. Sapirstein and Guy. Rosemary tries to get away, but is restrained by the other apartment residents. Rosemary goes into labour and is sedated by Dr. Sapirstein. When she wakes, she is told the baby has died, which she refuses to believe, as she hears crying. In the hall closet (blocked by a cabinet earlier), she finds a secret door leadinginto the Castevets' apartment and hears the baby's cries again. Entering with a knife, she finds a congregation made up of the building's tenants, and Dr. Sapirstein, gathered around her newborn son. Rosemary is terrified by the appearance of the child, it is remarked upon that the baby has ""his father's eyes"". Roman explains to Rosemary that Guy is not the child's true father. Her newborn child, named Adrian by the coven, is actually the son of the Devil. Roman urges her to become a mother to her son. Guy tries to calm a horrified Rosemary by explaining to her that they will be generously rewarded, and that they can conceive a second child that will truly be theirs, but Rosemary spits in his face. Minnie tells Rosemary that she should be honored to be the woman chosen to bear a child for Satan. Rosemary tells one of the coven members she is rocking the crib too fast, which is why the child is crying. Rosemary, initially relucantant, goes to the cradle and gently rocks him, with a small smile on her face. Also starring Patsy Kelly as Laura-Louise McBirney, Elisha Cook Jr. as Mr. Nicklas and the voice of Tony Curtis (uncredited) as Donald Baumgart. Farrow is perfect as the victim to this devilish conspiracy, and Gordon is a worthy Oscar winner for her gossipy eccentrically menacing character. It has impeccable music by Krzysztof Komeda, especially the creepy ""lullaby"" (with vocals by Farrow), this is a masterpiece paranoia (with a little dark humour) horror. It won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castevet (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score for Krzysztof Komeda and Best Screenplay. It was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and it was number 9 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!"

","It was hoped that the passage of time would have improved my opinion of this movie. However - it made it worse. Because - Mia Farrow did a lot of acting like a dazed space cadet. Now - it's appropriate for this movie - however - It also gets on my nerves too much. Perhaps - a few short scenes of spaciness would do - then - snap out of hit and hit back! The movie ""Exorcist"" does this nicely - making it more of a chess game between good & evil. At the time I first saw ""Rosemary's Baby"" - it aggravated me that all the electricity & Union wages were spent to show a spaced out girl. I could run down to work - see all the spacey people I want & get paid for it !! That could have been kept to a minimum. At least ""The Exorcist"" people snapped out of it.<br/><br/>Also - it was VERY bothersome at the time that lies & deception seem to be useful to get things done. Regardless how true this is - just for once - I'd love to see truth & honesty gets things done. Tons of movies are made with the use of lies, dishonesty, deception, disloyalty & etc - even when I was little - it was aggravating to watch bullies & liars get their way on screen. Even with a ""Hollywood Ending"" - it would be nice to view movies with the best forces being honesty & truthful dealings. (perhaps - I'll never become a lawyer). <br/><br/>But - with the passage of time - my view of this movie deteriorated badly - never want to see it again.

","It's a watchable but stupid classic movie. The acting and expressions of Rosemary is excellent and the atmosphere gives you chills and suspense but her stupidity disappoints us. It's the first Roman Polanski's movie i've watched and it's really great in technical departments such as cinematography, camera angles, music and directon. But when it comes to screenplay, it's really stupid and idiotic. First of all, where tf are the police and why Rosemary isn't calling them, when they find something suspicious. Also, in the ending when she finds out that the real father of his son was satan, then her reaction is laughable. It's like nothing happened and she blindly accepts the baby. Idk why some people find it acceptable. These are some stupid stuff bout the movie."

","This movie is so good, so believable, and so natural that Polanski was actually BLAMED for by the tabloids my mother read religiously (sorry) for the Manson murders!! ""Well, what can you expect after making that movie? He glorified Satan and said God was dead."". This ignores the fact that he - Polanski - merely made use of an early 60s TIME magazine cover article that in fact read ""IS GOD DEAD"" about declining American church attendance. And before Manson, America blamed Polanski for Mia Darrow's new Auschwitz hairdo, which was really just a hip European female cut. So Rosemary's Baby couldn't buy an impartial review except in that too-brief span anchored between THE HAIRCUT and THE MURDERS. And this doesn't even mention Polanski and the Holocaust and the fact that he really wanted Tuesday Weld in the lead because Rosemary-in-the-novel was described as a healthy milk-fed all-American blonde beauty.
Well, now let's hope the dust has settled enough to call this movie what it is: one of the best horror movies of the 20th century, a regular Val Lewton
A-list big budget movie, if Lewton had ever been given A-list actors and writers and time AND an A-list budget. Of course, A-list money, talent, and time wouldn't have meant squat without Roman Polanski at the helm. Private life aside,he will always be one of the top-five directors in history. After all, he re-invented and improved film noir. Who among us can claim the reclamation of TWO genres, much less

","""Rosemary's Baby"" is an American movie from 1968 written and directed by Roman Polanski, who was in his 30s at that point, but already a prolific and successful filmmaker. I have not read the novel this film is based on, so I cannot say a whole lot about similarities and differences. However, this one is a really long movie at slightly over 2 hours and 15 minutes. It is the story of a young couple who move into a new apartment and what happens when they get in contact and touch with the new neighborhood Eventually, the woman turns pregnant (she planned to) and what sounds like the perfect every day life fairytale turns out the exact opposite though as a secret satanic cult plans to take care of the baby since minute 1 and yes that includes contraception. One of the members is played by Ruth Gordon and she won an Oscar for her portrayal here. Well I like her and I am glad she got the recognition because she was a really talented actress who usually went for likable old ladies (well, that's also what she pretends to be on here). However, I don't think her turn here was really this outstanding honestly, even if she did all she could with the character and there are some good moments and she is a bit of a scene stealer in a pretty grateful role. The other Oscar nomination went to Polanski for his script and I think it is not undeserving by any means. He also would have deserved one for his direction as there were many really awesome camera angles that definitely added nicely to the film's atmosphere and overall outcome. It was a really gritty film that had me on the edge of my seat on several occasions. This was the second time I watched the movie, this time with subtitles. I think the surprise element was obviously even bigger for the first time back then and I still kept thinking maybe it is not the way she says it is. Maybe she is really sick in her head and making it all up. But this time now, it really could not have been any more obvious that she is not crazy, but fell victim to a very sinister gang of people in a situation in which she could not even rely on the one she loves the most let alone the doctor she trusts. Anyway, rewatching this is also rewarding. You do know how it turns out eventually, but still you will find something new all the time. Not always though, sometimes the hints are very subtle. The film has no intention to shove them into your face constantly. There are lengthy sequences with no indicators at all. The best recurring example is how all characters, especially the husband, always stay calm and gentle and tell her if she does not want to, she does not have to, although they clearly would be innerly frustrated if she doesn't, whatever this is referring to, most of all probably eating and drinking all kinds of poisoned stuff.<br/><br/>The lead actress here is Mia Farrow and while I think Gordon is not Oscar-worthy, Farrow (who was at that point still married to Frank Sinatra) most likely is. It is disappointing she did not get the nomination, especially after her Golden Globe nomination, and also given the fact that she was never nominated for an Oscar afterwards. This still in her early 20s is perhaps her career-defining role from a movie that, if you take a look at the quantity of votes, can easily be called one of the most famous 60s movies. As for Farrow, she starts like a fearless hopeful young woman resembling an angel almost with her long blonde hair. But the longer the film goes, the more she moves away from that, her pale face, her constant suffering and of course halfway into the film her lost hair. Wait, that approach won Hathaway at least partially an Oscar, guess it wasn't too big of a thing back then yet. Or was she wearing a wig early on? I don't know. But it's not too important either. Fact is, she gives an outstanding performance with a really really challenging role and would have deserved better awards-wise and proves she is not less talented than her prolific parents, probably even more and she got the best from both of them in her genes, in terms of talent and looks (and I am saying this as somebody who generally does not like blondes thaaaat much, so it means something). Her husband is played by John Cassavetes and I quite like him, so he was a nice distraction too. Also physically as female straight audiences will agree. He plays basically the in-between between Farrow's character and the cult. He is not a satanist or at least not right away and not as dedicated when it comes to the subject, but he (initially) mostly thinks about his career and that he no longer wants to be an unsuccessful actor and these people can make it happen if he helps them with their plans. He also had great chemistry with Farrow I thought, so nice inclusion and casting decision. May he rest in peace, also a pretty underrated actor who is sadly not known by too many (non-film buffs) anymore. Now as for Polanski, there is lots of darkness to his life and you will always find a dark side to his films as well. This one here sure is not an exception. Even the seemingly innocent nudity feels heavy in a way that there is something going on beyond love and Polanski really got that nicely on the screen. And then obviously the impregnation dream sequence scene that was oh so real (because she did not eat the entire mousse). He elaborated nicely there that sometimes you don't really know what is dream and what is reality, in the most polluted way in fact. Then the main character's decreasing health, the scene when she seeks hope with the few people she trusts like the other doctor and obviously her husband, who betrays her. Her elderly friend who gets killed by the cult when he takes stance somewhat against them, but still manages to give her an important message on the way or the young woman she befriends early on whose fate stayed rather mysterious. But she sure was not missed by the old couple. It should also be said that Sidney Blackmer plays his part well, nothing to hide next to Gordon and the scenes when we see him without her, he is just as good.<br/><br/>Finally I also want to say that I really liked the music here. The soundtrack is top-notch, shame Polanski's collaborator in that field died so early, very deserving Golden Globe nod that once again did not transition into an Oscar nomination unfortunately. But music-wise the highlight is probably the lullaby we hear at the very beginning and end and at the end we can also understand why it was included there. It is of course a reference to the deformed devil-like creature that Rosemary calls her son now. Also despite who he is and what happened, she somewhat accepts him and has maternal feelings. There with the other lady pulling out her tongue at Rosemary, Polanski also could not resist getting in a wheeze of humor (maybe directly from the book I don't know), but other than this is typical acomedic Polanski stuff. This is just not his genre. Or at least at best his third or 4th genre choice in a movie and here comedy is entirely non-existent unless you smile perhaps at some of the moments that are pretty telling in what direction this film is heading, but you wouldn't during first watch, so it just has nothing to do with comedy. Okay what else can be added? Don't expect to see any really famous faces here especially in the supporting cast. But don't worry, all the actors are pretty experienced and doing a really fine job, which comes with the experience they got of course as many cast members here are pretty old already. Overall, this was a pretty good watch and I am happy I got to see this on the big screen again for a second time. It was still slightly better when I saw it first I think and considered giving it 4 stars out of 5 really, but it does not turn into a film by any means that should not be seen more than once. On the contrary, I think even for the 5th watch, you will still discover many new things in this film. So I absolutely think you should watch it. I am not always too great on horror, but the way it is executed here, it was a nice experience. No cheap scare thrills needed, it is all hidden beneath and that's what makes it so good, even if admittedly here and there I felt there was a moment when the film just tried to be way too special like perhaps with the book and play on words involving one character's name. If I remember correctly, then this also bothered me a bit when I saw it first. Still kinda funny though how they have an explanation for everything. But why oh why would the old guy not just give himself a completely different name. Oh well, I guess he was sure his true identity would never be discovered. So finally, people who say blah blah the film based on a good book always sucks anyway, should watch these over 2 hours and they may hopefully change their opinion if they are just a bit open-minded. Thumbs up from me. No doubt about it."

","While this horror film isn't one that I think modern audiences would find particularly terrifying, as psychological horror piece, it still works wonders. This is the kind of film that might not scare you as much as films like ""Hereditary"", but its one that you'll have a hard time forgetting. Even as I lay down to sleep last night, my mind still running over the horrors I'd just revisited... What did Roman say to Guy to convince him to join in the ceremony? How could Guy participate in such a thing? And most importantly, after Roman revealed that Rosemary's baby was the antichrist, did Rosemary stay and raise the baby, that is to say, does she raise the antichrist? After all, she his mother... Those lingering questions stay with me longer than a modern splatter film ever will.

","Rosemary's Baby is a film that is not meant to be a terrifying movie per se, but when it comes to a film that puts you on edge, kills you with tension, and simply steals your human attention to the point where suspense is at an all time high, there are few movies that compare.<br/><br/>When watching this movie I was already put off during the opening credits. It lures you in with potential happiness and joy between our two leads but that is harshly and violently reversed with a simple yet effective tone shift. This movie doesn't screw around, when it decides to get dark, it embraces that darkness with absolute conviction.<br/><br/>Is Rosemary's Baby as horrific as people say? No, it's actually more.<br/><br/>Normally when a movie is created with so many spiritual themes and concepts being introduced it often fails to deliver with a creative and frightening end game. But when you see the ending of this movie you will suddenly be filled with a sense of dread that cannot be put into words. There are scenes that literally shock me into silence so that I can't find humor or any sign of light whatsoever. It's as if there is only evil within this movie which makes our connection to Rosemary that much more powerful. Throughout this entire movie I feel a sense of dread with the exception of maybe a few scenes in the beginning and that party scene, but even then I couldn't find myself happy, just holding in nervous laughter. With this movie, you're mood is just killed and you are punished for having any sort of hope. This makes the climax all the more effective: I thought I was prepared, but I wasn't.<br/><br/>My only nitpicks might be that some of the scenes are kinda dated with the movie makers not having complete knowledge of cigarettes and alcohol and how these just don't appear during pregnancies, ideally, but now that I think about it this might have been intentional as another way to show how something is wrong.<br/><br/>This is one of the most terrifying movies I have seen and an absolute must for he/she who wants to venture into the horror that is Rosemary's Baby. 9/10."

"jrdnlwn","10","0","1","16 August 2016"," One of the best horror films I have seen!
","Although Rosemary's Baby is not among my favorite films of all time, it is still a masterpiece, and I would even say that it's better than the Exorcist in some ways. Rosemary's Baby proves that a film doesn't need special effects (blood, gore, zombies, etc.) in order to be a scary film. Mystery and the sense of the unknown drives this film and makes it truly chilling. <br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie, although very unpleasant, is the scene where Rosemary dreams of getting raped by Satan. The way the scene is executed is extremely well done and it successfully brings terror to the screen. The audience realizes that Satan is raping her without it telling the audience directly. There are a lot of things to figure out that add on to the dread in this film. I also loved that Rosemary was forced to see more than one doctor because it made me question if there was any way that Rosemary could cure her ""illness.""<br/><br/>To be quite honest, I didn't really understand the movie when I first watched it, especially the ending, so I didn't love it the first time I saw it. However, after watching it again, I picked up some of the parts that I missed and it all made sense to me, leaving me disturbed, yet amazed.<br/><br/>Although Rosemary's Baby is an older film, it still remains a classic today. The pacing of the movie is more on the slower side, but without the slow pacing, the suspense would not be as strong. I am a filmmaker and this is the reason why I choose to make my films slower-paced. I find pacing to be an important factor in films because it can completely change the mood of any film. <br/><br/>The acting was great! Mia's performance was incredible, from scenes where she had severe pain inside of her...to her reactions of the tragic events that affected several people that she knew...to her frustration with the doctors and the treatments she was receiving...to her final reaction of her baby's eyes at the end! <br/><br/>Another thing to be discussed in this film is the apparently frequent use of symbolism, ideas, and themes. Satan seems to be the most common symbol. Pretty much everything that happens in this film is centered around the concept of Satan. I think reality is an important theme in this film also. The entire film is somewhat surreal in a way I cannot explain. Eraserhead and this film both seem to share the idea of a deformed or, in this case, damned child. I could keep going on about themes, symbols, and ideas, but I will end this review with a conclusion.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror film. I do not believe in special effects, when it comes to horror films; I believe in the audience sensing the unknown, whatever or whomever it shall be. This is indeed a MASTERPIECE and I absolutely respect every bit of it! CHILLING, MYSTERIOUS, CREEPY, DISTURBING, DARK...these words all apply. <br/><br/>I will be back to revise this review."
"the_bluesman","10","0","1","8 August 2016"," Psychological horror at its best!
","I haven't seen 'Rosemary's Baby' in well over a decade and have just finished watching it again. I had forgotten what an awesome horror thriller Roman Polanski has created here. It definitely is one of the prime examples of its genre. Sure, its buildup is rather slow by today's standards but that's just what I like to see in a good psychological horror movie. It's by no means a blood and gore movie, which many people identify with the horror genre, but rather a movie that creates the thrill and horror in your head, much like Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' (1980) does.<br/><br/>On the outside, 'Rosemary's Baby' comes in the disguise of a drama and there is very little graphic horror to be found in it, except for one scene in which you get a glimpse of Satan himself, but that's pretty much it. The movie rather relies on good character development and captivating lines of well-written dialogue delivered by a cast of actors who really know how to occupy the screen. Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are perfectly cast as Rosemary's odd next-door neighbors, as is Mia Farrow in the role of the seemingly fragile Rosemary, who she plays marvelously and with great depth.<br/><br/>The movie sticks very closely to Rosemary and we as the audience experience the unfolding of the story from her perspective. That is one of the reasons why this movie is very relatable. Gradually, Rosemary finds more clues which indicate that some kind of witchery must be going on around her. Or is it just her mind playing tricks on her? Up until the fantastic finale, in which Sidney Blackmer really shines as the leader of the coven, vigorously screaming ""Hail Satan!"" from the top of his lungs, she is never quite sure, and we aren't either. That's what creates a very ominous atmosphere and makes this movie so captivating. 'Rosemary's Baby' has no need to show much to be frightening. In fact, we never even get to see the titular baby. It's all just in your head."

","Rosemary's Baby is a fantastic horror movie. Mia Farrow is flawless in this film playing the victim. Rosemary is one of Mia's best roles and I thought she looked beautiful in it. The direction and the cinematography is spot on and few directors can make films as intriguing as this. The plot is about a woman with a greedy (creepy) husband who sells his wife's body out so she becomes impregnated with a ""demonic/ supernatural child."" The husband is a real creep because he is willing to do whatever it takes to gain wealth even if it means shattering his wife's mind. Warning, this movie contains disturbing material. The chanting is scary, so you might not like this movie if you think Poltergeist is scary. For me Rosemary's Baby is a far better film than The Exorcist. There is profanity (I think there may be religious profanity) so if you want to watch this movie and do not like profanity, watch it using a profanity filter on your TV, etc. Overall, this movie is very interesting."
"bowmanblue","10","0","1","12 July 2016"," Timeless horror on so many levels
","If you have only really heard of 'Rosemary's Baby,' by its considerable reputation then you may be inclined to believe that it simply finds its horror through a tale of demonic possession. After all, its central premise is that a young couple move into an upmarket apartment block in New York, only to find that their new neighbours are more than a little bit satanic. Maybe it was just a film about devil worshipers when it was released back in the sixties. However, watching it now, there's a secondary level of 'horror' written into it – namely how women are both portrayed and treated.<br/><br/>Mia Farrow plays the titular 'Rosemary' as she's basically pushed, pulled, ordered and generally manhandled through both her attempts to get pregnant and the subsequent pregnancy itself. If this film doesn't bring a shudder down most women's spines at how little control the central protagonist gets in her life and body then nothing the devil himself will.<br/><br/>But, of course, speaking of Beelzebub, he does do his best to make an appearance and generally make things even worse for our helpless heroine. The devil-worshipping scenes are pretty dark and Roman Polanski's chilling direction gives the whole film a clinical and bleak feel to it.<br/><br/>'Rosemary's Baby' is still as watchable today (and, of course, deeply horrific and disturbing) as it was all those years ago. It doesn't need gallons of fake blood or computer-generated effects to be scary. Everything here feels a little too real and is a credit to how films can be made. Don't expect a roller-coaster ride of scares and guts – it's much too 'foreboding' to succumb to anything so cheap and easy. If you're in the mood for something horrible, dark with an every-increasing sense of dread then give this one a watch before it gets remade with too many special effects and no soul (and I'm not counting the 'Astronaut's Wife' in that!)."

","Is it too soon to sing Roman Polanski's praises as a director? His 1968 feature, his first American production, Rosemary's Baby cements him at the forefront of true auteurs. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes join with their odd chemistry to expose the deterioration of a couple who moves into a Gothic style apartment in New York City with an unsavory history. Utilizing exceptional spatial relationships, Polanski weaves a near-perfect psychological horror movie for the ages.<br/><br/>Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) are a young couple ready to make a home and start a family. Once they view a Gothic style apartment in Manhatten, they fall in love with the property and move in, in spite of the warnings against moving in from their current landlord who warns them of the scary history of the building's past. Immediately after moving in, an older nosy couple that lives in the building, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer) and (Ruth Gordon) befriend the young couple. At first, the couple laughs off their quirky behavior until Guy becomes fascinated by Roman's stories and begins spending a great deal of time at their apartment. Rosemary remains skeptical about their idiosyncrasies but becomes distracted when she finally becomes pregnant after a strange dream she has. The further along in her pregnancy Rosemary gets, the more strained and distant her relationship with her husband becomes. When Roman and Minnie take an obsessive interest in her pregnancy and child, Rosemary becomes convinced that the couple and their friends have demonic interests in her baby.<br/><br/>The directing prowess of Roman Polanski in this faithful adaptation of the book by Ira Levin of the same name is one that will impact the audience and stay with you long after the film concludes. He absolutely nails the overwhelmingly claustrophobic mood of the film by confining most of the film to being shot in the young couple's apartment. Confining the shots to just the couple's apartment was even more pronounced as Polanski placed the actors in such close proximity to each other that they bumped into each other as they were roaming around the new home. He also compiled among the film several well-executed long shots further exposing the deliberate movements and the close proximity of the actors. I just can't get over how well Polanski filmed Rosemary's Baby, I thought I had seen it all when I saw his Chinatown, but Rosemary's Baby was far superior, and to think it was his first American film. Some directors just have ""it"".<br/><br/>The whole time Rosemary was preparing to be a mother, she was being manipulated by other people. She was doing her absolute best to protect her child, even though it meant putting herself at risk. Rosemary had wanted to become a mother since she and Guy's marriage and was overwhelmed with happiness to finally get the chance. As her pregnancy progressed, Rosemary realized something was vastly different with her Dr., recommended to her by the Castevets. She was gravely ill throughout most of her pregnancy even though she was taking the special drink prepared daily by Minnie. Once she was finally convinced that a demonic episode was taking place with her baby as the pawn, Rosemary did her best to escape, but all her efforts were thwarted by her husband and the Castevets. At the film's conclusion, Rosemary knows what has happened to her child and must make the ultimate decision on whether to parent the child she always wanted or abandon what had become of him."

I am used to the horror movies that are made nowadays which hold a maximum rating of 6.5 and not more than that. I was also afraid that I will not like the movie and considering the fact that I am a movie lover, it would be really sad to not like it because it is a classic. The meaning of classic is that it is not tainted by time. It just becomes better.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the actors so I know little of them. They were fantastic. The movie was centered on Rosemary, so it was important that the audience feels sad for the condition of Rosemary and the actress makes us feel for her. Guy is conflicted about what he is doing and he shows it in every decision he takes. He is just one bad moment from bursting out. Other side-roles are average, a bit stereo-typed, especially the neighbors.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward and the best thing is that the reveal is slow. We are confused that what is real and what is not. The dream-sequences really make you go dizzy. It is a slow burner but the pace is worth it. You are almost forced to rush to the end but then something pulls you back to stay alongside Rosemary till the end. I enjoyed it immensely. I think horror movies should be made like this instead of investing in jump scares and gore. The only movie that comes even remotely close is ""The Conjuring"", but considering the amount of jump scares and CGI moments it has, I'll say there are not many true horror movies that come close to ""Rosemary's Baby"""
"villani","Null","0","1","10 January 2016"," Motherhood and the Devil's Pact
","Motherhood plays a crucial role in the emergence of the Devil, and the Devil's Pact. Eve is the first ambitious human to be discontent with her station and strive for more knowledge. She is the prototype of the Faustian legends. She wanted to be like God, having the same knowledge as Him. In biblical terms, the Fall represents the introduction of evil and the beginning of history or temporality. This temporality introduces a line of ancestry, and the creation of humankind, who will intrinsically strive as their mother had. Maternity should play an important role in any story involving the Devil because of the concurrence of motherhood in the creation of history and the introduction of evil. Although Devil's Pact stories have typically only dealt with male striving, Rosemary's Baby highlights the importance of motherhood in the Devils' mythology.<br/><br/>Rosemary is depicted as a figure similar to Mary, mother of Jesus. They both mother a savior who has come to redeem the world. Mary births the son of God, and Rosemary births one of Satan. While Rosemary is juxtaposed in name and motherhood to Mary, whose son would reverse the effects of the Fall, it is evident that the son of the Devil would continue the effects. This film replicates the occurrence of the Fall. Eve eats of the apple and leads Adam to eat also. Here Rosemary leads her husband to eat with the Castevets, serving as the serpent's temptation of which he bites.<br/><br/>The presence of the Devil and evil are as plain upon her as a piece of jewelry. The necklace that Rosemary receives indirectly through Satan contains Tannis root, later referred to as Devil's pepper. This has a bad odor that Rosemary, Hutch, Sapirstein's nurse, and Guy notice and comment on. As Mephistopheles says, ""a whiff of anything makes plain whether it's holy or profane."" Motherhood is clearly linked to the jewelry since Rosemary puts the necklace on the first night she finds out she is pregnant.<br/><br/>The nativity scene of Mary alone in the stable becomes important in viewing motherhood in this work of art. Motherhood as it relates to the Devil is very much an individual endeavor. Minnie tells her to go home when she spies her waiting for Hutch. Dr. Sapirstein advises her not to speak to any friends, or her Aunt ""Fanny"". Satan only rapes her once her wedding ring is taken off, and from the first day she knows she is pregnant, her body language in the bed makes her an isolated mother figure talking to her unborn baby, while the unresponsive Guy sleeps. The mother is always a solitary figure.<br/><br/>And she is an ugly, insane solitary figure. None of the typically beautiful descriptions of motherhood apply when related to the Devil. After Rosemary becomes pregnant, everyone she meets tells her how awful she looks. Guy thinks it is her haircut, which was the ""worst mistake (she) ever made."" Hutch asks in shock, ""My God what's wrong with you?"" and tells her she looks terrible. Her friends at the party tell her that she looks like chalk and that she looks tired. The party takes place at the time of her greatest pain, and the uglier she gets the more she desires the ""day's brilliant light."" She is also depicted in a negative light when seen as insane. According to Guy, she has the ""prepartum crazies."" <br/><br/>The Pact is strongly linked to motherhood because the striving male sacrifices the woman he loves to attain his goals. Guy is not satisfied, and in order to attain his dream of acting fame and fortune, he sacrifices his wife to the Devil. Literally having life's blood painted on her for the rape ceremony very clearly depicts the connection between the role of motherhood, the striving male and the Devil's Pact. It is the ambitious male who sacrifices the woman, thereby aligning himself with the Devil. Woman is left to breed more males to continue the process.<br/><br/>In relation to the Devil, the mother's only role becomes that of breeder of evil. She initially begins the Fall, and she continues the evil through her offspring. A drinking metaphor is one that emerges with the mother and Devil theme, played out with all of Rosemary's drinks, morning pills, and Adrian's drinking her milk. Instead of the nurturing role motherhood has typically embodied, here the mother is reduced to a very physical base level of need. The Tannis root drinks keep Rosemary unconscious so Satan can rape her, and the morning pills keep her unconscious so the coven can raise Adrian without her interference. All that remains for her is to give birth to him, and provide his milk. The Devil's work is to swell the ranks, and motherhood fits in by breeding the evil through each generation.<br/><br/>A sense of impending doom arises with the arrival of each progressive generation being born. Adrian Marcado conjures up the Devil, bears a son Roman, and he lives on to consort with the Devil just like his father. Roman Castavet aids the begetting of a mortal son of Satan to reap vengeance on the world. The inevitability of creating the Devil again is central in the maternal theme. Woman is inextricably linked to the Devil and the Devil's Pact. She created it and she will continue it."
"jmagil-479-168545","10","0","1","9 November 2015"," A Political Allegory
","""Rosemary's Baby"" is a political allegory. A young woman (Rosemary Woodhouse), symbolizing the youth of America, struggles with a powerful, charismatic older man (Roman Castevet), symbolizing America's Establishment (what the power elite were called at the time), for control over a child (whose identity remains a mystery until the end of the film), who symbolizes the future. The older man wins the struggle. The timing of the film was remarkably fortuitous as 1968, the year of its release, was the turning point of the 1960s, the year that power was wrested from the largely youthful, political left of the country and, with the election of Richard Nixon as President, returned to the power elite, who have been moving this country further and further to the political right ever since. Seen in this light, Polanski's 1974 film ""Chinatown"" is essentially a remake of ""Rosemary's Baby."" A young woman (Evelyn Mulwray) struggles with a powerful, charismatic, and in this instance very rich older man (Noah Cross) for control over their child (Katherine). Again, the older man wins. This ending was Polanski's idea, which suggests that he was aware of the political significance of his earlier film. Here, it suggests that the New Deal would only be allowed to go so far before the power elite seized control again. In this film, the seizure of power is more literal, as the Los Angeles water supply that Noah Cross finally controls is the actual source of life."

","Roman Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" is an early great horror film that I particularly enjoyed. I think the difference between horror films now and in the past is that the plot of older films are generally more scary than the plot of horror films today. I think in many horror films today, the loudness and ""pop ups"" scare you more than the actual story itself. This is not the case in Rosemary's Baby. The story follows the ancient tales of sacrificing young children in return of certain promises with evil and good characters. The constant reference to Satan worshipers and the overall feel of evil give this film its greatness. A part I thought that was interesting was the lack of settings in a way. It seemed as though Rosemary never travelled far and was always in reach of her apartment. Many movies I enjoy have a variety of settings but this was different and I enjoyed it. Overall, this movie is significant to the truly horrifying plot and the way the story is told."

It could be the time period, but I found the portrayal of these topics a little judgmental. I know people who are genuinely fascinated by topics like these and they do not get involved in something like this. For the circumstance, I understood why they went down this route, but knowing people who have a particular fondness for these topics makes it hard for me to see them as evil characters.<br/><br/>Overall, a surprisingly well-done film.

","I thought Rosemary's baby was a very interesting and spooky movie. I love scary movies because they are so unpredictable. The movie consisted of lots of dark lighting and pretty average camera work and a variety of short takes. It is about a couple, Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse, who move in to a kind of creepy apartment in Manhattan. They become friends with the old couple next door but weird things began happening to Rosemary that started to freak her out and Guy starts to spend a lot of time with the older couple especially after their ward committed suicide. A woman Rosemary met while doing laundry one day suddenly died a very mysterious death then Rosemary began to hear strange noises and even had a scary dream where a weird scary monster type thing makes love to her. Guy became very distant after Rosemary told him all the weird things she was going through. After she delivered the baby, she found out that her neighbors had other plans for her son. When she awoke after the birth, they told her that her son was dead but then she heard him crying in the next room over and went to see what was going on. After she walked up to her son, who was surrounded by the neighbors, she saw a devilish look in his eye and that's when they told her that her baby was the spawn of Satan. The movie ends with the people trying to convince Rosemary to raise the baby and how she didn't have to join the cult if she didn't want to. The movie ends with Rosemary holding her son and kind of smiling so you don't know what she plans on doing in the future with him which just adds to the overall spooky vibe of the movie."

","Rosemary's Baby is an ingeniously deliberated dramatic thriller that delivers the slow-burn, taut story of a young couple that has just moved into the upper class sector of New York. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes) land a spacious apartment in a building with an extensive history of ghoulish occurrences. No sooner have they been acquainted with their eccentric neighbors Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) than Rosemary gets pregnant and the couple sees an up-tick in their fortunes, both professionally and personally. Very soon, every old crone in the building starts intruding Rosemary's life, from steering her toward their chosen obstetrician to forcing down her throat a vitamin drink of their own concoction. Just a few bites of their chocolate mousse give her woozy nightmares and start a hellish tempest in her womb. She has strange dreams of participating in arcane rituals. Soon a horrifying sexual fever dream renders her incapacitated by fear and paranoia. She begins to suspect that her neighbors have nefarious goals and are planning to harm her baby and gets curious why her husband is allowing them to do so.<br/><br/>The apartment takes on an entire life of its own that hides its own pulse and underbelly but is completely free of exposure from the outside world. All the while once Rosemary catches on to her neighbors' ploy and decides to flee for her life, there's the sense of claustrophobia as she discovers everything she assumed she knew in her life has been a facade right from the word go. Rosemary's Baby is inundated with Polanski's trademark style and preoccupations. It draws viewers gradually into considering the possibility that the movie's series of strange coincidences and accumulating sense of dread are only subjective representations of Rosemary's unraveling mental state. And Polanski's ability to prime the audience into questioning Rosemary's suspicions gives it an unnerving quality. Polanski (who also wrote the screenplay) is more interested in creating a crawling sense of discomfort by making everything seem plausible. He expertly winds up the paranoia with spooky atmospherics and morbid humor.<br/><br/>Cassavetes is deliciously smarmy as struggling actor Guy who will do whatever it takes to become a famous. Gordon plays the garrulous, nosy menace Minnie in her inimitable style. But the real star here is 23-year-old Mia Farrow playing the mousy title character, who uses her timorous space-child vulnerability remarkably to underscore her terror and solitude. <br/><br/>Even after all these years, the movie is still a terrifying thriller that is held up by its incredible ensemble cast, and clever premise. In this era of go-boo and CGI suffused horror movies, Rosemary's Baby continues to be celebrated as a cautionary tale."
"luis_neiva","7","0","1","17 January 2015"," As frightening as a movie can be!
","Rosemary's Baby is a gruesome and intense story adapted for the big screen by the Polish director Roman Polanski, from the novel with the same name by Ira Levin. Although it does not contain the elements that traditionally compose a horror movie (blood, sudden shock-moments, etc.) this film is a masterpiece of its genre because it does not depend on these same elements to create a truly frightening and unsettling atmosphere.<br/><br/>Guy (John Cassavetes) and Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) are a young couple facing a promising life together. Guy is an actor looking for his big break and Rosemary longs to be a mother. The two just moved into an apartment in the heart of Manhattan where they have as neighbors Roman (Sydney Blackmer) and Minnie Castavet (Ruth Gordon), a caring but nosy elderly couple. Guy develops a close relationship to his neighbors while his wife does not feel very comfortable around them. Finally, Rosemary's much desired pregnancy happens but brings unexpected complications: the young woman begins to lose weight and to feel excruciating pains in her stomach. A series of unusual events, strange noises coming from the apartment next door and a strange obsession revealed by Minnie for her pregnancy, lead Rosemary to a state of complete distrust on those around her and fear for the baby that she's carrying.<br/><br/>This whole storyline is framed perfectly by Polanski. The unsettling and gloomy atmosphere present throughout the film is immediately introduced by the strange lullaby sung by Mia Farrow during the opening credits. The architecture, decoration and lightning of the settings create in the viewer a constant sense of claustrophobia and the confusing succession of screenshots in some moments - particularly during the odd nightmare of Rosemary - implement in the public an almost asphyxiating feeling of anxiety that lasts for several hours after the end of the movie. In general, all the actors are very convincing in their roles and contribute a lot in creating a great familiarity between the viewer and the scene. However, there are two representations that stand out: Mia Farrow is brilliant in the role of the innocent young pregnant woman, fragile and submissive, personality to which his avant-garde pixie hair cut offers an interesting counterpoint, and Ruth Gordon offers a sublime interpretation of the comic yet sinister Minnie Castavet. Roman Polanski leads the suspense masterfully, revealing the whole plot progressively, creating a very intimate connection between the viewer and the main character. This turns to be particularly brilliant when, instead of ending the film with some unexpected and shocking happening, he chooses a predictable but inevitable conclusion, as if we all knew bad things were meant to happen and there was no way out. This makes the story even scarier.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't like to feel anxious and scared, so to say that I have suffered every second of this film is the best thing I can say about it. It is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of horror cinema and a must for all lovers of the genre."

","I have a feeling that if the academy had opened the category to six nominees, then my choice would have been nominated. By 1968, Mia Farrow was best known as Mrs. Frank Sinatra and by the time of the academy awards, she was better known as the former Mrs. Frank Sinatra. That wouldn't deter from the fact that she gave her single best performance in Roman Polanski's moody adaptation of Ira Levin's novel Rosemary's Baby.<br/><br/>Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse a semi-newlywed looking for an apartment with her actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) find the perfect place in Manhattan's Bram Building, a large odd, elder-tenement that is strange even before we realize why. There is a closet that seems blocked off for no reason, all of the other tenants seem to be in their 70s and on their first night, there is odd chanting coming from the apartment next door. The oddities are there but they don't seem to shake Rosemary even as she begins having bizarre dreams about ritualistic sex.<br/><br/>Her neighbors are not exactly threatening – they are older grandparent-types who always come by with caring smiles, warm tea and desserts. She and Guy have their closest relationship with Roman and Millie Casavets (Sydney Berman and Ruth Gordon), a childless old couple who treat Rosemary like the daughter they never had. It all seems normal. Rosemary and Guy have the usual husband and wife conflicts, but they remain a loving couple and soon after they settle into the tenement, they decide to have a baby.<br/><br/>This is where things turn bizarre. On the night of the conception Rosemary has a dessert given to her by Mrs. Casavets, becomes dizzy and passes out. She enters into a bizarre dream in which she is raped by a demon while her neighbors stand around nude watching the act (for some reason, one of the onlookers resembles Jackie Kennedy from that day in November). When she awakens, she finds scratches on her body and Guy apologizes that he was such an animal in bed. Things surface that seem to conform to her dream, Mrs. Casavets keeps bringing tea and desserts and new people keep showing up. There is an odd sense that the people around her seem off-kilter, somehow askew; they don't look as we expect from our fellow human beings; there is a look in their eyes that seems strange. She visits an elder doctor who seems to take her; suspicions and turns them on her, he is more interested in prescribing medicine than caring for his patient.<br/><br/>All of this is played, more or less, through Rosemary's eyes. We never leave her side and, for most of the film, we don't understand what goes on when she's not around. The best note that Farrow brings to the performance is a naive sensibility. There's a wide-eyed kid still lurking in her, the sensibilities of her teenage years haven't completely left her, even though she is now in her early twenties. If she had allowed Rosemary to be stronger, more confident, then the performance wouldn't work. We have to believe that she is naive enough to think that she is caught under someone's spell and that she is susceptible to suggestion; if she contained a strong mind that could piece together the puzzle, than we would believe that she could work her way out of this situation.<br/><br/>The final image of the film in one of the most striking as she looks into her baby's bassinet. She realizes that every suspicion was correct, that everyone around her had a hand in the deception and the conception, we realize that Rosemary has now fallen under the spell and as the image quietly fades out and into the Paramount logo, we realize that this story has no happy ending."

","Perhaps I have been around for too many years since Rosemary's Baby was a new hit film and so all of the tropes in it which were perhaps exciting and new for audiences when the film first premiered struck me as cliché and not all that interesting and/or innovative. The film was definitely not a bad one but I was underwhelmed given it's significance as a touchstone in the popular culture. Perhaps the most interesting part of the film for me was the way in which it dealt with the medical and psychiatric coercion of women and how this serves to oppress them and hurt their best interests. I do think that the decision of the director never to show the baby on camera was the correct one.

","Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a masterwork of outstanding direction, polished screenplay & stellar performances that may lean towards the supernatural in small doses but what truly makes it an enduring masterpiece of its genre is the seamless manner in which it employs the psychological elements of horror filmmaking into its premise by creating a chilling sense of dread, paranoia & suspense over the course of its runtime.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Rosemary's Baby takes place in the year of 1966 and concerns a young couple; struggling actor Guy Woodhouse & his lovely wife Rosemary, who move into a notorious apartment building in New York and are gleefully greeted by their elderly but eccentric neighbours. The main plot concerns Rosemary's pregnancy as she becomes more n more paranoid & suspects her neighbours to be a part of an occult society.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Polanski, the film marks his American film debut & he really couldn't have asked for a better start. Rosemary's Baby works as an effective thriller in the first watch but it's the next viewings where one truly discovers just how expertly the director has managed to make the smallest of details play a crucial role in shaping up the whole picture. Deftly scripted by Polanski in his first stint as a writer, the film follows the book very closely and is one of the most faithful adaptations in motion picture history.<br/><br/>Cleverly shot from start to finish and employing excellent use of long takes & camera angles, Cinematography beautifully serves its purpose of encapsulating the entire feature with an eerie, tense & insecure atmosphere which escalates further as the film progresses. Editing is immaculately done as every sequence feels relevant to the plot. And the lullaby that bookends the film is a haunting piece while the other tracks have an unusual presence that ultimately works in favour of the film.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Rosemary's Baby features a very reliable cast & benefits greatly from their committed performances. Mia Farrow is immensely convincing as Rosemary & her gaunt appearance only adds more flesh to her character. John Cassavetes doesn't get enough credit for his role but if one looks closely, his action kind of hints at the sinister ending this film has in store for the viewers. Sidney Blackmer & Ruth Gordon capture the essence of their characters in an authentic manner and the contribution from rest of its cast is no slouch either.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Rosemary's Baby remains one of the most unsettling films of all time that still hasn't lost much of its potency despite being over 45 years old & continues to reveal more of its brilliance on subsequent viewings. Its real strength lies in its ability to keep the viewers immersed into its intriguing story that wonderfully balances its elements without ever relying on any sort of gore or violence. And the final payoff is absolutely worth the wait. A laudable work of precision craftsmanship & a timeless classic in every sense of the word, Rosemary's Baby comes strongly recommended. Multiple viewings advised."

Oh, and she gets knocked up by Satan as well.<br/><br/>Roman Polanski's faithful adaptation of Ira Levin's bestseller Rosemary's Baby is an unmissable treat, a slow-burn classic of the Satanic horror sub-genre that builds inexorably to its chilling climax with class and style, never resorting to cheap scare tactics (which some might find surprising given that producer William Castle is renowned for his schlock horror B-movies).<br/><br/>Polanski's approach is all about the foreboding atmosphere and mounting tension, building slowly on the sense of dread first triggered by a potted history of the infamous Bramford Building (given by Rosemary's friend Hutch) with a series of bizarre incidences that eventually have Rosemary believing that her neighbours are witches aiming to steal her as-yet unborn baby. Of course, Rosemary is not far wrong but Polanski cleverly toys with his audience right to the finish, almost having us doubt her sanity towards the end despite all that we have seen.<br/><br/>Barring a brief glimpse of a bloody corpse—a suicide victim who hits the sidewalk with a splat—the film is totally devoid of gore, but even if you usually prefer your horror drenched in red, this effective chiller still comes highly recommended."

It is a classic and I don't think it needs to be remade. I love how we go through the perspective of Rosemary in her dreams and her wildest, darkest fantasies as she can not tell what's going on or what is happening around her. I also like the sense of dread throughout as that the neighbors become much more evil and more psychotic as we look at them more. Even the husband, Guy who suddenly goes crazy, day after day reminded me of ""The Shining"" when Jack Nicolson's character went ballistic. I also like the unreal aspects like when she got pregnant, witches and demons.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece and possibly up there with some of my other favorite horror films. It's creepy, eerie, dramatic, horrifying and sometimes dark in every way.<br/><br/>I also thought that the actors were excellent in their roles. Each actor was very believable. Mia Farrow as Rosemary is superb in every way possible. She makes us feel sympathy and sorrow for her. It's like we are really with her, trying to fight off all of this nasty evil which is attacking her.<br/><br/>Another thing to give thumbs up to is the amount of violence referenced or shown throughout. There is one death, but it is never shown, nor are there are anymore deaths occurring throughout. No BLOOD or GORE is reveled which is FINALLY good because it leaves us to the mystery of how and why these strange things are happening.<br/><br/>Even my friend told me about this film last year and I rejected the film (silly me). After people kept telling me about how classic it was, I am glad that I gave it a try. I do wish I could have believed him ages ago though.<br/><br/>I've heard Platnuim Dunes is gonna remake this and say ""they're gonna be extra careful since it's a classic"". We'll just have to wait and see. I mean I don't mind some of PD's films but ""Rosemary's Baby"" doesn't need to be touched.<br/><br/>I'm gonna top this review down, giving Rosemary's Baby a 9.5/10"

","Pardon my ignorance.<br/><br/>When an actor of Mia Farrow's calibre decides to act in a movie after a year from his previous release, and when you have a massive production house backing your movie with a director whose had two back to back hits, You tend to expect a lot from a movie.<br/><br/>But instead what you get is 2 hours of absolute rubbish.<br/><br/>The facts are simple. Add a Lil bit of humour to a pathetic story and publicise it well and let the cash registers ring, because its the year end and there a billion fans of Farrow, who have been waiting so impatiently for his next movie for over a year, so anything she signs is bound to be an instant hit. And that has been the case for most of his movies for the past decade. Even THE GREAT GASBY cashed in a lot in the first week.<br/><br/>What mystifies me more is the way Polanski went about publicising this movie? I am still confused and a bit dazzled as to what was the link between the story of the movie and Farrow touring NYC as your everyday people.<br/><br/>What mystifies me even more as to what made choose her this movie. There was nothing even close to what you would call challenging in this film, considering her previous performances.<br/><br/>Lets start with his character Rosemary, a college student . Lets be honest, she has played that in so many movies that she could now do that in her sleep. A free thinker who studies and preaches education by her own rules and practicality. Funny why does ""Zinda Laash"" just keep springing to my mind. The only difference being Deeba Begum and Rosemary was that Deeba was practising medicine in that movie and Rosemary is a housewife.<br/><br/>There were many one-liners that i heard giggles in the theatre, but not many of them realise that they are so 2 thousand late.<br/><br/>Like for instance the NASA pen scene or even the best gag of the film the Satan speech are lifted from either stand-ups or foreign movies.<br/><br/>It was like watching a blend of Zinda Laash, Rang De Basanti,Patch Adams, Munnabhai (the 1971 one because that too was inspired by Zinda Laash), Patch Adams & Taare Zameen Par together.<br/><br/>And it was Shambolic mixture to be honest. Even the theme song ""give me some sunshine"" is inspired by an old Hindi ghazal. And i am really annoyed that nobody else realised that. Probably because the language has changed. So i will have to spell it out to you, compare the lyrics of this song and a timeless classic by jagjit singh, ""Woh Kaagaz Ki Kashti"", and u will begin to realise, that every bit of this movie is either inspired or lifted from one or the other, in the same manner Ghajini was inspired from a certain Christopher Nolan film.<br/><br/>Yes i did find something that i liked in the movie, and that is only one shot from the entire movie, although very predictable, but the scene in which the infants eye is revealed to be a reptilian really blew me away.<br/><br/>With THE PIANO PPLAYER , Polanski stamped his mark of brilliance in many ways. As a director, a story writer and a story teller. It was refreshing and unpredictable. Even the first of the Apartment series had plenty of laughs and frowns although that too was mostly an englishised version of Zinda Lagaan.<br/><br/>Mr, Polanski, move over the Zinda Lagaan hangover now. Its high time.<br/><br/>I am sure you might find many other movies in Bollywood, that still haven't been Englishanised.<br/><br/>And once again pardon my ignorance."

","The film is based on the best-selling horror novel Rosemary's Baby (1967) which is wrote by Ira Levin and Roman Polanski shoot-ed the novel as a film. the movie consists of satanic material. Thinking of the earlier era this film is so good we don't compare the old fashioned movie with movies in these days. But ı think this movie isn't kind of horror ı think it is thriller. the scope the director and the cast of the film is remarkable. especially Mia Farrow's performance is good everything happens to her happens me. she acted so real with the help of the Polanski. Polanski is brilliant director. Polanski creates a gloomy, isolated and chilling mood especially with the scary lullaby. Rosemary's dreams are so creepy. . The finest ever part is ability to attract the attention without blood and violence. . Roman Polanski has made many, movie like Chinatown the pianist Oliver twist the ninth gate. I envy of him because he is a genius. I wanna tell u the scope of the film a little the movie about a new couple Rosemary Woodhouse and Guy Woodhouse move into apartment in new York. The apartment name is Bramford, which is a Gothic, 19th century New York City apartment building with a history of unsavory tenants and mysterious events. They meet new people who are their neighbors on a sudden rosemary is a pregnant. Due to old couple neighbor her pregnancy is so painful. After the painful pregnancy she learned everything about this oddness. She learned the truth which was shocked her Guy who is her husband joined the satanic group for the money and fame and he allows the wife has a devil's son. Unfortunately I don't like the last scene of the movie it didn't satisfy me enough. I wanna see more shocking scenes at the end of the movie but I offer everyone to watch this movie because it is a classic=)"

","If this movie was made in 2011, it would have received a 5.5/10 rating. Please don't be fooled by the genre listed in as horror because it simply isn't. I was not scared, no chills or thrills, just plain bored. If you want to watch horror, I'd recommend the classics Exorcist, Omen or The Shining. Now watch that and see if you can sleep with your lights on. I was all fired up to be on the edge of my seat, but as the movie progressed I felt there wasn't going to be anything scary, a little bit of mystery yes since Rosemary does not know whether she is delusional or her neighbors are really out to get her baby., but that's about it. The ending is a little lame too. After a watching a movie for nearly 2 hours long you will expect a scarier ending."
"udemir92","Null","0","1","8 June 2011"," A Perfect Horror Movie
","Rosemary's Baby is a brooding, perfect film, filled with the sense of unthinkable danger and horror and thought one of the most successful of its kind. The brilliance of the film is that it takes this realistic basis and builds on it with supernatural metaphors that make pregnancy a rich and strange condition. I think this is a very powerful, and really strange, horror movie. Every horror fan who loves such kind of films should see this film at least once. This film is a horror classic tells the story of a young woman who is manipulated by her husband and neighbors until she carries Satan's baby. These films reinforce the concept that evil is inherently outside of us. It nameable, definable, and recognizable, rather than extreme result of human stupidity. In such movies, these films demonize sex and science. All of these themes are present in this film. The film is really well-planned. Rosemary throughout the film allows her doubts to be our doubts, her suspicions ours, and ultimately her horrors ours. The clues are so well-placed that we can't be entirely sure who to trust until the evidence helps us to do. Her performance is incredible, as she embodies this character with a commitment that we rarely see these days. The way that Rosemary's Baby exposes male dominance over women's reproductive systems certainly puts it in that canon. and Mia Farrow's soft, high-pitched voice and vulnerable performance make her character's rape, both literally, physically, and emotionally. This is a fantastic film, but it as everyone think this film culturally performs in dangerous and insidious ways. Throughout the film, you sometimes feel confused but as the events grow, you begin to understand what is going on in the film."

When I was watching, I always tried to figure out what would be happen in the end of the movie and I think everybody who watches the movie did it, too. After I had watched the film, I searched it from the Wikipedia and I realize that it is originally based on a book which is published in 1967. <br/><br/>I think the leading actress Mia Farrow, called as Rosemary Woodhouse in the movie, acted successfully and makes me satisfied with her acting. And the other thing is that the sound of the movie affected me deeply. So, I think one of the reasons that the movie influence audience is its awesome sound.<br/><br/>The movie centers on Rosemary Woodhouse whose husband is a struggling actor. This young couple move into the Bramford which is mentioned that there was a disturbing history involving witchcraft and murder. In spite of this rumor, they determine to stay there. After they move, they are welcomed by Minnie and Roman Castevet, an eccentric elderly couple. Rosemary finds them strange and absurd, but Guy is happy with being them and frequent visits them. Rosemary has wanted a children but her husband thinks that it is early for this responsibility. And he tells to Rosemary that they will make children after he is more established.

","This film was quite beautiful. In fact, it is the best old movie I've ever watched. In my opinion old movies are not worth to watch. But this is quite different. Some scenes made me excited and some scenes made me upset. Also, its mystery was a breath taking thing. Plot was quite good. There was a woman named Rosemary and she was pregnant. She was married with a man named guy. They are happy with their marriages. This film also shows marriage relation. In the beginning I suspected old couple that are neighbor of Rosemary. That turned out to be true. They were some kind of witches. She was used for satanic rituals.<br/><br/>what I didn't like in this film is that when Rosemary learns what happens, she goes to Dr.Hill. Going to the police or her family town would be more reasonable. And the other thing, she didn't realize anything when she lost too weight. And she didn't realize anything until she read the book. Furthermore, I was excited when Rosemary started to do some research about what was going on. I was curious whether she could find or not. she found but it was late. The ending was so bad. There was no sign about what happened when Rosemary found her baby. Did she attend the group or what? Divorcing her husband and leaving the city with her baby would be a good end. I suppose this movie is useful because it shows old times, old people, old houses etc. While watching, it takes us to 1960s.<br/><br/>I was thrilled, I was excited and I saw that the people around us even our partner may have two faces.

","I watched Rosemary's Baby film in the listening and pronunciation lesson the instructor of which is Mustafa Tekin for the first time. The director Roman Polanski's most famous film The Rosemary's Baby is one of the most effective horror films ever made. This really is a creepy little film and well worth a watch even now. It is disturbing, thought provoking, and incredibly well written movie and it is a good example of horror done for the sake of story rather than a few simple scares. It has a terrific cast, and amazing story. This movie is a horror classic which tells the story of a young woman who is manipulated and subjugated by her husband and ultra-creepy neighbors until she carries Satan's baby to term. The final scene is one of the more disturbing in any film and there is not a true hero, leaving the world in doubt which is rare for a film like this. Furthermore, it was directed brilliantly for optimum suspense. Although it was made in 1968, scenes of films are very effective. For example; the moment that breaks my heart is Guy helping Rosemary to bed after the poison dessert and she falls in the hallway. It is the most dramatic and effective scene of the film for me. In addition to these, families should keep their children away this scary classic movie. Because this film deals with pregnancy and adult sexuality. The characters practice satanic rituals, make bargains with the devil, drink alcohol. If you have not watched Rosemary's Baby, you should watch it right away. This film should be watched. Do not ask me why I should watch this movie. Just watch that ending though and you will understand why it is worth watching. I am sure that you will like it!"
"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","31 March 2011"," Tormenting and agonising in all the right ways, Polanski's chiller about a woman's forlorn descent into grim territory makes for slow burning, strained viewing.
","Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is imbued with this underpinning sense of terror; this sense of dread or horror at what 'might' be, it is a remarkably well played horror/thriller near faultlessly encompassing both the natural and the supernatural within one realm of a world but always playing everything straight-faced and in a gruesomely suggestive way. The text is a pure and unadulterated piece, so much so that it is living proof that precisely why it is that keeping everything in suspense and refraining from necessarily showing your contents in all its inglory is a million times more effective than full on, bloody horror violence and petty 'jumps' along the way to an obligatory genre denouement. The film's top trump might very well be in the way its director flawlessly maintains that balance much later on in the film by the time certain reveals and revelations have unfolded; in a lesser film the foreplay and suggestion prior to the shocking disclosure might very well have been the film's substantial core, but instead of wilting for a final act of frills-and-spills of whatever nature, Rosemary's Baby arguably pushes on from its provocative routes and steps up a gear into more agonising territory, in what is rather-an impressive demonstration of construction and tempo to a film of this ilk. <br/><br/>The film is a quite engrossing drama, a film teasing and bedeviling the audience with two realities, one of which would lead one to assume it is a gritty, urban and somewhat everyday drama set in New York City about a woman slowly loosing her mind as she balances the moving into a new apartment; the pressures with some neighbours she comes to be wary of and the desiring of motherhood which leads onto pregnancy. Is it the bustle of the city driving her mad, or is there something seedier going on; something more broadly linked to things of a more unworldly nature unfolding within this very worldly zone. The film begins with the Woodhouse's searching out a new abode within which to live, with the aim to turn their family of two into a family of three. The Woodhouse's are made up of the titular Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, and her husband Guy (Cassavetes); people with the ability to, we feel, afford the high-life given the exquisite nature of the apartment they are shown around: a porter in the elevator complimenting the Beethoven music playing somewhere within the complex once inside the apartment proper and the generally rich nature of the interior furnishing. But we are all informed of some prior nastiness that once happened in the apartment and a wardrobe seemingly blocking something to great convenience offers slight distrust.<br/><br/>There is a moment, eventually doubling up for the catalyst of what later transpires, in which Rosemary will admit to those listening of a terrifying dream she had; a dream in which she was situated on a dock wearing next to nothing as a ship about to set off on a doomed cruise sat perched awaiting boarding just ahead of her. The notion of feeling bare or vulnerable whilst situated at a locale upon which the beginnings of what are usually long, arduous journeys appearing prominent; the ship itself appearing metaphorically as the literal apartment purchase, those of whom are allowed on linked directly to class and those within a class able to afford to move into such spaces – the underlying factor being that what lies ahead on this cruise or journey is mandatory trouble and strife, the precise things which plague Rosemary's life once she has gotten herself into this true-to-life nightmare. <br/><br/>Ploanski allows for things to brood before hitting us with any counter punches he mostly certainly has up his sleeve; a young girl named Terry bonds well with Rosemary, but this is not a character study between two girls and the quaint friendship they strike up; the Castevet family neighbours named Roman (Blackmer) and Minnie (Gordon) come to infiltrate the lives of Rosemary and Guy, much to Rosemary's disdain; but this isn't necessarily a character drama about numerous people whom live and integrate with one another in a jolly fashion on grounded terms within a mere New York apartment block. The film allows for raw human behaviour, Guy's attitudes and reactions to the Castevet's presence or demands shifting naturally enough without bringing to awares any seedier side to the agreements he's actually striking up with them, the likes of which subsequent viewings might reveal more clearly, as intense or obvious underhanded tactics. By the time Rosemary's titular baby has been conceived and is known to be on the way, natural human behaviour is captured as somewhat unnatural, or at least made so that the audience might be drawn towards assuming it to be unnatural – cravings for specific foods; immense weight loss; pains and paranoia each straddling a fine line between what might be uneasily typical or just disturbingly atypical behaviour going on to contribute to a nastier cause. <br/><br/>Polanksi keeps the tension, terror and paranoia wrenched up to some near-unbearable levels; the fact that certain people around Rosemary, whom she's known for varying degrees of time and most of whom come into contact with the Castevet's, appear to come to sticky ends is a predominant item; the working out of various clues and the shifting of different notions into place occupying most of the film's somewhat agonising crucible. The end result is a superior thriller revolving around the potentially distressing, but with the underlying source of terror being the fear of one's accuracy in seeing through such matters and where that would then place them; culminating in a distinguished piece."

I enjoyed the original ending, however, i thought it would have been really interesting to see Rosemary take action into her own hands and destroy the devil child as opposed to be a pussy and let it slide. What the old witches did was pretty effed up, and it would only be fair for Rosemary to FSU and grab the baby out of the black bassinet and maybe make a run for it, sacrificing her life as well as the demon child's life and possibly jump out the window considering there was no where else to run without someone grabbing her.

","The movie starts with a very soothing lullaby which has a very calming effect on the viewer - but that is the only thing 'calm' about the movie. Once Again, a psychological thriller, Polanski style, this movie is the very best in it's genre. The plot revolves around Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) who come to live in an apartment which has very strange neighbors, one of them being the old couple of Roman and Minnie Castevet( Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon). Initially, they appear to be very good as neighbors, almost playing the role of parents to the young couple. Guy likes them and spends a lot of time with them whereas Rosemary does not like their constant intervention in their married life.Things change drastically when Rosemary becomes pregnant. Certain things and events happening to and around her makes her believe that her baby is in danger. Her fears, her attempt to save her child and the end outcome constitutes the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is a pure Polanski style master-piece. His obsession of seeing woman naked and raped (Even though it is a hallucination or a nightmare) is continued in this movie. But all this perversion is for a reason which makes the viewer truly understand his intentions. On the acting front, Mia Farrow has done a superb job. After watching the movie, I felt no other actress could have played Rosemary better than her. The other actors fit the bill perfectly. Overall, not suited for all, but one of the greatest movies ever.<br/><br/>Rating :9/10"

","Rosemary's Baby was recommended to me by a friend who is fan of horror cinema. I am personally not a horror fan, but this does have Roman Polanski directing it, and I do like films like The Exorcist and The Omen. I prefer those films, but Rosemary's Baby is still pretty good, taking a more down to Earth approach, despite its more supernatural themes.<br/><br/>Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) are a young couple living in New York. Guy is an actor, who had some work in plays and in TV ads. They find a nice large apartment in a more historic building and move in quickly. They befriend an elderly couple, Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). But Rosemary's old friend tells them of weirds things that happened in the building. Rosemary and Guy try for a baby. She becomes pregnant, and ends up seeing one of best doctor's in New York. But it is a difficult pregnancy, suffering a lot of pain, becoming very weak and pale and Rosemary even ends up doing strangle things like eating raw meat. Rosemary ends ups suspecting a conspiracy, hearing weird chanting and seeing people getting hurt. She does whatever she can to protect her unborn baby.<br/><br/>Rosemary's Baby is a watershed film in the world of horror cinema. It proved that horror films could be very well done, and led to The Exorcist and The Omen being made: film following similar themes. It also shows that proper filmmakers can do horror films. Polanski takes a more subtle approach to the film, making it more as a thriller then a horror. Most of the supernatural elements can be logically explained. This is a film that makes you think and linger in your head rather then getting scared throughout it. The ending has an excellent twist ending to the film, giving Rosemary's Baby a haunting quality. Like any good horror film, there is a major fear that people could relate to. The theme out this is about what could go wrong with a pregnancy and doing everything you can to protect your child. I sure any parent could relate to that. There is also the theme of paranoid, with the feeling that the world is out to get you. There is also the use religious ideas, like Catholicism, the Occult and Witchcraft, and of a marriage which isn't that stable. Another major feature of any good horror film is compelling characters which you actually care about. You do care for Rosemary who is a nice woman who is forced into a dark world. You want her to succeed in protecting her child. You know something is wrong with the other characters in the film, and slowly see their game. They are villains you can truly dislike.<br/><br/>There are good scenes, and excellent camera by Polanski. I like scenes in films where the camera follows the character. There are some haunting scenes where you think about the horror of it later. Polanski did not go for cheap scares.<br/><br/>A pretty good film. 4 out of 5."

There are many subtleties throughout the film that as a viewer you have to pay close attention to if you want to get the true greatness of this magnificent film.

Many may say during the 60's this was the best horror film made maybe in terms psychologically, yet my pick is 1960's ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>Anyway the story is set in New York city a couple Rosemary(Mia Farrow)and Guy(John Cassavetes)just have moved into a high rise luxury apartment building and Guy is a struggling actor trying to make it from commercials and plays to the big time of studio pictures. As like all couples settling down they want to start a family only soon they realize after being taken in strange things happen like unexpected tenants deaths. Most striking which foreshadows the viewer and shows symbols so well is the weird and frightening dreams that Rosemary starts to have as is it confusion and worry for a first time mother just who's baby is it she's having.<br/><br/>Overall pretty good film that keeps you intrigued with the crazy and foreshadowing type dreams proving that really a lot in life can be strangely cursed.

One can argue that it's your soul and you can do what you want with it and then it's just you who has to suffer the consequences of your decision.<br/><br/>But what makes ""Rosemary's Baby"" so disturbing is that a man doesn't sell his own soul, he sells someone else's soul. Guy Woodhouse makes a pact with a coven of witches to have his wife become the mother of the devil's child and in return he becomes a success. He reaps the benefits of the deal he makes, yet it is his wife who suffers for it.<br/><br/>Rosemary tries to stop all the things that are happening to her but she is stymied at every turn; the witches' power and scope is too broad and far-reaching. She doesn't know who to trust. Anyone who tries to help her gets struck down. Her husband, who should be the one she can trust the most, turns out to be the one she should trust the least.<br/><br/>Once her baby is born she is initially repulsed by its appearance when she realizes who this child really is, but then the oh-so-strong maternal instinct takes over and she sees him only as her child, whom she loves, regardless. It makes you wonder if things might have been different had Rosemary been in on the plot all along.<br/><br/>Younger folks today will find all sorts of problems with the story: why didn't she just stop drinking that awful stuff? Why didn't she just go to the emergency room?

Everything around Rosemary appears okay on the surface, but gradually little ""clues"" begin to indicate that something more sinister may actually be taking place behind closed doors. Or perhaps it isn't. The scary thing is that Rosemary doesn't really know, and perhaps she can't even trust her own mind.<br/><br/>I have heard allusions to ""Rosemary's Baby"" for years, so I had some idea of what it was about, but I wasn't really prepared for this film. Most of the terror in this movie lies in what is not seen but only suspected. Rosemary's fears seem justified, but are they? The tension builds as we realize that Rosemary is completely alone and doomed in her struggle against something which is possibly unspeakably evil.<br/><br/>I wonder if religious and nonreligious people view this film differently. Well, as a Christian, I could accept the premise as possible and truly revolting. Days after seeing this film, certain scenes still come to mind which make me shudder.<br/><br/>As a movie devoid of gore but nevertheless successful in creating an atmosphere of dread, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is the most elegant horror film I have ever seen and one of the very best. I can't find a reason to rate it less than a 10."

","When people ask me what my two favorite films are, Rosemary's Baby and Carrie always come to mind. The fact that they are both supernatural in subject matter is a coincidence, I love them for other reasons first.<br/><br/>RB is a brilliant example of a movie that is so faithful to the novel that it becomes a great work in and of itself. I can't help but think William Castle (the original choice for director) would have done something entirely different with it. Polanski saw the possibility to make something grand and timely out of it, it's practically a detailed time capsule of the year it was made. In a way it represents the cultural upheaval America was going through and the director makes a definite statement, casting senior citizens as evil doers. (He tried it again later with The Tenant, and it doesn't work nearly as well) Rosemary is modern in a naive way, she goes for all the current styles and trends, most notably evident when she redecorates that huge apartment (symbolic of ""covering over"" old ways) and the Sassoon hairstyle she gets, which makes her look even more gaunt and drawn as her pregnancy wears on.<br/><br/>Polanski specifically wanted familiar old Hollywood actors in the film and drew sketches based on what he thought they should look like. When they showed up, each character actor resembled his sketches in a bizarrely coincidental way. Just the fact that Patsy Kelly and Hope Summers (Clara on the Andy Griffith Show) are both wicked witches along with their Queen Bee, Ruth Gordon, gives it an added depth and contributes to the blackest of humor that runs throughout the film. One of my favorite scenes is when Farrow and Gordon are doing the dishes after dinner. Gordon is asking her innocent questions on the surface, but her intent is pure malice.<br/><br/>Farrow was a trooper to say the least. She was served divorce papers on set by Sinatra who hated the idea his little weak waif of a wife was working.<br/><br/>The entire thing could have tipped over into camp very easily, but it doesn't. Everyone concerned gives it their all. Somehow Polanski managed to make us believe; we're genuinely terrified for Rosemary in a situation that if looked at objectively, is ridiculous. The end scene, rather than tie everything up in a neat little bow, careens off into a horrible outcome, as if to say ""You thought the part you saw was bad, just imagine what it's going to be like"" Brilliant, brilliant film.<br/><br/>Among the thousands of tidbits of trivia about the film, I love the one about Tony Curtis being the voice of the actor on the phone that's struck blind. During filming Farrow didn't know who it was on the phone, and Polanski wanted her reaction to be puzzled in trying to recognize it."

","I have watched this film so many times and never get tired of it. It is a perfectly executed horror film where the best material met the best director. Polanski can suggest menace with just an open doorway and a cloud of cigar smoke. He lets the audience imagine, which is what computerised terrors never do. Mia Farrow was the epitome of vulnerable beauty. Ruth Gorden is malevolent and funny, grotesque but believable , like some awful clucking hen that feeds on human flesh. Of course Polanski was handed a brilliant idea, but he tells the story with such craftsmanship. The supernatural enfolds within an everyday domestic setting but still remains credible. Brilliant. If you have never seen this movie you are in for a treat. As time goes by and we see so many poor horror films, this movie just gets better and better."

(The name is an anagram!).The problem is, they aren't just nosy neighbors. They appear to be part of a coven, which is interested in Rosemary's baby, and not for good reasons.<br/><br/>John Cassavetes is, as usual, menacing and excellent as Rosemary's husband, a man who needs a break in show business, and will need to make a deal with Satan to get it. Congratulations to Polanski for an excellent theme, suspense and acting which conveys perfectly to the screen. 10/10."

","Understanding that the horror is internalized within the story itself and expressed through the mundaneness of the actors' expressions, I was not successfully horrified, yet I was successfully enthralled. I found the villainy and situations to be tense and even irksome, which is a word one doesn't often use when referring to a reaction to a film. The film's later revelations are not necessarily scary but alternately intense and almost humorous, almost like a Charlie Kaufman script.<br/><br/>Whatever the intentions of the film, whether to be a horror film, an off-putting blend of genres and techniques, or a thriller, it has an effect above that of many of the scariest horror movies, not because it's a more consuming effect that being genuinely scared in the way that Psycho or Saw scare, but because it's an effect that is more complex, thus more complex to achieve. At first, I was put off by the scale of the film-making, which expresses its big budget, large cinematographic scope, and less of an insular or atmospheric environment one would imagine being necessary to be successfully creepy. Now I can see that it was all a part of Polanski's vision."

","Given the well-documented trauma that enveloped his personal life as the Swinging Sixties were drawing to a close, it's perhaps unsurprising that Polanski chose to oversee a loose trilogy about madness taking hold in grim city environs. Of the three films in that canon, my personal preference leans toward ""The Tenant"", but ""Rosemary's Baby"" still remains an unnerving peephole that casts its view over urban paranoia.<br/><br/>It's a film that best rewards repeat viewing, as the subtle intricacies of the script can be assimilated properly once the viewer is made fully aware of the diabolical plot at the film's end. If you're at all interested in the philosophies of mind-control or subjugation, then the horror may well deepen. Leave out the supernatural details which are specific to this story, and you'll nevertheless find that 'insistent coercion' is a hallmark of many dubious sects across the world.<br/><br/>When he gets it right, Polanski is a master at immersing his audience in the fears of the character on screen. If you're a person who is susceptible to shivers brought on by isolation, then after seeing this you may need to sleep with the light on for awhile..."

","that this is not a real horror film, because it has nothing in it that makes a real horror film, a real horror film. No gore, no slashing, no blood, no scare tactics. Then again I have to say, this is just graphic BS that doesn't really help develop and carry the story. That's why most horror films of such nature are naive and barely watchable.<br/><br/>There are only a few real horror stories out there. Now horror takes place at the same location that sex takes place: in your head. The question is what do you need to get stimulated? To get the ball rolling? The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby are by far the best horror films ever made. They stimulate you on the intellectual part of the spectrum and create an unmatchable horror experience within you, there where it hurts the most. Not the outside, the flesh and gore part, but the psyche, that part that never rests. The part that haunts you at night when you're all by yourself, all alone. Rosemary's Baby terrifies you long after you've watched the film. And it'll come back to haunt you again and in reality it will never disappear.<br/><br/>As opposed to gore stuff, which you forget within the next few days after watching such a film. Visual effects are very weak compared to psychological effects. In my opinion every film company should have a psycho-FX department, because that's where the story really lives, the horror, the nightmare, the possibility of such a horrible thing actually being real.<br/><br/>Save your pigs blood and use your imagination, just like when you think of some one else while you're having sex with your girlfriend. Isn't that the best? That same place is where the true horror takes place. And this film totally hit the bullseye!<br/><br/>(To finish the comparison: gory, graphical films are like masturbation.

I cannot sympathize with girls like Rosemary, because it's in row with my convictions, but the actors are really good here, and all of them. The theme of love was overpowering. Love for husband, child. Hmm, the child above all. The independent love with the sacrifice of the very own personal grounds upon which all had been built in past, was touching and hurting. It's so hard to bring it here in our lives. Farrow and Cassavetes made me believe they were in trouble as well as their support did /Gordon, Blackmer, Evans/. Occasionally Mia Farrow was overly realistic so that I was ready to sign off but I didn't. /though I must confess, the name, Mia that is, has a reservation for a soft spot in my heart/.

","Rosemary's Baby (1968) was a film that's based upon a best selling novel written by Ira Levin. Unlike most novels that were made into movies, this film follows the book very closely. They're very similar except Roman Polaski adds an aura of paranoia and isolation to the film. Mia Farrow stars as a young bride who's dealing with her marriage and her husband (an aspiring actor played by John Cassavetes) who's looking for the right apartment for the young couple. They find the right place in an old complex that caters to older couples. John falls in love with the odd elderly neighbors and becomes friends whilst Mia is a little leery at first but becomes friends with them as well. But when a series of strange occurrences that seem to benefit John and the weird homemade brew the neighbor women bring Mia to drink when they learn about her pregnancy gives her second thoughts about the new apartment and their ever so friendly elderly neighbors.<br/><br/>When Mia begins to hear strange sounds and waking up during a very bad dream drives her to the brink of madness. The isolation she feels because of the age differences of her neighbors, the pregnancy and John's new attitude towards religion and life in general pushes her further and further. Soon she learns about the awful truth about the tenants in her building from an old friend (who's illness and death drives Mia batty). She tries to leave the circle of her husband and neighbors but she realizes no matter where she goes they always manage to find her. By the end of the film she's too far gone and can do nothing more but accept her fate and learn to live with it. <br/><br/>Classic horror. Paranoia and the occult has never been captured like this before. Roman Polanski redefined the genre with this movie and it's success has catapult him even further up the Hollywood charts. That is until personal tragedy brings him back down to reality.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","After putting this film off for some time, mainly due to my strong dislike for any religion-related material, I finally pulled myself together and watched it. I'm glad I did. Very, very glad. From the opening credits, which feature a chilling lullaby, I was hooked. The film is effective without actually showing us anything particularly scary... which is quite an achievement. I don't believe I've seen something like this outside of a Hitchcock film. The basic idea behind this movie is great. The way everything is merely hinted at, never shown directly is incredibly effective, and the film is thoroughly chilling and disturbing. The plot is very good, very involving and interesting throughout the films running time of just over two hours. The pacing is great, in fact, this is arguably Polanski's best paced film. Then again, I haven't seen all of his films, but still... I was never bored, not for a second. The film didn't overstay its welcome. The acting was mostly great, but there are one or two performances by the supporting cast that seem... off, somehow. Nothing big, though. The characters are very well-written, interesting and credible. One thing that bothered me a little was how the only truly likable character was Rosemary... even her boyfriend was annoying, I thought. Maybe that's just me, though. I loved how the plot evolved, and really enjoyed all the little signs given throughout the film, leading up to the end... which still manages to surprise the viewer. I certainly didn't see that ending coming. I haven't read the book which this film is based upon, but from what I hear, it's a very close adaptation. Do yourself a favor, don't ask anyone what the film is about, because they might reveal too much, and just rent or borrow this and watch it. Any fan of atmospheric horror should love this film, despite of the few shortcomings it has(among them is Polanski's love for long takes, which at times get tedious and some of the dialog being somewhat... poorly written). I recommend this to any fan of Roman Polanski, atmosphere in horror flicks and/or any of the actors. Just be prepared for some seriously disturbing stuff, even if it isn't explicitly shown. 8/10"

The story centers on Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her husband Guy (the late Cassavetes), two rich New Yorkers who move into a flashy downtown apartment complex with a checkered reputation.  The apartment is also inhabited by two odd older neighbors (wonderfully played by Gordon and Blackmer).  How of course, may be more than they seem.<br/><br/>What ensues is not so much horror, more like sustained psychological tension.  Polanski does not cheat us with showy effects and creatures that jump out of the wall, instead he relies on mood, innuendo, and above all the magnificent Farrow.<br/><br/>What strikes a viewer twenty-five years after the films release is the fact that a film like this would have little chance of being made today.  It is almost like a stage play, as the action unfolds almost exclusively in the cavernous apartment of Rosemary.  The mastery of Polanski is that he uses this too his advantage.

I just want to tell them this:<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the final scene or' the climax scene',why? Well, as you know it RB is a mix of Psychological  and supernatural subjects But more important,RB is a GOTHIC film from a Gothic minded absurdist:ROMAN POLANSKI Ok, you are,I guess, aware of all of this ,the final scene is part of a polanskian universe-his filmography and the characters of his earlier films from the sixties came from this `universe'-- according to which the probability of the facts leans in a particular logic of the characters. In his pre-.RB film, CUL DE SAC(1965),POLANSKI present us a particular scene:<br/><br/>We see a car beached in a coast starts to be invaded by the water, even in this situation, the man does not leave his car facing the risk of suffocating, perhaps he thinks that nothing bad can happen to him or not to conceive the possibility on the matter of doing something without the aid of his companion who, being kilometers away of the place, obvious  cannot listen to his cry for help .or another scene the couple that lives in the taken castle accepts the interference of the new guest as something inexorable that simply must be assimilated. With the code maintained in the absurd one, Polanski installs the possibility of any situation that, NO MATTER its degree of absurdity, will not be questioned by the protagonists. This attitude is use in an inverse way  in Rosemary's baby(1968)at first she fights against the adversities that alter her normal course of her life.(contrary to Cul de sac character,she even seeks help to her former doctor But ,he,of course,doesn't believe her'story').<br/><br/>Remember her as a Gothic heroine,To me ,'the crib scene' got to do with that inexorable acceptance I've mentioned you before(the absurdistic VIEW) and about  her strong motherhood instinct almost obsessive even if the child she nurtures would be the son of the devil(supernatural)<br/><br/>To show this at the end is not a treason because we already  got `hints'of witchcraft in earlier scenes,Remember the absurd theory? Of course the `paranoia' mentioned is interesting for the plot,To me it's difficult to believe that people didn't knew(back in the sixties) that at the end her suspected paranoia is not precisely a `paranoia'<br/><br/>In the  absurdistic gothic world nothing is safe or logical or `realistic' even if it looks like For that reason Rosemary's Baby final scene is appropriate and truthful to this particular universe. The pessimism just fits very well too because in all of Polanski films the protagonist's isolation is one of their characteristic.As TERRENCE RAFFERTY said : Rosemary's Baby"" seems less a lurid shocker than a kind of boldly stylized existential fable: Hell really is other people, especially when they are people determined to impose themselves on weaker creatures. Poor Rosemary is like a sick lamb separated from her flock by a pack of ravening wolves.'<br/><br/>Is John Huston's character in CHINATOWN one of those old wolves too?<br/><br/><br/><br/>(`Hire myself to whom?

","Rosemary's baby suggests INDOOR as a place for evil plots. Buildings as the VILLAIN. Something sinister happens in close doors. At the beginning the film introduce us to the apartment's reputation:<br/><br/>During a dinner invitation with their friend Edward ""Hutch"" Hutchins (Maurice Evans), he warns them of the apartment building's notorious, sordid and unsavory reputation for witchcraft and cannibalism over 50 years earlier: <br/><br/>
Are you aware that the Bramford had a rather unpleasant reputation around the turn of the century? It's where the Trench sisters conducted their little dietary experiments. And Keith Kennedy held his parties. Adrian Marcato lived there too...The Trench sisters were two proper Victorian ladies - they cooked and ate several young children including a niece...Adrian Marcato practiced witchcraft. He made quite a splash in the 90s by announcing that he'd conjured up the living devil. Apparently, people believed him so they attacked and nearly killed him in the lobby of the Bramford...Later, the Keith Kennedy business began and by the 20s, the house was half empty...World War II filled the house up again...They called it Black Bramford...This house has a high incidence of unpleasant happenings. In '59, a dead infant was found wrapped in newspaper in the basement...<br/><br/>
Another similar `cursed Buildings' we find in films like Suspiria (1977) and especially Inferno (1980) portray buildings in some form of supernatural collusion against the protagonist. Phenomena (1985) picks up on the dormitory persecution theme with a different, inverse-Psycho (1960) explanation. In Phenomena, we expect a monkey to be the killer and transfer our suspicion to the son because they are similar in size, only to find that it is really the mother who is the killer."

","Couple of spoilers<br/><br/>This great film has a sickening story.  It's among the most scary films of all time. It made me squirm for days as any good horror film causing me to ask what if' questions about the plot.  The characters are believable.  All the actors played their parts perfectly.  They are forward and open.  They remind me of some disarming elderly people from a church congregation.  This openness is what I think makes this film so scary as it is contrasted with a lot of the unknown.   Sometimes, there is comic relief at the same time of insane fear.  I think it outlines three levels of fear: 1.Knowing the unknown, 2.knowing that others know what you know and then 3.the helpless misery of not being able to change the circumstances by oneself, for it is in the spirit world and would be in vain.  Slight Spoiler: It's amazing how all the stuff comes together at the end. Details are cleverly crafted. <br/><br/>
Some films are a necessary evil.  I think this film in particular is a must see that connects with the Hitchcock-ian style era horror and gives birth to the neo-gothic demonic horror that we experienced in say, (The Exorcist, 1973) or (The Omen, 1976).  I just can't figure out why films of this genre seem to include the element of Catholicism.<br/><br/>Slight Spoiler: The movie looks a bit like what (The Rocky Horror Picture Show, 1975) might possibly have based its satire on."

However, just about every woman I know who has seen this has had nightmares from it.  Oh, well, their loss. ""The Omen"" did a far better job of being both creepy and shocking.

","Really Creepy. Even Today.  This 1968 Roman Polanski directed classic of the macabre is a brilliantly terrifying excursion into modern day NYC & the lives of a newlywedded young couple.  What makes this movie work so well is the off-beat, hippie-ish way in which its told. It made it seem so much more believable & it made the commonly seen, cliched horror films of the day looked uninspired & unsophisticated by camparison. Both this film and the best-selling novel by Ira Levin were phenomenally popular with the masses back in the late sixties. I can remember my mom reading the book & telling me how scary the movie was - which I was too young young to see owing to its rating.  I thought Mia Farrow's portrait of the title character was finel y etched and that she put a lot of ""feeling"" into her unusual role.  John Cassevettes does fine as Guy.  Ruth Gordon, hammy and hilarious, steals the show as Minnie Castevet, the eccentric nosey neighbour. She won her best supporting AA for this: ""I can't tell ya how encouragin' a thing like this is at my age"" should told the academy during her acceptance speech.  Her playing of Minnie, when seen today, borders on being overdone in some respects, especially when she makes those animated faces while eating & serving up cake in her apartment.  Her apathetic attitude toward the death of the dope addict girl cracks me up: ""Oh, yeaah"" * but her ""nude"" scene is a creepy turnabout for her character. Sidney Blackmer is excellent as her ""fascinating"" husband while Ralph Bellamy easily gives his finest latter-day performance as Rosemary's ""concerned"" doctor.  A MUST for horror fans!"

","I watched this on ""Bravo"" last week after wanting to see it for years, and I have to say that I was very impressed. The acting is wonderful - Mia Farrow is superb as the terrified Rosemary, Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon are wonderful as the enjoyably evil (or is it evilly enjoyable?) Roman and Minnie Castevet. <br/><br/>""Rosemary's Baby"" is, like I said, the way that a real horror movie should be. There's a story, a plot, and not a bunch of blood and gore, along with a big-breasted girl who can't act running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door. The movie grabs you in, and it doesn't let you go until the end.<br/><br/>Rosemary Woodhouse is fragile. She's a scared young woman who's not sure of what's going on inside her. She describes the early stages of her pregnancy as 'feeling like there's a wire inside her that's tightening'. Minnie, the sweet old lady across the hall is nurturing and maternal, bringing Rosemary an herb-spiked drink every day. She's seeing the best OB/GYN in New York, the kindly old Jewish doctor. But things aren't right...<br/><br/>This is a wonderfully delicious horror movie, a pleasure to watch. Just don't watch it when you're pregnant...because who knows what you'll be giving birth to?"

Note the times when Guy Woodhouse comes and goes. Notice how Guy and and Roman go off and have their little chat (that we never see) while the focus is on Rosemary and Minnie, and how Guy's attitude changes after that.  Notice the way Roman stares at Hutch so much so that he ignores Rosemary when Hutch asks about the authenticity of ""Tanis Root"" .<br/><br/>
Of course, there's much more than these, and the subsequent viewings are such fun because you can spot all these things that passed you by intially."

","The first horror film that dealt directly with Satan instead of some conjured up manifestation was Roman Polanski's atmospheric and highly disturbing ""Rosemary's Baby"". A film that definitely paved the way for other great horror films of the next 20 years or so (most notably the superior ""The Exorcist"" and the equal ""The Omen""). A young couple (Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes) has moved to an apartment in New York City. Everything seems fine, but the elderly next-door neighbors (played by Oscar-winning scene-stealer Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) seem a bit strange. Soon more elderly people start hanging around and after a very odd dream Farrow becomes pregnant. It seems that Cassavetes is the father of course, but the audience knows much better. The most unholy one of all has come up from the fires of Hell and impregnated Farrow in reality. Now the tension builds as Farrow is guarded by her husband and elderly friends as they all try to keep the real truth from her. Polanski's tone is the real thing that keeps ""Rosemary's Baby"" highly entertaining and very difficult to sit through at the same time. The finale is a bit of a let-down to some (including myself to an extent), but overall the film does enough good things to become a cinematic horror classic. 4 stars out of 5."

","Slowly percolating tension in the first two thirds of the film gives way to nightmarishly terrifying last third in this Roman Polanski's highly effective horror film.

Mia Farrow is perfect in the role as Rosemary, innocent, vulnerable and uncommonly fragile. Ruth Gordon is fantastic as the garrulous and nosy old neighbor with an annoying habit of inviting herself unannounced and uninvited to her new neighbors. <br/><br/>There are some interesting dream (or are they?) sequences in the film that are surreal and highly symbolic.

","Ordinarily, this would be a fairly spooky film to begin with.  But ever since one night in early December 1980, and thanks to a man we all ""know and love"" named Mark David Chapman, this film will be even scarier, especially for a young man named Sean Lennon and his mother Yoko Ono.  Unless I am mistaken, at the very beginning of the movie, in the scene where the apartment manager is showing Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes around, we get to see the very spot where, about 12 years later, John Lennon would be savagely gunned down.  Sean Lennon was deprived of his father, and Yoko Ono was deprived of her husband. So we can now all thank Mr. Chapman for making this movie even scarier for us.  Thank you, Mr. Chapman, and as Mr. Lennon asked in one of his finest songs: ""How do you sleep at night?"""
"ken_vandenbussche","Null","0","1","10 February 2002"," Polanski's colorful classic
","Normally, I'm not very keen on diabolical films, but ""Rosemary's baby"" is a good film and possibly even a classic in its genre. Talking about genres, I think this is not really a horror movie as there's simply no gore to be found whatsoever. Roman Polanski made a fine thriller in which a young woman experiences the great but somewhat mysterious hospitality of her neighbours. At first she accepts everything what has been offered to her. But after a while (and certain suspicious happenings later) she starts to reconsider.<br/><br/>
The storyline of ""Rosemary's baby"" isn't bad, but there are other and far more impressive things about this film. For example: the way how Polanski builds up the tension by adding some very nice twists to the story now and then. Not to mention the great camera work as well as the use of different colors to create a certain atmosphere in the film. Much of the film is shot in close-up. This is another typical Polanski characteristic. By doing so, he points out the expressions on the faces of the different characters in this film. This is done in a truly magnificent but nevertheless dramatic way.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the Polish director is the way in which he represents a dream or a hallucination by the use of amateurish images.  This is all brilliantly mixed with a dreadful silence that lasts through the whole sequence. These are often the most realistic scenes in the whole film as no steady-camera was used for such shooting. Polanski's directing is one of the main reasons why this film was so successful. He's really made a difference here.<br/><br/>What about the acting then? John Cassavetes is all right and Ruth Gordon as the nosy and annoying neighbour is even better. But the star of this film is, beyond any doubt, Mia Farrow. Her acting is so life-like that I felt sorry for her at times; even when I knew that she was only playing a character in a film.<br/><br/>Tragically enough, Polanski's wife was brutally murdered by Charles Manson and his cult members.  This horrible incident happened right after this film had been released.  I guess some people shouldn't watch films at all."

","there's something about ""rosemary's baby"" that makes it hard to articulate and yet elevates it to the level of one of the best horror movies ever made, if a little slow paced and at times monotonous. as with all polanski films, the movie has a weird flavor to it and at times makes the viewer really feel uncomfortable. the plot is relatively simple:a young couple, rosemary and guy, move into an apartment complex with very friendly and, uh...unique, neighbors. the first time rosemary gets the sense that's something is not quite right is after a neighbor's seemingly motiveless suicide, and her husband's odd rage when she mentions that she wants another doctor to replace the one he chose, a strange dude who gives 'natural' prescriptions for rosemary's occasional physical pains stemming from her pregnancy. one of the most terrifying scenes is a 'dream' sequence that may or may not be a dream, although it is very likely that it isn't, in which rosemary is undressed and surrounded by her buck naked neighbors on an altar to satan while they chant and hover over her. she is also very disturbed when her husband decides that since they had planned to make love on a certain night and she fell asleep prematurely, he'll go ahead and do it anyway. the ending is the most horrifying and fearful part in the film, even surpassing the dream scene, and rosemary finally learns what her husband and her neighbors have known all along, although i won't ruin it for you. let's just say that her husband's self interest and long standing ambition to be a famous actor motivates him to make a less than savory deal with someone you probably shouldn't bargain with, whatever the reason. this is an absolute must own for serious students of film and casual fans of the horror genre. surreal, stylish, and geniunely disturbing, ""rosemary's baby"" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made."

ROSEMARY'S BABY maintains a growing paranoid creepiness that builds to a horrifying climax, with no tongue-in-cheek hipness, MTV soundtrack, or digital effects.

One of the ones with Scrappy in it.  AND the Harlem Globetrotters. The ""God is dead! Hail Satan!"" alone moves it from any semblance of horror to Adam-West-IS-Batman camp.  I felt no sympathy at all for Mia Farrow's character, partially because she was a whinging moron for the bulk of the movie, partially because Guy was right about her haircut.  The elderly couple were supposed to be sinister ringleaders hiding behind a veneer of annoying; they were such corny hacks that they never moved past the annoying bit.

"Don-102","10","0","1","19 February 1999"," Acclaimed, yet underrated urban horror...
","If there is one talent Roman Polanski has, it is creating confusion on-screen.  ""Chinatown"" is littered with moments where you're not at all sure what is what or who is who.  ""Rosemary's Baby"", his first major American work, is a masterpiece of gothic horror primarily because of the confusion the lead character faces throughout.  Are her neighbors witches?  Could her doctor be evil?  Is her husband a part of it? Even though we pretty much know these answers ourselves, the web of intrigue created by Polanski, and Farrow's convincing performance, makes everything that happens seem all the more creepy.<br/><br/>Based on Ira Levin's bestseller, the film no doubt exceeds the novel.  There are no ghosts, poltergeists, or possessions.  Just the overwhelming presence of evil in the Dakota apartments where Farrow, with her husband played by John Cassavettes,  live in what should be a safe-haven.  Farrow has nowhere or no one to go to in the biggest of cities.<br/><br/>The rape scene is one of the most spellbindingly scary scenes ever done.  We never do see the creature in full view or on top of Farrow, we only see the eyes.  They say it all.  Most horror films would use a quick long shot for a scene like this.  The sequence is very much like a nightmare Farrow believes she only had.  The scenes shot in the huge entrance to the Dakotas are accidently eerie because we know this is the exact spot where John Lennon would be murdered within 12 years.<br/><br/>One final note:  According to Roger Ebert, the voice of the blinded actor on the phone with Mia is that of Tony Curtis."

","Of course it looks bad at the outset: young Rosemary is unwittingly impregnated by the Prince of Darkness. In the end, is it really so different than the ""immaculate conception"" story associated with Jesus? Sure, he probably had better spin doctors, so of course his tale sounds a little more wholesome. What this film seems to say is that Satanism is just another choice of belief. For worshipping Satan, the cultists do very little that is egregious. Their sneaky behavior looks bad because they had to be sneaky, since such momentous events as the birth of Satan's son is apt to be misconstrued by polite society. What I'm saying is that the reason this film is so creepy is that the characters are all so ""normal"" (if a bit eccentric). Revealing to mainstream America the concept that even Satan worshippers are not so different from the culture at large is perhaps more disturbing than a film like ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" because there is no safe distance for the audience from the material."

This indisputable classic from the ingenious Roman Polanski is a vital lesson to be learned, and the direction Hollywood needs to go in if they are to save a dying genre.<br/><br/>This is one of the best Horror films ever made. PERIOD. It's flawlessly scripted and directed by Polanski, with dead-on performances by the entire cast, not just Ruth Gordon (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for this).<br/><br/>There is no need for gore and blood here; the terrifying story is told with reliance on the conspiracy that develops in the magnificent Dakota apartment building in New York City. The seemingly ""normal, average people"" living across the hall from the innocent Rosemary are actually cult leaders, and very undetectable given their advanced ages and grandparent-like qualities.<br/><br/>John Cassavetes is perfectly smug as Rosemary's husband - a struggling actor desperate for success who throws all loyalty and decency out the window by allowing himself to become tainted by his neighbor's sinister influence.<br/><br/>There is an aura of evil that permeates throughout ROSEMARY'S BABY. We identify with Mia Farrow's unsuspecting character as she gradually becomes the only sane person amidst a den of hungry satanic lions.<br/><br/>I'd like to praise Ralph Bellamy here as well. A mainstay of the great old Universal Horror Classics, he is outstanding here as the pricey and reputable doctor with a decidedly morbid idea of leisuretime activity.<br/><br/>A perfect film, from opening credits to closing credits. If you're one of the growing many who only want exploding heads with rock or rap music in your horror movies, you're better off watching c**p like FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.

When you first see them walking up the street with their tacky, colorful get-up you never stop grinning. Of course, all the old people are devilishly odd and creepy. You can never trust someone who smiles for 24 hours. ""Witches. All of them!""<br/><br/> Roman Polanski is a great director and his genius use of narrative really fuels the film. It opens up like a Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedy, and it all corrodes from there. ""Are you trying to make me be his mother?"" ""Aren't you his mother, Rosemary?""<br/><br/>CAUTION: No first-time expecting mothers should watch this movie until the baby is born. And when that does happen... check its eyes!!!"
"Ozzy1977","Null","0","1","16 September 2000"," Terror and irony
","This film is quite scary even today.  It's the mysteriousness and the fact that everything seems normal on the surface that makes this movie so riveting.  It's more of a psychological movie than a run of the mill horror film.  If you want to see a real horror classic, I recommend it. Ironically added to all that was the murder of Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate by Charles Manson followers, which in ways mirrored the film itself."
"ronmuerto","10","0","1","16 July 2000"," Film perfection in every sense...
","I just saw this movie yesterday, and it would easily rank high on my top ten films of all time.  Every line of dialog, perfect.  Every note of the soundtrack, perfect.  Every move of the camera, perfect.  Every scene, no, every frame, perfection.  This is *the* horror film masterpeice by which all other films of suspense should be measured.  Just thinking of the opening and closing lullaby gives me chills.  Must be seen as soon as possible. GO! NOW! RENT!"
"bigpappa1--2","Null","0","1","16 May 2000"," Classic chiller
","Adapted from the book by Ira Levin, this film is so scary and suspenseful that it becomes nearly unbearable to watch. Production values are extremely high; the direction is just about as good as it gets and the performances are brillant. A very well done horror film which deserved to win more than one Academy Award. The best film in the horror genre. 10 out of 10."

","When I first saw this film it scared the hell out of me! I ain't kidding. Especially when Mia Farrow was being raped by that animal-like creature(Devil)!! But eventually I bought it at my local video store and I wasn't scared ever since. Anyway, I liked this film because it gives you the chills and it isn't as violent and overdone like the Exorcist was. I don't understand Mia Farrow's voice in this picture it so mousy and sounds like an English accent. There is an inside joke when Mia is in the basement doing the laundry when she says to Angela Dorian that she looks like Victoria Vetri, when it is Victoria Vetri! Angela Dorian is Victoria Vetri's psuedonym and Playboy Playmate Name!!!!! I will always watch this at midnight in the dark living room and fall asleep. I agree with most people, that this is better than today's Horror films. I highly recommend this film for a true horror fan. Watch it alone though.<br/><br/><br/><br/>10/10"

","I don't think I've ever seen a more unsettling film.  From start to startling finish, Roman Polanski's dark classic gives you that ill feeling in the pit of your stomach.  Everything's off-kilter about the apartment building which unsuspecting Rosemary and her husband Guy rent, from the red wall-lights to the large chest a dying woman somehow managed to move all-by herself in front of a closet which contained only a vacuum cleaner and some sheets. There are so many elements to this film that Roman Polanski uses in presenting the eerie tale that whole books can be (and have been) written about it. One of the most appalling things is Polanski's realistic understanding of motherhood that produces the shocking final turn in Rosemary's trial.  A very unpleasant film to watch, but undeniably great, completely redefining the horror genre and starting horror's reign in the box offices lasting up until the 80's."
"Freak-69","10","0","1","5 December 1999"," Satanic!!
","I just finished reading Ira Levin's novel and I think it's really groovy. I'd say as good as the film, maybe even a bit better. In the movie I love Ruth Gordon as Minnie. She is THE actress of the 60's. But also Mia Farrow as Rosemary is a reason to love that film! Sometimes you're asking yourself how somebody can be so pretty but then, in the middle of the film, she scares you - so skinny! But I love that film! 9/10!"
"MovieFan983","9","0","1","7 January 1999"," Excellent!
","The only thing wrong with this movie is that it ended, and the ending, even though it was her baby, I wouldny have kept that demon child! Anyway it was a very good movie, with lots of scary parts, and I bet the audience who went and saw this movie was surprised with the nudity and sorts. I give this gem of a movie a 9 out of 10. Rated R for violence, some sexuality, and nudity."
"KMR","10","0","1","17 November 1999"," A true classic
","This is my favorite horror movie--actually one of my favorite movies, period. It features fantastic direction and performances (special kudos to John Cassavettes, who never gets proper recognition for just how good he was here), a wonderfully 60's-sounding music score that goes from frothy to sinister in mere seconds, and of course there's the intricately brilliant story, faithfully adapted from Ira Levin's 1967 novel. It is one of those movies that effortlessly absorbed and channeled back the tenor of the times in which it was made -- for example, the storyline clearly expands upon the youth movement's late 60's rallying cry of ""Never trust anyone over 30,"" and in one pivotal scene there is a glimpse of the ""Is God Dead?"" tempest that was a genuine thing, albeit briefly, in the violent, dark reality that was the USA in 1968. Enormously influential, Rosemary's Baby is an acknowledged classic, and a paranoid delight from start to finish. It gets a 10 out of 10, no question."
"Beefy-2","Null","0","1","31 October 1999"," Astonishing!
","This movie is absolutely breathtaking.  Mia Farrow is so easy to identify with.  There were times when I wanted to scream at the characters on the screen.  That is how well-acted this movie is.  Some parts may seem a little campy by today's audiences but for me there was not an unreal moment. Ruth Gordon definitely deserved that Oscar, as did Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes. I absolutely loved that Scrabble scene.  I found myself thinking 'Come on, Rosemary! Figure it out!' This is my favorite horror movie."
"Ilsy","Null","0","1","27 September 1999"," Frightening!
","I read the book for the first time when I was fifteen. And then I waited about ten years until the film was shown on TV so I could see it at last. And it's great! One of the few movies that is as good as the book! You're always wondering, if she's right when she's worrying about her husband, her neighbours and her doctor or if she's just stressed because of her pregnancy. The actors are very good although I think that Rosemary's husband should seem more harmless than Cassavetes is (he's always a little bit too demonic).<br/><br/>And the end of the film is better than the book: you never see the child, you only see how Farrow nearly loses her mind when she sees the baby for the first time. In the book the child looks like a devil en miniature: red hair, long fingernails and little horns. I always wondered how such a goat-looking-baby should be raised up without the whole world watching it! Polanski made it better than the author.<br/><br/>AND ONE LAST WARNING: Never read the Levin-Sequel ""Rosemary's Son""! It's the worst sequel with the most idiotic end I've ever read!"
"seed-2","Null","0","1","26 September 1999"," true fear
","the film is indeed a masterpiece, but you must agree that the true basis for the fear created by the film.....is the deception carried out/ and lived through of GUY, Mr. Woodhouse  only by watching the film over again, (and knowing the outcome) can we really begin to understand the lengths he is willing to  go to. to achieve his success , and of course fulfill his obligation to Roman & Minnie Castevet.     real life  folklore of the film, and it's location only add to the thrill"

","This movie is still unique and incredible.  Mia Farrow should have received an Oscar nomination for her fine performance as a woman who endures not only Satan, but Ruth Gordon as a next-door neighbor!  I don't know which prospect is scarier.  This movie is a landmark in the horror genre, and hold ups extremely well."

","One of the best horror films I´ve ever saw. It maybe not scary, but that doesn´t mean nothing. I don´t get scared often. So I really recommend "" Rosemary´s Baby"" is a brilliant movie, with a surprising ending"
"Fortune-2","Null","0","1","30 June 1999"," truly, truly creepy
","This movie truly frightened me.  What was so interesting about it, though, was that the true horror of the movie (disregarding the ending, which I simply could not watch the first time) is totally understated, yet there the whole time.  The horror comes with the audience knowing what's happening, what really is going on with the neighbors and with Rosemary's demise, and not being able to do a thing about it.  In its own way, this movie is incredibly tense and nerve-racking.  It's the ultimate last word in ""I have a bad feeling about this"" movies.  Roman Polanski is great at creating that underlying horror -- I can't even THINK about the opening and closing music without a shiver.  The music in general was effective, and the direction, especially the ""dream"" sequence, was dark and very Polanski-esque.  The acting was good, understated, exactly what the movie called for.  So much scarier than any of the teen ""horror"" movies out lately."
"yenlo","9","0","1","20 May 1999"," Gothic Gold
","This is Gothic Horror at it's best. The fact that as a viewer you never see any thing actually horrifying is what makes this such a scary film. Mia Farrow puts forth her best performance by far. Then there is of course Ruth Gordon who delivers one of the greatest performances ever by an actress on the big screen.  From her first scene right up to her last (check out how she uses  her finger to try and remove the knife mark from the floor). Rosemary has no allies on her side except the viewer and there is nothing we can do to help her.  Roman Polanski's greatest achievement."
"Movieman-133","10","0","1","16 May 1999"," A unique horror classic.
","This film was boring at times but the ending was so dramatic and interesting that it can never be forgotten.  The movie is filled with confusing yet eerie scenes and I would suggest the book before diving into this film.  However,  the second time I watched it,  I could understand the parallels and the curses that were placed and I fully understood what John Cassevetes did for his successful career. The last 30 minutes of the movie was exciting and suspenseful and it is something so unique that it can never be duplicated--sorry Hush.   The performance of Mia Farrow was marvelous.. She was beautiful,  innocent,  dramatic,  and it was someone that the viewers could really sympathize and excite for.  The motherly song sing by Mia herself seemed so bizarre--the innocent lullaby was turned into such a question and the fact that they placed that motherly song in between all the witches and pills was so bizarrre.  I would agree that Ruth Gordan certainly played up her part over the top but I liked Mia so much she seemed somewhat of a distraction.  Kind of like a cranky neighbor from The Simpsons that you just want to go away--you're too cookey and you bother me. This movie really presented the question of what will happen now but to make a sequel could certainly not be as good as this.  God is Dead,   All of Them Witches, curses, Satan,   and a world full of drugs and cultist and motherly scheming make this one of the most interesting horror films ever created."

","Believe me, after watching ""Rosemary Baby"" there won't be any more ghosts or vampires in your most horrible nightmares, there will just be satan! Mia Farrow's acting is really good but Ruth Gordon's performance is so strange and weird that you will never forget her! Well done, Roman!"
"Indieboy","Null","0","1","11 March 1999"," This film is eternal
","I have read the novel and seen this film at least 8 times, yet it still has the power to unnerve me the way few films can.  Most people my age who would look at this film would throw it off as a ""cheap"" attempt at a horror film because of the lack of gore and violence, but I think it is the restraint in its execution that makes it so effective.  So to all you young people out there...see this movie NOW!! I won't reveal anything at all about this film..I think it far better to know nothing at all about it and just jump in.  I will say however that Mia Farrow is amazing in her feature film debut here."

","This movie is so weird. It's like Mary Farrow is this tall waife, and she is programmed to have Satan's Baby, and she doesnt even know it. I didnt understand very much of it. They all speak real weird and not much happens. It's from the 1940s so I suppose they didnt make good cinama back then. It was a good premmise I suppose. But I didnt understand a lot of it. I mean it's  supposed to be a scary movie but there's not even and blood! This is pretty taim by today's standards. Mainly i just didnt really understand it. I bet if Stephen Speelburg would remake it, it would be better!"
