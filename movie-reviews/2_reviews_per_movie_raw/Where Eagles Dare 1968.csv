"axeman-9","9","129","154","3 September 2004"," The ultimate 'men on a mission' movie
","Once a year, usually around Christmas time but always in winter, this movie is played somewhere on British TV.  Like 'The Great Escape' this movie has become a staple of TV station classic war movies wheeled out once a year to keep the punters happy, and it always delivers.<br/><br/>How can it fail?  It has spectacular scenery, great actors, lots of schoolboy WWII style action and even busty wenches in maid uniforms.  This film is ingrained in the psyche, you cannot see a mountaintop castle without thinking of Schloss Adler and the cable-car scenes.  If I'm trudging through the snow in the woods then I hear myself humming the theme from 'Where Eagles Dare'.  If I or anyone from my generation picks up a radio, it's only a matter of time before someone starts sending ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy"" in an imitation of Richard Burton's plummy tones.  It's a given.<br/><br/>I know it's not the most realistic movie ever made, but Richard Burton, Michael Horden, Clint Eastwood and the gang carry it off with great aplomb and we believe every line.  The pacing is excellent, leaving similar offerings such as 'Guns of Navarone' feeling like funeral marches.  And talk about atmosphere!  This movie reeks atmosphere, from the settings in the beautiful mountains to the scenes inside the old caste hallways to the exterior shots of people rapelling down the sides of the viciously cold walls.  It's a must see, 8 out of 10 compared to all films, and 10 out of 10 for 'men on a mission' movies."
"John_Mclaren","10","103","128","22 April 2003"," Terrific Stuff!
","Epic war pic where Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood manage to unmask most of the German spy network in England, slip Jerry the wrong plans for the second front, kill the leading members of the Abwehr in Southern Bavaria, and destroy half of the local Wehrmacht- all in a little over two hours. Terrific score by Ron Goodwin, great action sequences and a commanding performance by Burton give this the ""must see"" imprimateur.  Meanwhile it's obvious why the Nazis lost the war- since they rate one worse than Imperial Stormtroopers in the ""can't hit the broadside of a barn"" shooting stakes. Our plucky Allied troops more or less shoot themselves out of anywhere and anything....<br/><br/>However the radio call-sign ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy"" is now part of British folklore; the cable-car sequence is unmatched in spectacle; and the whole film makes you cheer up and feel better about the world.  For once the Brits are portrayed as cooly proficient rather than public school chumps. What with the Yanks playing second fiddle, it's almost like the good old days ...."
"silverscreen888","8","37","43","14 June 2005"," Most Exciting, Atmospheric, Ingenious--McLean Served Well This Time
","""Where Eagles Dare"" was produced by folks who decided that Alistair Macleam deserved to be produced on film by someone who followed the author's exciting ideas. The result is a major improvement of the Us-er qualities of the character played by Clint Eastwood, the potent casting of Richard Burton, who is very very good (for once) in an adventure-level lead as the infinitely-resourceful leader of a WWII team of destructive agents, and an intelligent if action-level work of cinematic artistry. Others have written very well on this film; what I want to add to their basic core of arguments is some notes about the acting and ideas. From the group's boss, Michael Hordern to the ladies, Mary Ure and zoftik Ingrid Pitt, to enigmatic Robert Beatty, everyone involved is more than adequate in his/her part to very good. The three enemies, Ferdy Mayne, Derrin Nesbitt and Anton Diffring excel in whatever scenes they are given; and Peter Barkworth, Donald Houston, Patrick Wymark, et al as traitors have never been seen to greater advantage. Director Brian Hutton faced the all-but-impossible task of bringing a vaguely-implausible raid staged in snow country on an isolated castle to life. With stirring music, lovely art direction and edge-of-impossible special effects involving explosives, running machine-gun duels in a bus, falling telephone poles, a battle on a cable car, wrecking at an airport and a parachute drop betrayed from the start, he manages to bring the entire tale off very nicely by my standards. The other chief asset of the film lies in its unusually intelligent dialogue, plot turns and constant surprise. I counted at least seven major surprises, every one of which as in a good Hitchcockian thriller leads to a memorable scene; these are therefore not just script gimmicks, but rather they qualify as ingenious use of the adventure genre to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. This film perhaps is what James Bond films always should have been, but only in the case of ""Doctor No"" and ""Goldfinger"" ever were. One could wish that ""The Secret Ways"", ""Ice Station Zebra"" and several others of McLean's thrillers had been treated with as much respect, and near genius, as this memorable piece of screen excitement was (for once) afforded."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","58","73","18 August 2005"," Fantastic stuff!
","This is one of the first real action movies as we know it today, ever made. The movie has lots of explosions and gun- and fist fights. The story is told in a fast pace with lots of cuts, even though the movie itself isn't short at all (158 minutes.).<br/><br/>Even though it is still a war movie, this movie isn't as heavy and or serious as many other WW II movies made in the same period. It is kind of in the same style as ""The Guns of Navarone"" (Also written by Alistair MacLean.). It's more is adventurous and fun to watch than heavy or realistic. Director Brian G. Hutton later also made the other 'fun'/adventurous/WW II movie ""Kelly's Heroes"".<br/><br/>Another element that distinct this movie from other movies from the same genre is the story. The story by famous writer Alistair MacLean is just brilliant! It begins as an average WW II rescue-mission movie but as the movie progresses the story takes several twists, until at a certain point you don't even know who to thrust anymore. The ending is really action-movie-like spectacular and features a tense fight an a moving cable-car followed by the perhaps even better car chase, which really reminded of the chase were Indy and his father are escaping the Nazi's on the motorcycle, in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" Even the music sounded kind of similar! I wouldn't be surprised if Spielberg and Williams were inspired by this movie. The same goes for many other movie directors and other persons in the movie business by the way. I see similarities between this movie with 'modern' work quite often, both in story and characters as well as the action, editing and many other elements from this movie. This really is an inspirational movie, that as an action movie, just like as for instance ""North by Northwest"", was far ahead of its time.<br/><br/>It was a bit strange to see Clint Eastwood in the sidekick role. The main character of the movie is played by the legendary Richard Burton. Both actors really push this movie to an higher level with their profession and expertise and both are very believable in their roles.<br/><br/>An entertaining, action packed adventurous war movie with a splendid story and two wonderful performances from the two main actors.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"jcu1963","Null","106","139","11 November 2004"," Terrific Action Movie
","I couldn't help notice one of the postings about this movie, calling it a snoozer. I hardly agree with that assessment. In fact, I would categorize the film as one of the best action films ever made, whether WWII or other. If the action isn't enough to hold one's attention, the movie has a number of twists and turns to hold your attention until the perhaps not-so-obvious ending. <br/><br/>Some postings have also been critical of the length of the movie, somewhat more than 2+ hours. Again, everything about the film keeps it moving very well.<br/><br/>Most of the postings rate this film on a 1-10 basis. I give it a 10 for sure."

","""Where Eagles Dare"" was one of the first films that my father took me to see at the cinema when I was a boy in the 1970's. Back then I was 100% caught up with the on-screen action and loved every minute of it. Now 25+ years later the film holds the exact same thrills for me as it did then. I always list it as one of my 10 all-time favourite films.<br/><br/>I had no idea who Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood were at the time I first saw ""WED"" but I thought they were marvellous in the film. A few years later the BBC started showing it on TV (usually at Christmas!) and I always watched it each time it was on. Some years ago I was able to buy the Widescreen video of ""WED"" and now I can watch it whenever I like!<br/><br/>The music is absolutely brilliant and I often find myself humming the stirring main theme from time to time.<br/><br/>Not only did ""WED"" introduce me to Burton and Eastwood (two of my all-time favourite actors) but also to the novels of Alistair MacLean and many of his other films, such as ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""Bear Island"" and ""Breakheart Pass"" (all of which I recommend)."

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","85","112","10 January 2006"," The fortress - impenetrable. The army guarding it - invincible. Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton - UNSTOPPABLE!
","A team of elite covert agents working for the British Government is sent to infiltrate a huge Nazi fortress. Their mission: evacuate an Allied General who has detailed knowledge of the Normandy invasion. Parachuting down into the Alps the team soon discovers that one of them is dead and that there is a Nazi traitor in their midst. And that is not all what's going on...<br/><br/>From opening scene to final scene Alistair MacLean's screenplay is a masterpiece of the action genre with a detailed and involving plot that unfolds in a very interesting manner. There are plenty of hairpin turns along the way that build up the suspense to a truly explosive TNT packed climax. That is all thanks to Brian Hutton's direction, which is, well, a blueprint for contemporary studio-budget action film-making. The film is long, but the real-time development of many scenes makes for terrific suspense even in slow moments and utterly breakneck action scenes. The best example is the final 45 minutes - an escape scene in real-time as our heroes breakout of the Schloss Adler. Consisting of shootouts, fights, chases, explosions, and car crashing it is probably one of the best action sequences ever made. For reasons beyond me Brian Hutton's career never fully took off into action adventure film-making, but had it, he would be the Hitchcock of action film-making. This film does to shootouts what Hitchcock did for showers! Well, almost.<br/><br/>Next are the stars - Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton. They are the leaders of the covert operation and they are a terrific, fearless, sub-machine gun totting duo who give the Nazis what they deserve most - pure hell. The classic corridor shootout as Eastwood fends of soldiers from the castle radio room is brilliant and ridiculous at the same time - he takes 'em all out! With a submachine gun in each hand! Make no mistake, this movie is ridiculous and wholly improbable, but if you find an action film that is more entertaining, involving, and suspenseful, along with being pure fun to watch, I'll be damned.<br/><br/>If that's the cake, then the icing must be Ron Goodwin's amazing score of epic proportions. First appearing in the opening credits (or the DVD main menu) it is the type of stuff that makes contemporary master film composer Hans Zimmer proud.<br/><br/>Action film fans, this is one of the ultimate movies for you. Take note - Watch it! 10/10<br/><br/>Rated PG, quite generously, for pretty extensive violence and action"

","Okay, what can I say?<br/><br/>I've read all the comments (yes, every single one of them), and it seems like tons of people don't like implausible movies. That's fine, but the next time James bond defuses a nuclear bomb at 007 seconds left till detonation, I expect you to stand up and walk out of the movie too.<br/><br/>For those of us who *like* our men to be super, awesome, and face danger with a wry smile and a catchy line: this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Okay, first off, Burton is to die for. Don't get me wrong: I love Clint as much as the next girl, but Burton is so...masterful. He's deliciously awesome. And sometimes, when he's wiping out tons of Nazis, you can see this gleeful evil and satisfying smile on his face that just tells you: this guy *love* his job. If he isn't killing Nazis, he just wouldn't know what to do with himself. That's my kinda man.<br/><br/>Okay, so you have to totally suspend some belief for this movie to work, but it's a James Bond like thriller. I mean, people who are commenting that it doesn't conform to WWII historical standards have *got* to get their heads out of their books for a bit and try *enjoying* life instead of merely *studying* it for a while. And, by the way, as one user commented, some helicopters like the one in the movie *were* flying in 1939 in Germany. They just weren't widely used at the time.<br/><br/>This movie totally kicks butt. Forget about it making sense in a military way: that's not what it's about. War Games didn't make sense either, but it was fun anyway. And, another little gripe about some critics: the Germans aren't in a position to blow up the doors in the castle because *tada* that's a really stupid thing to do seeing as how if they miscalculate the explosive charge, they could bring a ton of medieval blocks slamming down on their heads in the process. The Nazis are stupid in this movie, but they're not *that* stupid. Duh.<br/><br/>Clint manages to wipe out about half the Reich in this movie with his machine gun, and even has a great take where he does a Matrix-style dual-wield gunning move, which is all in great fun. Hey, Han Solo wiped out about half the Stormtroopers in the galaxy too with his blaster, and trying to point that out as being unreal would be just...well...silly. The Force isn't real either. Wanna complain? Go figure....<br/><br/>I suggest you get this movie on DVD. It's awesome. The letterbox format totally kicks and I love it. The score is great. The action is awesome. The plot, the first time you see it, always keeps you guessing. At least it did for me, but that's because I don't read a billion books on spies so that I can dream about being one when I never will be. Maybe that's why I enjoyed this movie a lot more than some others. This has got to be one of my top all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>Yes! Awesome movie. Have fun watching it. It's long but it's great. Sometimes great movies are best when they are long so you get to enjoy them more. To the others who took this waaaaaaaaay too seriously: relax.<br/><br/>It's...just...a...movie. Maybe you never heard that line before."

","A highly entertaining world war II action film with two of the greatest actors of their time at a high point of their career - Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. The first hour or so is the setting to the action that will follow: a group of American and British soldiers is sent to a castle where the Natzis are holding an important American General. The plot of course is not that simple and has a lot of spins and surprises that accompanied by a fascinating action scenes (Very impressing for a 1968). With a beautiful filming location at the freezing landscapes of Germany and Austria this movie is truly an amazing to watch. Notable sequences are the cable car sequence and the final escaping sequence. Richard Burton gives his usual strong performance and Clint Eastwood is good as his executor. All in all a well crafted action classic that is highly recommended. 10/10"

","Where Eagles Dare is simply wonderful. Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are in terrific form as leaders of a mission deep behind enemy lines. Their job: to infiltrate a mountain top castle and rescue an imprisoned American colonel. There's actually more to the mission than that, but to give away the twists would be to rob anyone who hasn't seen the movie of some wonderful surprises.<br/><br/>The snowy backdrop is perfectly captured. The action sequences (of which there are many) are brilliantly staged, especially the fight atop the cable car, and the bus chase at the end. Each character is well cast, with Burton, Eastwood, Ure and Hordern giving commanding performances. Best of all is the little-known Derren Nesbitt who oozes menace and charm as a nasty Nazi soldier.<br/><br/>I've seen this film countless times and it never tires me. It has so many twists and turns and well-execute sequences that it is gripping every time you watch it. There's really no other way to say it - you need to see this film and see it soon!"

","Alistair McLean's movie adaptation is a thrill to watch.<br/><br/>Putting Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton together, was a masterpiece idea and it actually works!<br/><br/>The scenery in itself, in the Bavarian Alps, adds a touch of uneasiness about the entire story. Difficult to reach, difficult to conquer, but above all, difficult to escape from.<br/><br/>It's a cat and mouse game between British and German Intelligence services in World War Two. A later filmed adventure of this sort, but based on actual events, would add to the realistic perspectives shown in ""Where Eagles Dare"".<br/><br/>In fact, in 1976, a movie called ""The Eagle Has Landed"", inspired this time from a novel by Jack Higgins, dealt with the plan of the Third Reich to abduct and/or kill Winston Churchill!<br/><br/>If one considers that, ""Where Eagles Dare"" depicts something that could really have happened, only from the other side of the fence.<br/><br/>Everything in it is depicted in a very realistic and chilling manner and even if someone described it as James Bond in WWII, it is far less fantastic as one may come to think.<br/><br/>Granted, to perform such missions, someone ought to have been either a madman or so careless about his life, that luck would have had more importance than actual real tactics.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is an adventure movie that grips you from the very first instant and doesn't let loose to the end.<br/><br/>Far more paced than ""Guns of Navarone"", this is one of the few very good action movies ever made.<br/><br/>The music by veteran composer Ron Goodwin is memorable and unlike his other ""war"" installments so easily identifiable that you will be left humming it even when the movie is already finished.<br/><br/>It is more a cult movie, than an actual ""history-making"" one, but as i always say, they don't make them like this anymore."

"Sonatine97","7","53","83","23 August 2002"," Great Escapist Entertainment
","Perhaps one of the best war films ever to come out of Hollywood, WED, is typical Boys-Own, escapist adventure, where our heroes (Burton, Eastwood et al) can do no wrong and the action comes thick and fast.<br/><br/>But this isn't total mindless violence (see Rambo 2, for that kind of rubbish). WED does have a decent story and nice little plot twists, that although not totally plausible do make the film a bit more thought-provoking than just watching 148 minutes of gun fire, explosions, decapitations and soldiers being thrown off cable cars at great altitude.<br/><br/>Even though both Eastwood & Burton hog most of the show (and rightly so), they are ably supporting by two women (Mary Ure & Ingrid Pitt). Both women don't have chunky roles but its significant to see any females play such positive parts in what is mostly a male arena when it comes to war films.<br/><br/>Some of the photography is absolutely stunning even though some of the stunts are clearly filmed in the relative safety of a studio, and it shows too!<br/><br/>The acting, although not as po-faced, talky & self-righteous as the film's nearest rival, The Guns Of Navarone (see review), is good by most standards. Burton looks perhaps little old for this kind of all-out hero roll, but he manages to pull it off with his fierce determination and calm disposition.<br/><br/>As for Eastwood, well it meant a uniformed departure from his poncho, gun holster & cowboy hat from his day with Sergio Leone. He is still playing the same kind of character as The Man With No Name, and is still killing hundreds of bad guys while looking suitably cool & reserved, the only difference is the era - from the Wild West to WW2.<br/><br/>But surprisingly the combination of Burton's classical approach to acting & Eastwood's brash new-kid-on-the block 60s adaption works quite well and make for a good partnership as they go about kicking German Butt in their usual inimitable ways.<br/><br/>Brian Hutton's direction follows the pace & temperament of Alistair MacLean's sparkly screenplay although I do feel the film is a tad too long and I think about 15 minutes could've been cut without really upsetting the balance of the story.<br/><br/>WED doesn't challenge the brain, it is thought-provoking in its own little ways and probably bares little or no resemblance to how life was really like during the real WW2. But for all that WED is great entertainment. It doesn't insult the intelligence but then again it was never meant to. But what we are left with is a very enjoyable romp with a great cast and superb scenary.<br/><br/>It doesn't take itself too seriously as Guns Of Navarone does; and neither is it just mindless violence (Rambo 2). This film dares to be different and succeeds in spades.<br/><br/>Recommended.<br/><br/>***/*****"

Burton and Eastwood are both fun to watch here and like the two leads, the camera work is outstanding, and the direction by Brian Hutton doesn't over play his hand.

","During World War II, Major Smith is in charge of a highly dangerous mission to rescue a captured American general held in a remote mountain castle being used by the Germans as a command centre. As he and his men attempt to infiltrate this stronghold, it seems that double-agents are everywhere and the mission is doomed to fail ...<br/><br/>There are two types of war movies; the poetic philosophical ones and the ones where they blow up as much stuff as possible. This is the best example of the latter and for me the best World War II movie ever made. I think it's the unique structure that does it for me - there's an impossible mission to break into an impregnable fortress which lasts for eighty minutes, followed by a fifteen-minute dialogue scene that piles so many crazy plot twists on top of each other that it turns your brain into mush. Then there's an unparalleled fifty minutes of non-stop action as our heroes kill their enemies, destroy the communications, blow up half the castle, rappel down the walls, escape in a cable car, leap into a river, drive a truck through occupied territory, dynamite a bridge, smash up an airfield and escape in a fast-moving plane. I think this sequence is simply the finest non-stop action footage ever lensed. The great novelist Alistair MacLean wrote the story directly for the screen (although he also published it in book form) and came up with the most exciting wartime spy adventure ever written. There's just no flab in it; it's a long movie but it's all plot and action all the way, with no boring characterisation, love interest, waffly dialogue or padding. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the cast are fantastic in the low-key tone of their performances; grim, dogmatic, straight-ahead and focused, with Burton and Eastwood a brilliantly unlikely pair of leads, and kudos to the relatively unknown Nesbitt as the memorably creepy red-headed Major Von Hapen, the scariest Gestapo officer in the movies (until Ronald Lacey in Raiders Of The Lost Ark). The four key technical elements of any film - photography, music, editing and art direction - are all outstanding, particularly Ron Goodwin's big booming drummer-boy score, which pounds memorably along. This is that rare cinema treat; a brilliant story, brilliantly realised. Our appreciation must also go to the incredible stuntwork by Hollywood legend Yakima Canutt, who was the assistant director and supervised many great sequences like the hair-raising fight atop the cable-cars. Shot in fantastic Alpine locations in Austria (the Schloss Adler is really the eleventh-century Burg Hohenwerfen, south of Salzburg) and at Borehamwood Studio. Trivia - Clint Eastwood, as the charming Major Shaffer, kills about forty people up close and personal in this film, and about another forty indirectly via explosives - a Boy's Own comic-book soldier hero if ever there was. This movie is the best kind of entertainment - fast-moving, action-packed and dramatic without ever being stupid, a sensational story and superbly put together. Don't miss it."

","I love me some World War 2 films. Many of my favourites are: Inglourious Basterds, The Great Escape and so on. But this, Brian G. Hutton's ""Where Eagles Dare"" is my favourite. The film is about 7 men and a woman on a mission: get into an isolated Nazi castle, rescue an allied General, and get out. It stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood in it's leading male roles, and they both give excellent performances, as does Mary Ure, who is the leading female. This film has some of the best action and suspense scenes in any WWII film (only being bettered by Inglourious Basterds) and it throws many twists and turns at you that you don't see coming. The final half hour or so features some almightily epic explosions and is a joy to watch, as is the rest of the film.

","Critics generally compare ""Where Eagles Dare"" unfavorably to ""The Guns of Navarone.""

Although it's running time is approximately the same as ""Navarone's"", it never seems as long and you never feel the characters are trying to make a point, except with their machine pistols.  <br/><br/>Of course ""Eagles"" greatest strong points are Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood.  By 1968 Burton had eschewed the serious parts for the big money and the critics crucified him for selling out.  Well, in this case I'm glad he did since he's superb as team leader Major Smith.  Burton projects an aura of invincible self-confidence.  He's rather reserved much of the time, but you never doubt his engagement.  This is a man who simply won't be defeated.  Peck's stuffy, diffident performance in ""Navarone"" pales by comparison.  And Eastwood, though hardly Burton's equal as an actor, is Dirty Harry in boot camp - his Schaffer will kill you sooner than look at you, and it doesn't hurt that he looks great too.<br/><br/>""Eagles"" also has a better villain than anyone in ""Navarone"", superior scenery, and a far superior score.   Ron Goodwin's theme has been etched in my mind for over 30 years, but I can't remember a note from ""Navarone's.""<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest World War Two adventure film of all time.  Less realistic than a James Bond movie, but outstanding escapist entertainment."
"1981","8","6","7","18 June 2001"," An excellent, laconic adventure film.
","My highest praise is reserved for films that, with little ornamentation or pretense, accomplish their task. ""Where Eagles Dare"" does so with few one liners and special effects that are a part but not an overwhelming part of the script. In other words, there is little or no room for gratuitousness in this picture.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see Richard Burton in a role that demands little or no dialogue, especially considering this is a man who has rendered dialogue most exquisitely beautiful by the particular lilt of his voice. In this role he is frank and only speaks when necessary, therefore, seeing as how most of this film is action, he says very little. Some purists would fault Burton for taking a role that seems devoid of the usual acting challenges he appeared to enjoy attacking early in his career, but I disagree. This film is a departure from the normal Burton ""oeuvre"" and yet he does pull of the role of Major Smith convincingly. One does not expect this man to be either audacious nor flamboyant and Burton, whose very presence suggests a call for histrionics, executes this role quietly. <br/><br/>Now it is well known that Burton was not seeking a challenge by taking on this project, his primary concern was revamping his potency in the box-office by staring in a blockbuster. And he got it. But we cannot fault him for that because he possessed the facility as an actor to pull it off. Burton could be both a dramatic performer and a daring sex symbol. Besides, standing alongside a veritable ""tough-guy"" like Eastwood, Burton needed to be able to hold his end up because the movie going audience had already identified Eastwood as the quintessential tough guy. Had Burton not been up to the task, this film would not have been a success.<br/><br/>The script is entertaining and has a few notable twists in it, a testament to the skill of screenwriter and adventure novelist Alistair MacClain. Character development is not of particular importance in this story and yet one does come away with a palpable sense of Major Smith, a fact that I again acknowledge is the handywork of Burton, whose presence is auspicious regardless of his role. Overall, this film appears to be able to balance the rhythmic quietude of action while interjecting enough personal flair to make the film memorable and not another futile exercise in on-screen action and viewer instant gratification/escapism. This movie is one of the best in its genre and is worth a good viewing."

","Take Alistair MaClean's ""Guns of Navarone"" and ""Ice Station Zebra"" then you have the recipe for ""Where Eagles Dare."" Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton are sent on an Alpine spy/sabotage mission behind enemy lines aimed at confusing and delaying the Germans. It's interesting to see Eastwood take seconds to Burton's acting in this picture. Eastwood was just coming off his major success with the Italian westerns and was an international star, but wasn't an American leading man. This film marks the last time he wasn't in the star/leading man part. Dotted throughout the movie are wonderful actors who turn in solid performances. Accomplished thespians Patrick Wymark, Donald Houston and Derrin Nesbitt, to name a few, are faces many will recognize from UK television roles. An interesting point made in the film is the ordinary German soldier's sometime disdain for the fanatic Nazi SS or Gestapo trooper. This is shown through one German officer's unwillingness to comply with the local Gestapo major. It's rare to see that kind of ""layer"" added to the German side of a plot in an American picture. Generally, they are always just treated as bad guys to be dispatched in hails of lead or burning explosions. The film holds up well over time, and there's little to date it to 1969, save for the youthful faces of many of the actors. Some 36 years after its release, ""Where Eagles Dare"" continues to be entertaining. It certainly beats the current crop of ""big gasoline driven explosion"" movies that have no plot. It is heavy on action and plot, but it has a running time of 155 minutes -- plenty of time to develop plot and action."

Its like a guessing game which the director plays with the audience.<br/><br/> Richard Burton charts out of his usual epic and sensitive roles and dons on the mantle of a tough Major.

From the thrilling drum beats of the title sequence music over the spectacular backdrop of the Alps the viewer is captured. My parents took me to see this in in 1968 when I was six and I thought it was the best thing I had ever seen (My mother was probably yawning.). At that age it probably was. In later life of course one is a more critical viewer and there are several glaring flaws. Why do none of the Germans ever speak German is only the most obvious. What are all these German soldiers doing in Bavaria, when the war was being fought everywhere else is another. Also in the whole course of the protracted escape sequence, while the five goodies mow down German troops like fresh hay, the Germans all appear to be firing blanks as none of the heroes gets so much as a scratch. I've seen the film so many times now I know the dialogue word for word so it's impossible to be moved now but I will always recall the first time I saw it. All those explosions! The tension of the gradual entry to the castle by Eastwood and Burton and the thrill of the chase afterwards! Thanks dad. You gave a boy the thrill of his young life."

","Director Brian Hutton was responsible for two classic action movies, ""Where Eagles Dare"", released in 1968, and ""Kelly's Heroes"", released in 1970. Both were old fashioned adventure movies, both were set in WW2, both filtered a past conflict through a Vietnam Era prism and both were packed to the brim with wild chases, humour, tension and lots of beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>""Kelly's Heroes"" was originally intended as an anti-war satire, but was severely reedited by studios until it resembled a more straightforward action movie. Made the same year as ""MASH"" (which also featured Donald Sutherland as a hippie), Eastwood and Hutton envisioned the film as an anarchic satire, Vietnam era anti establishment spread thickly across the more prim and proper battlefields of World War 2.<br/><br/>""Heroes'"" final cut retains some of this irreverence, but most of its playful cynicism now resides solely in Oddball (played by Donald Sutherland), a tank driving hippie who spouts such lines as ""Why don't you knock it off with them negative waves, baby?"" and ""Why don't you say something righteous and hopeful for a change?"". He's a fun character (and a nice contrast to Eastwood's stoic persona), who helps imbue Hutton's film with some ""flower power"" playfulness. <br/><br/>Yet despite its goofy plot (our heroes fight their way across France in an attempt to rob a German bank) and marijuana fuelled soundtrack, Hutton also bathes his film in lots of detail. A siege on a town plays out like the end of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and several skirmishes are filled with tension. ""Kelly's Heroes"" may be a counterculture comedy, but it nevertheless works tremendously well as a conventional war movie.<br/><br/>Arguably better than ""Kelly's Heroes"" - though perhaps less interesting - is ""Where Eagles Dare"", an epic adventure movie based on an Alistair Mclean's novel. Filmed in Austria, the film looks great, filled with snow capped mountains, perilous cable carts, a cool German castle and even a babe called Heidi. Hutton's direction would prove hugely influential, many of his scenes lifted by Tarantino and George Lucas, and several of his sequences re-staged as levels in modern video games.<br/><br/>Of course the film will seem a bit dated to modern audiences weened on fast edits, taunt action and CGI. Hutton's rear projection work in particular now stands out like a sore thumb. But Clint Eastwood is always cool, and those who like casual violence will find several scenes in which Clint mows down stairwells full of Germans to be shockingly laid back. Clint isn't just unphased when dishing out violence, he's positively relaxed.<br/><br/>The 1960s and early 1970s saw a number of ""boys own"" adventure movies being released (""Dirty Dozen"", ""Guns of Navarone"", ""The Great Escape"" etc). Films like these used war, not to express any moral or patriotic sentiment, but as vehicles for action, aimed primarily at the young 'modern' audiences of the Vietnam era. These films may have done nothing but dished out casual violence and reduced WW2 to a series of heroic adventures, (Huston did this stuff right with ""The Man Who Would Be King""), but nevertheless surpassed the next wave (Indiana Jones, Star Wars etc) of similar flicks because they, arguably, retained a certain adult sensibility. A sensibility that would be completely eroded come the 1980s.<br/><br/>8/10 - See Pontecorvo's ""Burn!""."

It's hard to beat. I have seen this movie about twenty times and I still lose count on how many Nazi's Clint Eastwood, as LT. Shaffer, blows away. Now I know how Dirty Harry learned to shoot. Richard Burton, as the stoic Major Smith, makes the most of his role as leader and master manipulator. Together they make a great team. Supporting roles should be noted with Anton Driffing as a Third Reich officer. You may remember him in ""Circus of Horrors"" playing the lead. Also Derrren Nesbitt, as Von Hapen, recreates himself almost entirely in his role with Frank Sinatra in ""The Naked Runner"" as Hartman. Only this time he's a good guy.

","This was really a vehicle for Messrs Eastwood and Burton, nobody else got a look in and there was nothing in the way of character development for any of the rest of the cast. Although based on the MacLean novel, the historical points relating to German military procedure and behaviour were way off mark. You hardly saw the Nazi salute or a Heil Hitler at all, where historical footage from the Nazi era shows clearly that it was common, indeed required. There were loads of inexplicable things like when Eastwood crept up on a radio operator from behind with the idea of knifing him, then when discovered shot him anyway. The Germans, especially the guards, come over as just fodder for Burton and Eastwood's machine gun fire, somewhat unrealistic. Watching this for the first time you could well get thrilled with the action and suspense, but its weaknesses become all too apparent if you think about it and on a second viewing. Alistair MacLean is undoubtedly a master of suspense action dramas but the lack of attention to detail in Eagles left reality behind for a gun-toting rampage through reality and belief was a bit too much in this case."

In fact, the whole last third of the screenplay where Burton and Eastwood shoot their way past half of the German army is just one such moment after another. Yes, some of the filmic conventions of the 60's jar a little bit on modern sensibilities (like the cars and trucks that instantly burst into flames as they tumble down hillsides and the fact that Burton ""speaks"" perfect German in his plummy English accent). I don't care. The suspense builds and builds and builds until you think you are going to faint, and then all Hell breaks loose in a most cathartic manner, and the whole thing is concluded and wrapped up in a bow for the viewer in the final scene that is still, to me, one of the most satisfying final ""twists"" I have seen in 30 years. (The actor who plays the traitorous ""Colonel Turner"", absolutely rocks in the final scene. I hope the guy who played him made a million dollars and is living the good life somewhere warm!) <br/><br/>I pulled this down (in VHS form) from my shelf on an obscure urge last night to see if it was a good as I remember, and boy, it sure was.

","As a child I used to love all those old war movies set during the second world war but as I grew older I grew to dislike them . The majority of WW2 war films are American of course with a subjectively American point of view ie the Yanks won the war single handed . Not surprisingly two WW2 war films I still love today are DAS BOOT and CROSS OF IRON both of which are German productions . WHERE EAGLES DARE is a British film but suffers from many of the faults as its American counterparts<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by the late Alistair MacLean at a time when even his shopping lists would be produced into blockbusters . MacLean was a schoolteacher by trade but was famous for his meticulous research into the subjects he wrote about which makes WHERE EAGLES DARE doubly disappointing : The Germans/Nazis are portrayed as being cruel and very stupid , they`re also very easy to kill because unlike the British and American characters they find it impossible to shoot straight . In fact it`s totally ridiculous the way Eastwood`s character is able to fire two machine guns at once and throw back the Germans grenades without getting a scratch . In truth the Germans were very efficent on the battlefield while being very cruel off it.<br/><br/>Maybe I`m a bit hard on the movie since it`s not really a war film but a spy story set during the war , a bit like a James Bond film where Anton Differing is Blofeld . It`s also interesting to see Richard Burton play a very similar character to Bond since he was once a candidate to play Fleming`s character and if his performance here is anyhing to go by he might have outdone Connery as a sadistic assassin but probably would have been less convincing as a  sophisticated womaniser . There`s also a brilliant twist where it looks like Smith isn`t who he claims to be but this is the only moment of brilliance in a film with cliched portrayals of Germans and rather poor production values ( Check out the myriad of scenes featuring some painfully obvious back projection ) which won`t appeal to an audience in 2003"

","At least, they were if you believe this movie.  The premise for Where Eagles Dare has real potential.  But this is pure Hollywood stupidity folks. <br/><br/>
The two main Allied agents waltz through their mission, killing Nazis with ridiculous ease, while casually strolling through a hail-storm of bullets. Never once do you get the impression that the heros of this movie are in any danger of death or of failing to complete their mission, despite the supposedly incredible odds against their success.  This makes for a painfully boring movie, completely lacking in suspense, but abounding in absurdity.<br/><br/>For me, the worst crime of this movie is the way it trivialises the Allies' bloody struggles and hard won victories over the Germans during WWII.  The final verdict?  Even Colonel Klink would have been insulted.  Nuff said. <br/><br/>
But if you want the dirty details... (Warning! Possible spoilers and (definite) rants follow.) <br/><br/>
Where else but in Hollywood could a group of British covert agents openly and casually discuss their plans for infiltrating the most heavily guarded Nazi fortress in Germany while sitting in a German pub filled wall to wall with Nazis? (Hello?!) Where but Hollywood could a British and American agent stand unconcealed atop a trolley hundreds of feet above the ground, travelling into the heart of this very fortress, and *not* be seen by the trolley guards, who seemed to be determined to look in every direction except the one from where the trolley is approaching?  Where else would a Nazi guard, *knowing* that Clint Eastwood is an American agent, fall for his extremely lame ""I need to tie my shoelace"" (!?!) line, while travelling in a car!  (Germans know the importance of properly tied shoelaces while sitting in an automobile!) Where else can a single Allied agent (Clint Eastwood, of course) hold off hordes of Nazi soldiers single-handedly?  Not only that, but casually pick up a Nazi grenade tossed at him, and throw it back at the Nazis, taking his time in doing so, whereupon it promptly explodes?  (Were these German grenades designed only to kill Nazis?)  Then, when the plot demands it, a single Gestapo officer orders both of our heros to drop their guns, and they do so promptly, despite the fact that they both have two machine guns to his one Luger and Nazi officers as hostages to boot. <br/><br/>
I'm sure there is more of this incredible stupidity to report, but I couldn't bring myself to watch more than half of this absurd movie."

","Where Eagles Dare has been given the status of one of the best war movies ever produced. I think that statement is going a little too far, but I found the movie to be an effective war film and one of the better ones from an era in which seemingly hundreds of movies focused on World War II were released. Despite the acclaim it has received, it has received notice for historical inaccuracy. Personally I don't mind because the value of a movie is entertainment, not truth. On top of that, this story which was written by Alistair Maclean as a pet project for Richard Burton so it's a work of fiction, so history accuracy should not matter here. The movie is rather lengthy as it clocks in a tad over two-and-a-half hours, but I felt the time flew by quickly. There are plenty of action sequences and most of them are convincing and entertaining. Who wouldn't want to see Allied personnel lay waste to a bunch of Nazi scum? Despite this being a piece of fiction, I was washed over by a feeling of pleasure watching these Allied troops infiltrate a Nazi stronghold.<br/><br/>During the war, a British aircraft was shot down over Nazi territory leaving only one survivor, an American general. The Allies are fearful because he knows all about the D-Day invasion, which holds the key to their success in achieving victory. They decide its best that he not divulge any information to the Nazis, so they plan a rescue mission. The team is led by Major John Smith (Richard Burton)-I know, such an original name right?, and his second-in-command, Lieutenant Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) who happens to be the only American in the rescue group. After the parachute drop goes wrong, it becomes clear to Schaffer that the mission is more important and more secretive than originally thought.<br/><br/>The performances seem to be low-key despite the starpower in the main roles. You know, the one and only Richard Burton and the main famous for his manly scowl, Clint Eastwood. They all did well in their roles, even if their roles are not the best they have ever done. Burton does well in anything he does so it's no surprise he does so here. I like Clint Eastwood, and he puts his action chops to good use here. I read that he thought the screenplay was horrible and he wished to be given less speaking lines. So director Brian G. Hutton gave more of his lines to Burton and allowed Eastwood to focus more on the action. In the end, I think that worked out well.<br/><br/>Where Eagles Dare is a very fun, entertaining movie. The movie has lots of muscle to it, but it surprisingly has a good amount of brains to it. That scene in the headquarters meeting room with Burton revealing some traitors, that was an incredible scene. Burton's character was messing around with the heads of everyone in the room, friend or foe. The action is consistent and they do a solid job. From the beginning with that parachute drop to the infiltration of the Nazi headquarters, to the grand escape with a bunch of Nazis on their heels-it was all good fun watching Smith and crew act smarter than the Nazi's. The movie itself is nothing special, but it's fun, entertaining, and a war thriller that doesn't take itself seriously. Not everything about the film plays off as rational, but does it really have to be? My Grade: A-"

Although the character actors who play the German military(Anton Diffring) and SS command (Derren Nesbitt) in the castle play to the German stereotype, their spats reveal the antagonism that existed between these two groups. Richard Burton's character gave the impression of really enjoying the mission. Clint played his straight-man from the American heartland who is somewhat shocked by Burton's over-the-top character, similar to Eli Wallach in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Watching Mary Ure and the actress who played Heidi play an active role in the dangerous mission made an impression on me when I was younger. Neither woman cowers, but instead contributes to the action and helps to drive the plot on to the end. Their characters also deal more intimately with the male characters. The adult relationship between Mary Ure's capable character and Richard Burton's commando leader is light years from the tense, immature marriage they portrayed in ""Look Back in Anger"" ten years before. Mary Ure's character has a nerve-wracking conversation with the dangerous SS officer minutes after arriving at the castle. Again, an entertaining movie."

In this respect where Eagles Dare gives value to the importance of women's roles in a man's world! The only criticism I have for the director here is the way Ure is portrayed as a second rate machine gunner in comparison to the more immediate and concise shots from Eastwood's character.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it seamed odd to have the great stage actor Richard Burton playing a Bondesque role, and out of the context of his classical performances which his rich voice lend to.

","I absolutely hate this movie. It fits that the same director did ""Kelly's Heroes,"" since both films are equally shallow, lame, and unintelligent. The big difference is that ""Kelly's"" doesn't try to take itself so seriously.<br/><br/>Richard Burton is just outright obnoxious with his I'm-so-in-control routine which grates from the beginning of the film to the very end. Clint Eastwood is almost equally irritating as the silent heavy. It doesn't help that he looks and acts exactly the same as he did in most every other film he made at this time. The story is unbelievable and predictable bad. Everything goes right for the good guys and nothing goes right for the bad guys. You've seen it all before: the bad guys send hails of bullets at the good guys and miss, but one blind salvo from a good guy and he hits his mark.<br/><br/>Or how about the scene where the good guys are making their getaway and destroy every single plane on a German airfield with a snow plow bus. Heck, with that kind of devastation, forget the A-Bomb. The Allies should have just concentrated on driving buses all over enemy territory. What is also laughable is the fact that Burton and his crew have to go through a complicated series of meticulous steps to get their mission to completion, and of course they go through each step like clockwork. It is as if they had the luxury of practicing the mission on location for months ahead of time, and the Nazis were gracious enough to allow them to become familiar with every square inch of the castle they are infiltrating.<br/><br/>Scenes that are suppose to be tense end up being laughable in their lack of special effect realism. For example, the scene where Burton is fighting a couple of Nazis atop a cable car would be hard enough to believe anyway, but the dated, obvious use of a studio film backdrop induces more eyerolling than it suspends disbelief.<br/><br/>Plot ""twists"" are so manipulated they appear to have been tacked on just for the sake of adding twists, and the most ridiculous is saved for the final scene. With everything Burton and crew had to go through, somehow they knew they would end up on a plane at the end with a traitor who would be pointing a generic automatic weapon at them, so, long before they even started the mission they filed the hammer off the gun!<br/><br/>Forget the painful absurdity of how they could be assured that that would be the weapon the traitor would use. By this point of the film, there has been such an accumulation of plot ""twists"" and lack of realism, Burton and Eastwood could have revealed they were really Martians visiting Earth to save mankind and I would not have been the least surprised to see them turn green and fly away. At any rate, I have no idea how this can be considered a ten by some here.<br/><br/>I'm proud to be the first IMDBer to give it a One. Did I mention I hate this movie?"

","Seriously, I don't understand the other comments.. This movie is not as good as they mention it. The first hour is OK, but after then you only watch how good and smart Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are. They don't miss anything. The Germans are so stupid. They just hit Richard Burton 1 time in the whole movie. No people this is just a action movie like Terminator and Rambo. But this time you don't have 1 guy who can't die but 3 guys and 2 women. They are riding in a bus and they are shooten with a bunch of bullets. Do they wound? No of course not! They are so good. They even know when German people are going to shoot. Maybe this was a good movie back then, but for know it is a average movie. I think this movie is just a average action movie, but a realistic war movie? I don't think so."
"Mickey-2","10","5","7","31 January 2003"," Burton and Eastwood against the German fortress called the ""Schloss Addler"". Excellent film
","Richard Burton, who would ordinarily be given roles of less action and hardly any adventure, does a joint effort with Clint Eastwood in this WWII movie, based on the novel of the same name written by the British storyteller deluxe, Alistair MacLean.<br/><br/>Burton, as Major Smith, is given the task of leading a top-rate team of commandos to a German fortress in Bavaria to rescue an American general whose plane was shot down after he had received some advance plans for the upcoming invasion of Europe.  Burton's team includes Eastwood, a member of the United States Ranger corp, trained for combat and secret missions. However, there are some unknown factors built into the mission, namely, MI6, the British intelligence agency, seems to be infilitrated with German agents.  So, Burton's task of rescuing the American general is merely a cover-up, as he is really on task to ferret out all the names of the German agents operating in the British intelligence agency.<br/><br/>Eastwood carries out his part of the mission, the shooting of every German soldier he sees, while Burton, with the aid of an unknown female operative, Mary Ure, attempts to penetrate the fortress, rescue the American, and then, effectively make an escape behind enemy lines to safety.  For those who crave top-notch adventure, seemingly impossible odds, and incredible mountain scenery, with high levels of explosions to match, then I'd encourage those viewers to take a flight/trip to ""Where Eagles Dare.""  One won't be sorry for the time spent."

"johnnyboyz","7","6","9","30 August 2010"," An odd amalgamating of both action and espionage; but these Eagles just about soar, with sustained levels of drama and brash narrative reveals.
","I think we're immersed enough in the text that is Where Eagles Dare by the time the bullets are flying and the explosions are going off; where brains and bravery were key in getting into a heavily fortified base within the piece, the ability to be a dab-hand with a machine gun is all that matters for the film's final third in getting out. But Where Eagles Dare understands explosions, war and wall-to-wall action is only ever effective if those involved within are people we care for; usually, the whole approach to action film-making in providing us with dozens of nameless, faceless, armed to the teeth bad guys whom act as nothing more than cannon fodder to the viewer's favourite actor whom can spend an hour or so shooting up, bores me to tears. Where other such films die on arrival, Where Eagles Dare maintains a sense of interest and peril, predominately because it has an air of film-making about it and this is actually evident long before it has submitted to a forty year premature approach of pertaining to resemble one of those many soulless, first person shooter video games that subscribe to the above aesthetic of anonymous, token bad-guys.<br/><br/>The film will begin with an opening shot of a large and intimidating mountain range which towers over everything, setting the scene for the predominant locale of the film and establishing the predominant traits in that sense of both coldness and of the unforgiving the film has. In an aeroplane, a squad sits dressed as Nazi German soldiers; the two key players of whom are Clint Eastwood's American Lieutenant Morris Schaffer and Richard Burton's English Major, whom sports a playfully inconspicuous name in the form of Jonathan Smith, in a film all about falsities and identity ambiguities. The film's games linked to these very points are announced shortly after this, when a flashback in a debriefing room sees a bunch of officials provide us with the necessary exposition detailing the mission these guys are on. As it turns out, they're only dressed as German soldiers and the aforementioned falsities in identity, albeit in a very basic manner, become ominously clear from an early stage. When the team arrive for the reasons they're there, Smith speaks on a radio without informing Schaffer; later entering a small cabin they've holed up in whilst still in a white, but more importantly, blank uniform as the American sits opposite still clad as a Nazi. Whilst he isn't German in any way, Schaffer's clothing at least suggests a kind of identity whereas Smith's blank outfit, as the camera zooms in on his radio hidden in a pack as the scene terminates, suggests ambiguity and an identify that isn't as clear-cut.<br/><br/>The film is a 1968 co-production between The United States and Great Britain; Eastwood's cold, gruff and expressionless Yank action-man taking the predominant role of being there so as to shoot everybody up when the time comes with Burton's British character, with his smarts, is there so as to provide all the complicated talk which furthers what comes across as complicated narrative twists. In eerily foreshadowing what makes so many contemporary action films so bad, the film might be read into as a systematic foreshadowing of basic chief contemporary British and American attitudes to film-making, albeit in a very crude sense. Namely, a Briton resembling the more methodical and straight talking item to proceedings with the American making hey in spectacle and action. Granted, the film was made several years before Jaws began the unfortunate cycle we now associate with American cinema or the American action-come-espionage genre, but it is difficult to shake the respective auras towards either character and their nationalities within Where Eagles Dare.<br/><br/>Everything leading up to the infiltrating of a large castle in the Alpine mountains of Germany, in actuality named The Eagle's Castle, is intricate; slow burning and really effective. Time is taken to find said cabin; find the castle; spy on the grounds of it; meet with some undercover allies; the task of scoping out the surroundings of the local town located nearby and the eventual entry to the castle. They're there to rescue a top military official whom its thought has some important details related to a top secret operation, director Brian G. Hutton applying by way of both Alistair MacLean's screenplay and novel an effective race against time scenario meaning the leads need to get on with it before he talks. Here is a film in which the characters most certainly shoot their way out but, if anything, do the polar opposite on entry; Burton's calm and methodical approach getting them in to the suited filmic atmosphere, and when the alarm is raised, Eastwood's Major is on hand to all but win the war individually as they strive to get away with, again, the film changing tracts at this point.<br/><br/>The film's centrepiece is this bizarre exchange in a lavish, fire-side dining hall in which, during a film low on overall narrative anyway, suddenly smacks us over the head with a flurry of exposition linked to double agents, mistaken identity and plot which catches us somewhat off guard as everybody stands around dressed in mostly the same uniform. As we strain to work out what just unfolded, we're plunged into a series of tense shootouts and standoffs as the exiting of the castle is given similar methodical detail only with an action sheen; systematically asked to weigh up what we now feel about certain characters given the revelations, Eastwood's own blurry eyed confusion to proceedings aiding in our association with him, fittingly, as the film moves towards a finale more geared towards action. The film is rather enthralling for the best part, Hutton and MacLean know you cannot shoot your way in and sneak your way out but there is tension, enough drama and plot where there initially appears to be no plot to keep one rather engaged."
"Husting","10","6","9","11 January 2007"," Plot line
","Since all the action scenes are covered, lemme describe the plot line. There are a few suspect German agents in Britain. For some time classified information which only the British intelligence and high ranking officers knew passes into German hands. Vice Admiral Rolland plays a game to flush them out. He plans a crash of an American general (who is a corporal) and asks all suspect agents to go on the rescue mission. The ace up his sleeve is Major John Smith himself who is a double agent working for Britain while passing useless info to the Germans! How he convinces the suspects to provide the top German operatives names in the presence of the German officers is superb drama! Read below - <br/><br/>Burton comes in holding the gun against the Germans. He then threatens the American 'punk' to drop the gun and sides with the Germans. He begins to prove his credentials as a German agent. He explains that the others were (his team mates) German agents but captured and now working for the British MI6. He presents his proof in 3 parts. <br/><br/>a. If he is not the German agent, what is he doing here in the company of Germans? And why would he expose the British agents if he was a British agent? <br/><br/>b. Secondly if the suspects claim to be on the German side, then they would know the names of the German operatives or their contact in Britain. He gives them slips and asks each one to note all the names for comparison with his list. <br/><br/>c. He makes them ring a Field Marshall in Italy to confirm that he is indeed a German agent. On confirmation, all the suspects, in their eagerness to prove they too are on the German side, write the names. He gives the books to a German officer and asks him to compare with his own list (Actually blank).<br/><br/>By the time it dawns on the officer that it was a trick to reveal the names, they are under arrest again by the American punk! Guess who is the spymaster?<br/><br/>The drama keeps you on tenterhooks. The mind-boggling action scenes, (mind you - no animation,) test your nerves regularly. Glue yourself to the sofa, or better, nail yourself, else the suspense may throw you! Be warned - ?+?"

","It's fictional, as were Alistair MacLean's other great war stories, but what's unique about Where Eagles Dare is that he also wrote the screenplay (in fact prior to writing the novel). Along with director Brian G Hutton, he created the basis of a two and a half hour+ movie which fairly hums along, not just because of the plentiful action scenes, but because of the intriguing plot line, that just keeps unfolding right up to the last couple of onscreen minutes.<br/><br/>We are literally dropped into the action, along with the British/American extraction team shortly after the opening credits. There is only one brief flashback to sketch out the mission details for us, so we gain more narrative information as the movie timeline progresses, just as Clint Eastwood's Lt Schaffer does. Speaking of Eastwood, this was one of 3 films released in 1968, he had major roles in, that really consolidated his accession to the Hollywood ""A"" list, after he'd made a name for himself in European films. Sharing the lead with Richard Burton was a successful marriage of convenience, as one can't quite imagine Clint pulling off the longish, but necessary expository scenes, such as that around the fire in the Nazi drawing room, quite as well as Burton's Major Smith. That sort of stuff was second nature to the Shakespearian - trained Burton, whilst Eastwood contentedly added to his taciturn, but quietly threatening onscreen persona.<br/><br/>The trademark MacLean twists come thick and fast in the second half of the film, as does the action which ramps up quite a deal, culminating in the extended escape episode from the Schloß Adler, a mountaintop fortress accessible only by cable car or helicopter. And the onscreen action and tensity is only enhanced by Ron Goodwin's well-known soundtrack.<br/><br/>Where Eagles Dare and his follow-up film Kelly's Heroes are the two war films for undoubtedly which director Hutton is most famous. Besides both involving a collaboration with Clint Eastwood, they are generally recognised as being popular modern classics of the genre. Though not necessarily artistically great, they have great entertainment value, which 50 years of time passing, hasn't affected in the least. Definitely worth a look!"

","A stunning combination of plot, character and cinematic beauty. Action movie makers could do worse than watching this movie to see how important atmosphere can be. The early, night-time sequences are eerie and foreboding, the later scenes in the castle capture the beauty of the setting and evoke a time or war that can be deceptively attractive. And there's good reason that the score is still recognized as a classic...superb!"

","This film shall not be missed. Why?

Richard Burton does one of his best performances as the double-sided leader of a group set out to free a prisoner of war. Ron Goodwin's masterful score is his absolute best, and has been copied time and time again. Poor Ron, he only got to compose ""military"" types of scores for the remainder of his career.

The James Bond films are a truer-to-life portrayal of the work of modern day secret agents than this is of Second World War commandos. I have to laugh at the Luftwaffe Bell 47, surely the worst ever anachronism in a WW2 film. The radio operator is listening to music that couldn't have existed before the 1960s. The scene on the airfield at the end where the bus is driven into the North American Harvards (but The Great Escape also indicated that these were used by the Luftwaffe in WW2) and they burst into flames looks daft. An outdated action thriller, popular with boys of the 1970s who built Airfix models and read Commando books and very much of its time.

"zardoz-13","10","5","8","29 May 2008"," Simply Said, The Best World War II Movie About Espionage and Intrigue Made in the 1960s!!!
","Clint Eastwood probably killed more of Adolf Hitler's storm troopers in director Brian G. Hutton's ""Where Eagles Dare"" than he did western outlaws as either Sergio Leone's Man with No Name in the ""Dollars"" trilogy or criminals as ""Dirty Harry"" in his five Warner Brothers crime epics. Bestselling Scottish author Alistair MacLean penned the splendid screenplay that he later converted into a much tamer novel about a team of elite British M.I. 6 secret agents that parachute into Germany to rescue a high-ranking officer with a mother lode of knowledge about the June 6th Normandy landings. This atmospheric MGM blockbuster--clocking in at 158 minutes--is probably the greatest action-adventure opus with a World War II setting ever produced. We're talking wall-to-wall gunfire with more surprises and complications than most movies envisage. Burton and Eastwood appear in top form, and busty Ingrid Pitt and Mary Ure as undercover female agents give them considerable help and guidance. ""Where Eagles Dare"" is also notable for composer Rod Goodwin's percussive orchestral soundtrack. Goodwin carved out a niche for himself in World War II movie soundtracks with ""633 Squadron,"" ""Force 10 from Navarone,"" ""Operation Crossbow,"" and ""The Battle of Britain."" Some war movies take an anti-war stance, but neither Hutton nor MacLean had higher ideals on their collective minds when they made this war-as-an-adventure epic. If you are a World War II movie buff and you haven't seen ""Where Eagles Dare,"" then you need to get yourself a copy of this memorable massacre.<br/><br/>Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern of ""Royal Flash"") sends a group of British commandos on a suicidal mission to rescue U.S.A.F.F. General George Carnaby, (Robert Beatty of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") one of the overall coordinators of planning for the second front, Canby has been is imprisoned in an impregnable mountain fortress called the Schloss Adler, a.k.a 'the Castle of the Eagles.' As it turns out, the Schloss Adler is the headquarters for the German Secret Service in Southern Bavaria. Colonel Wyatt Turner, DSO MC (Patrick Wymark of ""The League of Gentlemen"") informs them that the castle is named appropriately ""because only an eagle can get to it."" Apparently, on a night flight to Crete, Carnaby's British Mosquito was shot down by a wandering Luftwaffe Messerschmitt and the Mosquito crashed in near the town of Werfen. Major Jonathan Smith (Richard Burton of ""Raid on Rommel""), Lieutenant Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood of ""Kelly's Heroes""), Captain James Christiansen (Donald Houston of ""633 Squadron""), Sergeant Harrod (Brook Williams of ""The Wild Geese""), Captain Philip Thomas (William Squire of ""Alexander the Great""), Sergeant Jock MacPherson (Neil McCarthy of ""Zulu""), and Edward Berkeley (Peter Barkworth of ""Seven Keys"") are to parachute into Germany, enter the castle and snatch Carnaby.<br/><br/>One of the sergeants suggests at the briefing that the R.A.F. fill a bomb-laden plane and crash it into the mountain fortress. Rolland reminds him that killing an American general might anger General Eisenhower. No sooner have our heroes bailed out than one of them, the radio operator, is found dead in the snow with a broken neck. The Gestapo raids a tavern in Werfen and arrests the rest and takes them separately for questioning. Smith and Schaffer are hauled away together, but they manage to escape after their car crashes. Smith and Schaffer then climb atop the cable car that ascends to the Schloss Adler. Simultaneous, one of their undercover agents, Mary Ure, is being escorted by a suave but sadistic Gestapo officer in the cable car to work in the castle. Once our heroes have gotten into the castle, Smith interrupts a meeting between high ranking German officers and General Carnaby. Smith proves beyond a doubt to SS-Standartenführer Kramer (Anton Diffring of ""Heroes of the Telemark"") and Gen. Rosemeyer (Ferdy Mayne of ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"") that he is a double-agent working for the Nazis as well as the British with a night-time call to another high-ranking German general.<br/><br/>Eventually, when it comes time to break out of the castle, Smith relies on Schaffer who plasters the place with trip-wire explosives. Once the Nazis realize what is going on, all hell breaks loose. ""Where Eagles Dare"" the movie surpasses MacLean's own novel; he wrote the screenplay and he provides Richard Burton with some of the greatest lines that you'll ever hear in the World War II movie. Indeed, ""Where Eagles Dare"" is the best World War II thriller that Burton and Eastwood ever made, with Burton making more W.W. II thrillers than Eastwood. The rest of the cast is first-rate and composer Rod Goodwin of ""633 Squadron"" provides a memorable score that ramps up the action and intrigue. At 158 minutes, ""Where Eagles Dare"" never lets up on either action or excitement. The surprises that crop up in the narrative match the sizzling action sequences. Clearly, this is Brian Hutton's most memorable film, far better than the action comedy romp that he went on to direct ""Kelly's Heroes"" with Clint Eastwood after ""Where Eagles Dare"" wrapped. For the record, the propeller driven plane that appears during the opening credits is vintage Nazi plane. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the fighter planes that Smith and Schaffer blow up in the last major shoot out sequence.<br/><br/>Hollywood has yet to equal ""Where Eagles Dare."""

I was blown away when Clint Eastwood walked in and gave a short speech about the film to the 100 or so people in attendance. I remember thinking that he was shorter and his hair taller than I imagined.

","Where Eagles Dare was created by Alastair Maclean as a vehicle for Richard Burton, who asked producer Elliott Kastner to find him 'some super-hero stuff for me where I don't get killed in the end'.<br/><br/>Maclean came up with a plot which, though having nothing to do with real life, is at least clever, taking unexpected twists and turns. But it has to be said he didn't depart too far from his first major war movie success, The Guns of Navarone. The scenery and the mission impossible by a motley group of commandos are different, but as in Guns there be a traitor in their midst... Admiral Rolland (Michael Hordern), one of the two senior officers putting the operation together, mutters that it can't possibly succeed, just like his counterpart James Robertson Justice in the earlier film.<br/><br/>Burton, who was aged 45 when the film came out, is obviously too old for the part, but can you be miscast in a film which is your vehicle? His lines are almost entirely made up of exposition or words of command barked grumpily at Eastwood. The heroes mow down scores of German soldiers without aiming their machine guns or being hit themselves (to be fair, Burton cuts his hand closing a door). They seem to know exactly where and when to be at any time as if connected by telepathy. The haircuts and make-up are 1960s, just like the helicopter which lands in the Schloss at one point.<br/><br/>At least the stuntmen did a good job: the famous cable car scene is definitely the highlight of the film (weighing in at an interminable two and a half hours), though that's not saying much.<br/><br/>Where Eagles Dare has aged badly. I can accept it can be enjoyed as undemanding entertainment: but only if you turn a blind eye to the improbability of the action, the one dimensional characters, the mostly wooden acting and the complete absence of any wit or interest in the dialogue."

","A good old-fashioned men-on-a-mission war-time adventure, Where Eagles Dare stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood (the Spaghetti Western star finally shaking off his cowboy persona) as Major Smith and Lieutenant Schaffer, part of a seven man team who embark on a daring raid on a German-occupied mountain stronghold to rescue a captured American general. However, all is not as it seems, with double agents and a hidden agenda complicating an already perilous mission.<br/><br/>Shot on location in the snowy mountains of Austria, this WWII classic benefits from plenty of nail-biting action scenes, lots of nasty Nazis (notably Anton Diffring as icy Colonel Kramer and Deren Nesbitt as slimy Gestapo officer Von Hapen), a couple of sexy ladies (Ingrid Pitt, as undercover allied agent Heidi, reminding me a bit of Scarlett Johansson), and loads of shooting and fighting and stabbing and killing and explosions and noisy stuff like that.<br/><br/>It's gung-ho escapist fun of the kind where none of the actors attempt to speak German (although some do put on an 'Allo 'Allo-style accents) and where the heroes shoot with deadly accuracy but the enemy always misses their targets. At 158 minutes, it goes on for a bit too long, but the pace is snappy enough to avoid boredom setting in, while some of the obvious technical shortcomings (ropey rear projection) can be excused given the film's age.<br/><br/>7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Pitt in her wench costume."

"coolantic","10","3","4","2 October 2018"," Unbelievable but totally enjoyable
","Sorry Yanks, but this is a British movie; even allowing for the presence of Clint Eastwood.
Brilliantly conceived, the screenplay is a cinematic version of the Commando war-story comics in which the Brits always outwit the thicko Nazis at every turn with guile, fists and incredible good fortune. How the Jerries ever got to take over mainland Europe is a mystery when two blokes can defeat a whole garrison of crack troops AND escape with a rescued (all right - fake) general and three spies
Never mind that the coincidences are broad enough to fly a JU52 through. Just enjoy the action. Marvel at Lt Schaeffer's unlimited ammo machine gun. Ponder over the fact that everybody speaks English. Gasp as the plot apparently changes direction three times in ten minutes at the hands and glib tongue of Major Smith.
Stereotypes? This film is crawing with them! Derren Nesbit is blonde, Aryan Gestapo officer Von Hapen. A role that would have been taken previously by Anton Diffring. But, joy of joys, Diffring is also here as SS Colonel Kramer who quickly tears a strip off Von Hapen for pinching his part!
It is impossible to take thi film seriously but that makes it no less enjoyable as a damn good adventure. I well remember the MAD magazine send-up of it, which opens with Major Smith arguing with the Admiral over how many German spies should be taken on the mission. Characters from the Guns of Navarone wander in thinking it's the same movie. Von Hapen is only concerned about who has dumped an old car over a cliff. Oh it's hilarious. Watch the movie as entertainment and you won't be disappointed."

Later at the foot of Schloss Adler, we hear Major Smith tell the blonde agent, played by Mary Ure, that Carnaby's plane crashed near Oberhausen airfield, ""a few miles from here"". But Oberhausen, which does exist, is located at the other end of the country, near the Dutch border, so cannot possibly be the nearest airfield to any castle in Bavaria.<br/><br/>Whereas the Germans did have helicopters early in the war, the one that lands in the castle grounds is too modern by far and bears no resemblance to the early German models. Although this helicopter miraculously reverts to a credible model after landing. I suppose they couldn't get a working version of a WWII copter that flew and didn't opt for a model one in the air - but the difference is striking.<br/><br/>The handguns don't have a big enough silencer (need to be about 7 inches long and 1.5 inches wide) and the machine guns have no shoulder stock of any kind - WWII hand-held machine guns always used a shoulder stock, otherwise the gun would fly back at its user with all the momentum of the stream of bullets and be of no practical use. Also those used by Clint and Mary have no magazine - given the amount of ammunition fired it would take several reloads of a magazine and enough ammo needs to be taken along of course.<br/><br/>But the mistake that dominates for me, is Richard Burton's haircut - it is just way too long for a WWII German Officer - in reality he would have blown his cover instantly, waltzing into the German barracks with that haircut. The main thing that needed to be avoided is the sideburns - the German officers tended to have a crew cut or at least an absence of sideburns or hair reaching the neck! It might seem a trivial point but it just glares at me throughout the film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it is well worth watching for the action and suspense and it also has a very memorable score, the title music being reminiscent of Gustav Mahler."

","I remember seeing ""Where Eagles Dare"" in a movie theater in Phoenix, AZ, when we were vacationing and visiting relatives who lived there. Being a 5th grader at the time, the violence, fake blood and people getting shot in the head or getting a pick ax in the arm was ""cool."" I was swept away by the story at the time, never noticing how unbelievably contrived the whole plot was, even for those willing to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours.<br/><br/>Revisiting the full film after all these years on BluRay (it's been on TV thousands of times in cut-up versions), it actually flows better than I remember. I'm more appreciative of the scenes that act to break the tension in what is basically an action flick with a contrived and twisting plot, the height of which has to be Richard Burton's scene where he explains who he is - or isn't - to the German brass holding court in the eagle's nest. Alastair McLean's plot falls apart if a single scene of his highly inventive story doesn't happen at precisely the time with precisely the outcome as happens in the film. And where did they get all that dynamite?? <br/><br/>The film's biggest drawback is the tedious and repetitive musical score by Ron Goodwin. Yikes! Sequence after sequence of rising pitch that leads nowhere, the score consists of three musical themes that are used and reused to the point of absurdity. Ghastly stuff!<br/><br/>Still, the film is highly entertaining if one can get past the musical score.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood gives an enjoyable performance in this film. It's reassuring to see old ""Squint"" proving that he could once act, stealing scenes with a minimum of effort, which is a real tonic to his most-recent gig as an angry old white guy yelling at an empty chair.<br/><br/>The BD transfer is quite good, especially as WED is a very dark film which usually comes off as an indistinct blur when played on TV. The BD has about as much clarity and contrast as one could hope for in a film that rarely (if ever) sees daylight.<br/><br/>Recommended."

","If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be fun. Everything about it is completely ridiculous, from the massive amount of plot twists, to the even larger amount of explosions (Seriously, where did they keep getting dynamite?). The action, once it starts about midway through the movie, is essentially non-stop, with one chase scene following another. There are shootouts and chase scenes galore! I have no idea how anyone could find this movie slow-paced! The pacing is great. If you're in the mood for a dark, realistic war movie, this is not for you. But if you want to see fun escapism revolving around Clint Eastwood killing Nazis, then you're in for one hell of a time."

He was so convincing in the scene where he gathers the intelligence information from the high brass by fabricating the story about his mission to uncover double agents.  Clint Eastwood can never be bad, either, he forms a mold all of his own for acting (...cip: Dirty Harry).  There were a few flaws (see topic: Why did they do that? on message board)but so what?  Fantastic supporting cast....never a dull moment.  Got my high 7."
"SgtSlaughter","8","3","4","5 July 2003"," Awesome Action War Movie
","An exciting, tense and action-packed British-American thriller with a great leading cast, plenty of familiar supporting actors and some stunning stunt sequences.<br/><br/>In 1944, a British commando team, along with an American OSS operative, parachutes into the Bavarian Alps to rescue an American officer from an impregnable castle. But that's not all that's really going on, and soon the mission is complicated by a traitor in the midst.<br/><br/>Richard Burton (RAID ON ROMMEL) is excellent in an easygoing role as Major Smith, cool and competent commando officer. It's not his best performance - Burton is best suited for large, talky roles - but he appears to be having plenty of fun. Eastwood (KELLY'S HEROES) has a pointless role until the second half of the movie, when his talents as an assassin are portrayed full-blast. He kills dozens upon dozens of enemy troops, the bulk of them in an impressive hallway shootout which forgets logic and proves that in Hollywood, the good guys always win. In support, Mary Ure is a blonde heroine; Michael Hordern the sensitive British commander; and Anton Diffring (THE FIFTH OFFENSIVE); Derren Nesbitt (THE BLUE MAX) and Ferdy Mayne are the 1-dimensional, evil Nazi officers. The commando team is made up of familiar British co-stars Donald Houston (THE LONGEST DAY); Peter Barkworth; William Squire; Neil McCarthy (ZULU) and Brook Williams (RAID ON ROMMEL). Watch for Victor Beaumont as the German colonel who takes the commandos prisoner, and John G. Heller has a one-liner as the German Major in the bar.<br/><br/>
The movie's real stars, however, are the great action sequences. The movie features five spectacular scenes: the first two being nail-biting treks across a valley on the roof of a German ski lift, one of which has characters fighting eachother with ice axes; the third being a series of shootouts and booby trap explosions within the bowels the castle; the fourth, a car chase through the center of a German village and down a precarious, snow-covered mountain roadway as German cars and motorcycles pursue a bus occupied by the heroes; and, finally, a huge explosive finale in which the good guys destroy an entire airfield while making an escape to Britain. Each scene is packed with expert camerawork, great stunts and plenty of explosions and loud machinegun fire.<br/><br/>The third strongpoint is the script and story. Alistair MacLean's screenplay, based on his own novel, is excellent. There are plenty of plot twists to keep you guessing as to who is really a good guy and who is really a bad guy. The pacing is perfect; the movie is just the right length, despite the fact that it's over 150 minutes long. Finally, there is a great - but not entirely unexpected - surprise ending which will make you gasp as everything comes together.<br/><br/>There are a few other technological aspects of the film which don't fall into specific categories. First of all, the scenery is never less than stunning. The snowy exteriors have a beautiful look and deeply contrast the violence occurring in and around them. The castle is appropriately dark and foreboding, adding to the ""evil"" Nazi presence inside. Ron Goodwin's classic score is one of my all-time favorite pieces of music. It adds a sharp edge to the suspense. There are innovative props, too, including some package explosives complete with an easy-to-set built-in timer and tripwire - the perfect item for any commando (or even wannabe commando).<br/><br/>
WHERE EAGLES DARE has been released on videotape several times over the past years. It disappeared from videocassette in the mid-1990s, only for the rights to be sold to Warner Brothers and for the movie to be re-released. Unfortunately, the later releases exclude the intermission, and there is some awkward editing between the film segments. The best way to view the film is on Turner Classic Movies, which airs a restored widescreen print - still minus the intermission, but the widescreen cinematography is absolutely necessary to get the most from the scenery and action sequences.<br/><br/>
WHERE EAGLES DARE is a fantastic Hollywood entry which paints a picture of cinema transition. The action is logic-defying in a way not seen until the late 1960s, when Hollywood began turning away from dramatic pieces all about the story to impressing younger audiences with car chases and violence - what rules cinema today. It was happening in westerns with the revisionist ""spaghettis""; in the long-running James Bond series with the ""license to kill"" motto; and, finally in the war film. It's a product of it's time which stands up quite well today."

Richard Burton is, in my mind, at his absolute best and his performance reflects onto all his co actors, including a very young and very talented Clint Eastwood. I am not a war film fan. I do not even think about the war connection when I watch this film. It is an excellent thriller with great intrigue and style. Ingrid Pitt is also the underrated actress of the film.

Producer Elliott Kastner and director Brian G. Hutton outdid themselves getting larger-than-life production value on the screen. Okay, so there's also a bit of occasional bad rear-projection, plus that old bugaboo of WWII behind-enemy-lines intrigue: Germans who speak German one moment and English the next.

","This is the best war-movie I've ever seen, perfect cast and a great story by the master Alistair MacLean. It's good the movie sticks quite close to the novel, but some corners have to be cut or it would be a 12 hour show. If you've read the novel you'll notice there's quite a bit more violence in the movie, very few guards were killed in the novel but the death count is high in the movie. Also in the endscenes they attack an airfield at dawn to get to their plane, originally they get there in the middle of the night and the airfield is just a simple stip with no barracks or control towers, and no men at night. Fortunately they've kept the excitement from the novel, the true purpose of the mission is not revealed until quite late on, typical for a story by MacLean.<br/><br/>Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood both shines, however I do miss the rough humor that Schaffer uses in the novel, (and his daydreaming about Heidi, and savoy grill), but that's properly not good for a broader movie audience.<br/><br/>I vote 9 of 10 for it as there's a few issues that's a bit annoying: Why do the Germans speak English, but it's the same problem in many other films also. And why couldn't Schaffer end up holding hands with Heidi when they<br/><br/>went home (they did so in the novel.)"

Does it really matter that Richard Burton has a bottomless bag of explosives and barely flinches when he gets shot? (I laughed until it hurt when he merely wrapped a hankie round his hand and carried on as if nothing had happened!).<br/><br/>This film sets out to entertain and it succeeds brilliantly.

","For my generation (born in 1960) this was the definitive adventure/war film. It was released at about the same time as the Battle of Britain, and although a very different type of Film , was regarded almost as being in competition with it and beat it hands down. Quite frankly we had not seen anything like it. Although the Special effects are now dated, the film itself still stands up well. The image of Clint Eastwood standing laconically at the top of a flight of stairs with submachine gun in hand and pausing for dramatic effect before firing created an indelible memory in a 10 year olds memory. When talking to friends of my age about films, inevitably when this film is mentioned they wholeheartedly agree that it is also one of their favourites."
"JR-79","3","15","33","1 June 2004"," Pretty Mediocre Movie
","This movie seemed really interesting on the surface, Clint Eastwood in a war film and a pretty prominent actor in Richard Burton with the lead role. I caught the first 15 minutes of it during TCM's Memorial Day special before I had to go and tend to some things, but since the actors, war theme, and the first 15 minutes had piqued my interest, I decided to rent it that evening and watch the rest of it.<br/><br/>I was pretty letdown. It's pretty a dumbed down action vehicle that was designed primarily for the purpose of keeping two big name actors in the spotlight. About 75% of Burton's lines consist of giving his little orders to people around him like ""Swim to that bank"" and ""Take cover"" and stuff like that, and Eastwood is nothing more than a sidekick that plants bombs and shoots people.<br/><br/>Burton's and Eastwood's characters were supposed to be part of a six man team that went to rescue an American general held captive by the Nazi's, but the other characters of that team do not get developed one iota and mostly serve to be a hindrance to the Burton/Eastwood characters.<br/><br/>Some parts of the movie are especially stupid, like where Eastwood tries to kill a Nazi radio operator by slowly coming up behind him with a knife. When the Nazi spots him, Burton decides to shoot him instead, but not before the radio operator sounds the alarm for help! Really stupid stuff! And this nonsense goes on for over three hours.<br/><br/>There are some things about the move that are worth watching, like the cinematography and some spectacular explosions. However the script is just really dumbed down, and when you don't treat your audience intelligently, all the explosions and camera views can't make up for it. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time expecting a good film in spite of the quality of actors involved.<br/><br/>Rating - 3"

","What a dreadful load of old tosh.<br/><br/>I have not seen this pot boiler for 25 years and now wish I had left it that way. Typical Hollywood (I am using the term broadly due to the British influence) of the era - actors with the wrong looks, the wrong style and the wrong plot, saying the wrong things while pretending to be secret agents pretending to be Germans ( I might add in the presence of cardboard cut out enemies - well they seem this way given their depth and believability) strolling through a movie with perhaps the most improbable plot since the war actually occurred. Don't you love the way the allied agents are all said to speak German perfectly but in the film are actually speaking English complete with their native accents while the nasties (opps sorry, I mean the Nazis) all speak with faux German accents. Pooooo. This pongs to high heaven and I found the entire set up to be dreadfully off putting. Take Clint Eastwood for example, he not only sounds like a yank but looks and behaves like one too, complete with a 1960-1970s era haircut. And its not only him. The bloke playing the Gestapo villain looks and sounds like a spiv complete with a wavy blond haircut. He eternally looked as if he just had a perm and rinse.<br/><br/>And what about the Germans flying around in a 1960's helicopter. Ouch.<br/><br/>This movie truly deserves the rotten egg award.

There's certainly a lot of plot but director Brian Hutton doesn't give the film any lift and it's just all that plot that keeps it going. (It's a long movie; two and a half hours).<br/><br/>The main problem is that it's just a rehash of ""The Guns of Navarone"", (Alistair MacLean obviously knows a good thing when he sees one), but this time it's set in the Alps and with fewer name players. Burton is obviously treading water and Eastwood is wondering how he got himself involved in the first place. Co-ordinating things back at base are Michael Horden and Patrick Wymark and they are more fun than anything else in the picture. Unfortunately, the director doesn't give them anything resembling a look-in.<br/><br/>Despite consistent revivals and the film's considerable popularity it remains the most mediocre of large-scale war movies, indifferently acted and feebly plotted. By comparison, ""The Guns of Navarone"" feels like ""Citizen Kane""."
"screenman","9","4","7","31 October 2010"," Never Bettered.
","Arguably the most successful and memorable screening of Alistair McClean's rip-roaring novels; it is also the most preposterous by a long chalk. <br/><br/>'Where Eagles Dare' is a do-or-die mission with a plot so convoluted that it's almost incomprehensible. A special team are sent behind German lines during WW2 in order to rescue a captured American general and prevent him from divulging all the allied plans. I think that's it - so far. Led by charismatic Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, you know you're in for a rollicking ride.<br/><br/>The general is being held in a castle/fortress deep in the Bavarian mountains. It's unapproachable, impregnable, and guarded by a top SS regiment - a piece of cake in other words. Maybe I should say 'a slice of gateau'. What's more - as in all good action-stories of this genre - there are spies and traitors in the team. <br/><br/>This movie is an adrenaline rush from beginning to end. Our heroes face hazard upon hazard. But at each turn, they run rings around the Germans who are - as usual - depicted as dumb, pedantic twits. Access to the fortress is via cable-car, which provides all manner of seat-edge suspense and drama. The final denouement concerning the American 'general' and the ultimate reason for the mission is so bizarre and improbable that it's a wonder the actors could take it seriously. But they did, and we go along for the ride too. <br/><br/>So much stuff happens in this movie - although the special-effects are gapingly obvious - it's a match for most of the slicker, CGI'd offerings available today. I'd back this hokum against the super-self-important 'Matrix' twaddle any time.<br/><br/>Apart from the flawed special-effects during some of the cable-car sequences, the rest of the movie is tight, taut, and ready to rock. There's bags of pyrotechnics, shoot-em-ups that don't entail walking up the walls; there's believable locations and set-pieces. The castle 'feels' like a castle, the gunshots look realistic. Really; you can't quibble about the camera-work, lighting, editing etc. And there's instantly recognisable theme and incidental music. Top this off with a decent script, two box-office stars and a host of excellent character actors; and there's not much left wanting. Although 'The Guns Of Navarone' is more believable, this movie is the action-maestro of its period. <br/><br/>If you haven't heard Broadsword calling Danny-Boy, then you must be Ellen Ripley.

","I was impressed with this film in 1968 when I saw it at the theater, but then again I was only 19 years old and not a very critical moviegoer. In finally watching it again when I am 64, I am decidedly unimpressed.<br/><br/>First off, the plot is too convoluted. Such a scenario would have never taken place during World War II (or any other time). But, I guess it must have been fun for Alistair MacLean to dream up such nonsense. Second, there are too many mistakes in the film to take it very seriously. Perhaps you didn't notice it, but in the background of a number of shots there were buildings that were clearly not WWII era. When planting explosives to blow up the castle, why would they place them to be so totally obvious, when a slightly different setup would have made them very unlikely to be discovered. And of course, then there's the question of who really is the traitor; a plot device that is as old -- and tired -- as the hills.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, let's start with Richard Burton. In 1968 he was only 43, but he looked too out of shape for some of the more rugged aspects of the mission. So, he seems rather out of place here, although it's always interesting to hear him speak. The choice of Clint Eastwood was more realistic, and although he was only 5 years younger than Burton, he looked physically fit enough to make some of the action scenes seem realistic. Mary Ure? The problem is not her acting, but rather the viability of such a role in the story at all.<br/><br/>The rather long climax of the film -- the escape -- has lots of fun shoot-em-up. But it's also illogical that a literal handful of Allied people could ward of hundreds of Germans.<br/><br/>A decent war film with lots of issues.

""Guns"" was an early story in Alastair MacLean's books, and includes lots more invention than ""Eagles."" By the time he got around to this story, his whole shtick was well-established. If you had read enough of his books (""Breakhart Pass"" included) you knew going in the hero was the most evil-seeming character (Richard Burton), and all the heroics would prove him the one who wins. I read the book long before the movie came out, and the movie didn't do anything to change my opinion of the story.

But then, the entire story at the bottom of the mission is only a Mcguffin! Its only function within the film is to set the main plot in motion and get the characters into action! Yes, all right, Clint carries an inexhaustible amount of dynamite in his backpack, he wipes out an entire Wehrmacht division all by himself, he and the girl empty dozens of magazines upon the pursuing Germans without themselves buying a single German bullet in return, and keeping the soaking clothes on after jumping into the freezing river won't get them a triple pneumonia because they have plenty of blankets and gallons of brandy to warm them up.

","Of which Clint Eastwood had a seemingly endless supply, while the Nazis had none and were also poor shots to a man too. This is how to make a motion picture and entertain people; belief has to be suspended, because of course, all fictional motion pictures are fantasies and are the produce of many peoples imaginations. It's a relentless and engrossing action-packed ride - if some people can't like it they must analyse things too much and without a trace of a sense of humour.<br/><br/>Wartime British army special team are sent to rescue an American General confined by the Nazis in a supposedly impenetrable castle in cold and snowy Bavaria. Except as usual with the British secret services there are many traitors around who craggy Richard Burton has to unmask as well. It's all very stiff upper lip stuff, even the token Yank Eastwood (that's why the Hell he was there) appears as a semi-regal second-rate punk. Between the two of them they bring to their enemy widespread devastation and anachronisms and are totally unflappable while outstaring Death. It's obviously all the result of Burton's character possessing an innate seventh and eighth-sense for danger. Favourite bits: the multiple confrontation between the interested parties at the castle dinner table; the bloody escape from the castle (there were even people left alive!); Burton improbably jumping from one cable car to another; the explosive chasing of the bus to the impossible catching of the instant airplane; many others. How any film can leave in a shot of the entire camera crew reflected in a window and get away with it shows you how much panache this film had whatever the errors littered in it, and how literally escapist it was to make all errors, plot devices and plot holes completely forgivable.<br/><br/>It's so good it's still a regular slot filler on UK TV and one I've seen a shamelessly sad number of times now to know almost by heart. It helps that We Won, I think. But if you know something is enjoyable why dis it just because you've seen it before, why not enjoy it again and again? I've also liked Mars bars ever since the 1960's too. Fantastic entertainment clearly from the 1960's but not as dated as most of the tripey and trippy films made in that decade."

","Plot, acting, action, mystery and suspense, espionage, war — Where Eagles Dare has these and more. And, its many elements are blended well into a film that provides great entertainment. This first-rate film is based on a fiction novel of World War II by British author Alistair MacLean. The top-notch cast delivers very good performances (watch some of the facial expressions of Clint Eastwood, some of the German officers and the men in the mission group; hear the heavy breathing by Richard Burton from his trudging up and down in the snow and frequent climbing, and then his comment at one point on exhaustion). <br/><br/>The main setting is a castle somewhere in or near the Bavarian Alps that provides outstanding scenery. The female roles reflect the importance of the women within the plot without a gratuitous sex scene or aspect so common today. Indeed, that would have reduced the value and characters of the women in the story. There may indeed have been a relationship between two of the main characters, but the movie didn't exploit that with a scene of intimacy that would distract us from the plot. So, in the absence of ""sexploitation,"" we are left wondering  and maybe even imagining a little bit — great aspects of films in the past. But just a little bit, because the plot and action pick right up and carry us on.<br/><br/>The film moves very nicely — with a great mix of action, plot twists and turns, and suspense. In an on-camera interview late in his life, Gregory Peck (1916–2003) said that the quality and value of movies in his day was determined by good stories that have good acting and that entertain the audience. Of course, there are other values and qualities of films as well — to inspire, to inform and educate, to embolden and excite, to confirm or influence, to cause us to pause and reflect with gratitude. These can fall within the many types of film, from action adventures to wars and westerns. But in the analysis offered by the late Oscar-winning actor Peck, Where Eagles Dare fits solidly in the mainstream of great movies that entertain. <br/><br/>I don't watch commercial TV, and hadn't seen this movie but once after its first release — and that last time many years ago. So, it was a treat to watch it again and to add it now to my collection of outstanding films for my family's posterity."
"JamesHitchcock","7","3","5","21 September 2006"," Falls just short of being one of the classic war films
","""Where Eagles Dare"" starts off as a traditional war film. A group of Allied commandos (six British, one American) are being briefed for a dangerous mission. They are to parachute into the Bavarian Alps, where it will be their task to rescue a captured American general from a mountain fortress. The man is privy to details of the forthcoming D-Day invasion (which suggests that the film takes place in the winter of 1943-44), and the commandos will have to rescue him before the Germans can force him to talk. At this point, the audience must be thinking that they know, generally, how the story will work out. The men will succeed in infiltrating the castle and, after a number of setbacks and close escapes which test their courage and endurance to the limit, will succeed in freeing the general. In a nail-biting finale they will manage to get him to safety just ahead of the pursuing Germans.<br/><br/>That is not, however, what happens. It becomes clear that the man the Germans are holding is not a general, but rather (in a plot development taken from a genuine wartime incident which also inspired the film ""I Was Monty's Double"") an actor who closely resembles him and who is impersonating him. One of the commandos is killed shortly after landing, probably by a traitor among the group. The film now starts to resemble a spy drama of the type that were becoming very popular in the sixties (""The Ipcress File"" is a good example)- the sort where every member of the cast is under suspicion of being a double (or possibly a triple or quadruple) agent, and where there is a new twist to the plot every few minutes.<br/><br/>The audience suddenly realise that they do not know how the film will work out- there are too many unanswered questions for that. Who is the traitor? Is it the group's leader, Major Jonathan Smith, who appears to be working for both sides? Is there also a traitor working for British Intelligence in London? Why have the Allies allowed the Germans to capture a fake general? Who are the two beautiful but mysterious young women working in the local Bierhaus? Why is an American taking part in an otherwise all-British operation? (The answer to this question is an important plot point- it is not simply ""so Clint Eastwood doesn't have to bother putting on a British accent"").<br/><br/>This concentration on the spy angle does not, however, mean that conventional military derring-do is altogether neglected. The mountain fortress is accessible only by cable car or helicopter, and, as the commandos do not have a helicopter, there are some cliff-hanging cable-car sequences, both while they are infiltrating the castle and when they are escaping from it. There are a number of shoot-outs, in which (as is normal in war films) the baddies come off second-best, firing off vast quantities of ammunition without ever hitting their targets. Had the Wehrmacht's marksmanship really been as poor as this, the Allied victory would have been much easier than it in fact was.<br/><br/>This is not generally the sort of film one watches for classic acting performances, although both Richard Burton as Smith and Eastwood as the American Lieutenant Schafer are very polished and easy on the eye. The film does, however, have its weaknesses. It is overlong and could probably have been pruned in length by fifteen or twenty minutes two hours or so being the optimum length for an action-thriller of this nature. The Germans sometimes seem implausibly gullible. Most importantly, there is not the depth of characterisation that marks the truly great war films such as ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""Ice Cold in Alex"". As an action spectacular, in fact, the film is a reasonably good one but it falls just short of being one of the classic war films. 7/10"

","A military group made up of six British and one American soldiers parachute behind enemy lines in order to rescue an important British General from the German fortress the Shloss Alder - a mountain top castle accessible only by cable car. Once on the ground one of their group are murdered and the leader Smith suspects a double agent instead the unit. He decides to continue with the mission regardless - but is the aim of the mission as straight forward as he is telling the others.<br/><br/>This is a classic bit of war time adventure. Made possible because Burton wanted to do it because his son wanted to see Daddy in an action movie, this is far superior from most other Alistair McLean adaptations. The story is pure boys own' style adventure - but the source material is clever enough to hold the interest. The truth behind the mission is hinted up for a while before being revealed - it isn't earth shattering but Smith's handling of the situation is very cleverly done and fun to watch. The story goes go downhill a little in the `escape' section - up till then it's all quiet and espionage stuff, however to get out of the castle they merely blow everything up! They also manage to take on the whole German army, picking out targets easily while never getting hit themselves. However this is a minor complaint as some of the action scenes are great - notably the cable car scenes.<br/><br/>Burton is an unlikely action figure but plays the gentleman officer very well, and is totally believable when the twists come in the middle. Eastwood is very young but is suitably brash for the American Schaffer - fans may also be interested to know that his body count is higher in this film than any other in his career. Support is generally good but it's mainly Burton and Eastwood who carry the film.<br/><br/>Overall it's a classic bit of escapism set in WW2. It's quite silly at times but has a clever story to prop up the action."

","There is a fetish among generation x and their late boomer parents for WHERE EAGLES DARE, especially in Britain. Well, I grew up with this movie too, in America, and when I was ten it was the best film ever made. But our tastes sometimes change.<br/><br/>This movie has more facile escapes, unsurprising reversals, and exploding trucks than any two eighties Bond movies. Also it has better photography. Machinery and personnel fall majestically into wide-angle mountainscapes. Eastwood shoots men and women in the back, in the face, stabs them, with psychopathic indifference. Nazi uniforms, guns, helicopters, airplanes, cable cars over snowy crevasses. Castle on fire. Parachutes. Wild chase on windy roads. Much tying of dynamite charges around pylons. Many, many gunfights and scrambles over the edges of roofs.<br/><br/>No doubt there is first-class spectacle here, but if many of the live stunts are more impressive than their modern computer-generated counterparts might be, then it may also be said that many are not. I like it this way. The action was always a plus in John Ford movies, and his old second unit man brings it on with a whole well-seasoned bag of chases and shootouts around corners. I happen to like seeing the dummy go through the windshield. Seeing the dummy defenestrated. Seeing the model bridge blow up. Seeing the real flaming staff car go over the cliff and crash into the real river.<br/><br/>And yet it is boring, and since I grew up I've found that a deadly failing in an action movie. The uneven director, Brian Hutton, seems to fear this time out that to present information succinctly is to miss the opportunity to seem like a roadshow director - never reveal in one shot what you can orchestrate into three scenes. It's too bad, because this kind of movie can be great. THE WILD BUNCH, DELIVERANCE, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING, APOCALYPSE NOW, other sadistic or amoral boy's-adventure films I grew up with, have not become as hard to watch as this one.<br/><br/>One of the primary elements of adventure is timing, and this movie is an hour too long. Burton nearly falls asleep during his own monologue, and Eastwood sits placidly on the roof of the tram, dangling half a mile in the air as if he's sitting on a park bench, for almost two minutes, apparently thinking about his laundry. If it were the just the second hour that sucked, it would be forgivable: one could turn it off when it became too dull, like the aforementioned Bond movies, which are top-loaded with thrills and degenerate nearly always into elaborate yawn machines. Sadly this movie wastes an hour over the course of its entire length, so that we have action roughly every twenty minutes for the first two-thirds of its bloated running time before it becomes consistently watchable.<br/><br/>It is interesting from a sociological perspective to see Clint Eastwood play an American soldier of the 1940s impersonating a Nazi officer in Jim Morrison sideburns and a pompadour. I had the time to spare when I was ten."

I like Eastwood a lot but in this movie you really can replace him by some statue. b) the story is far too complicated. All they have to do is to free a British soldier but for some reason (Alistair Maclean is the real reason) this has to be a wicked spy-story that no one understands...or it must be because I was standing outside smoking a fag. c) it's far too dated and too unrealistic. War is cruel you know but Eastwood and Burton are hanging on some cablelifts just like they're sitting in a chair, not that I'm a purist but let Stallone do that and at least he should have yelled something. d) The Germans here are portrayed as the most stupid soldiers ever, not that I care that much about it but for Eastwood and Burton these soldiers are just like some mosquitos they have to kill....

","I came to this movie after reading author Alastair MacLean's novelisation of the film, not realising that unlike earlier film adaptations of his books, this time the film came first. Actually I preferred the book anyway as for me both Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood didn't suggest themselves to me as the actors who would portray Commander Smith and Major Schaffer. In fact I'd argue that they're both miscast anyway, Burton is way too old and bulky for an action movie of this type and Eastwood is too taciturn and cold in his part, probably killing more Germans than the words of dialogue he speaks. There's no real sense of camaraderie between them either.<br/><br/>The story is naturally reminiscent of the writer's earlier success ""The Guns Of Navarone"", being another seemingly impossible mission to an impregnable location by a small team of crack soldiers, led by an older man with of course treachery in the air within and without the group itself. There are lots of derring action sequences including several explosions, car chases and especially the climactic scenes on top of a descending cable-car, however Eastwood's own wry rechristening of the film as ""Where Doubles Dare"" is borne out in almost every scene of exertion or danger as the director invariably cuts to stunt men and women in bulked up weatherproof gear, shot from the back to mask their features.<br/><br/>In supporting roles, I liked the work of Mary Ure and Derren Nesbitt better than the leads, the former as the utility girl who secretly joins the group, the latter as a high-ranking Aryan- looking S.S. Captain but Peter Barkworth for one is wasted, barely speaking a line as one of the minor members of the team, he was of course later put to better use in this kind of setting in the BBC's long-running TV series ""Colditz"".<br/><br/>The body count is pretty high throughout with the Germans as usual in films like this inexplicably missing our heroes when it's easier to shoot them, plus there are a number of jarringly obvious old-fashioned process shots in the days before green-screen. <br/><br/>It's still a decent actioner evocatively shot in winter against a dramatic Alpine backdrop, but, like Burton in the lead role, it does rather show its age at times."

Mary Ure has a rare leading role and the supporting cast including Patrick Wymark as the imprisoned General, Robert Beatty, Ferdy Mayne, Donald Houston and Anton Diffring make for a memorable motion picture with great sets and snow-capped landscapes. Don't miss Ingrid Pitt in another brief but important supporting role.<br/><br/>Though the plot twists are real humdingers, to me the most remarkable aspect of this film is the story of its director, Brian G.Hutton. A man who had ""The Wild Seed"", ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""Kelly's Heroes"" under his belt before the age of forty, drifted into obscurity in the mid-seventies and apart from ""High Road to China"" in the mid-eighties, never seemed to fulfil the promise of a long and truly great career.

","Total escapism, two soldiers manage to hold off an elite battalion of the Waffen SS, kill over 100 Germans and escape with barely a scratch. I think when When Eagles Dare was released, with the Bond franchise in full flow, the producer must have wanted a war film with the same appeal. ( The novel has far less action and the plot is more complex.)<br/><br/>Basically the plot is this. An American general has been captured by the Nazis and as he has full knowledge of the D Day landings, British intelligence send out a team to rescue him from a mountain top castle in southern Germany. However, while the team( particularly Richard Burton and Clint Esstwood) make a very good job, of fighting off the Nazis to rescue the general, all is not what it seems. Two members of the team are traitors working for the Nazis, the famous cable car fight scene features the demise of the two traitors, and in the final scene the general reveals he is a Nazi agent before jumping out of the plane. A clever twist on what is a shoot em up action movie.<br/><br/>However, apart from the catchphrase Broadsword calling Danny Boy and the plot twist, most people sit through Eagles simply because the action is so good and like James Bond in a second world war situation. The bus chase, the cable car scene, the hijack of the plane, and some fantastic shootouts at the Schloss Adler, are what people remember the film for. Yes it's a fantasy, but a good one and the film still has millions of fans today."

While Eastwood squints as he hurls dynamite and fires his machine pistols into the torsos of unsuspecting Germans, Burton shows off pyrotechnics of a different kind, bearing a brandy glass as he confronts a group of Nazi officers with the evidence that their prize double agents are not what they seem to be. Burton calls Eastwood a ""second-rate punk,"" while Eastwood suggests that Burton keep it ""an all-British operation"" next time out, and you smile not just because they are winning but keeping you entertained all the while.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly sharp and challenges you more than you expect, enough to appreciate the film's two-and-one-half-hour running time because it takes that long to sort out all its twists and turns. Screenwriter Alistair MacLean, working from the same story he made into a novel the previous year, 1967, doesn't insult your intelligence as much as he takes liberties with your indulgence, and that is the difference in why this film is so well regarded. I read somewhere that Quentin Tarantino is inordinately fond of this film, and I can see why, because the humor and thrills are kept in steady, logic-defying supply.<br/><br/>There's also a vibrant sense of atmosphere, not only with the mountain fortress and the Bavarian village beneath it but the funicular which connects it, and where Smith must face his most rabid adversaries in a sequence that is the most thrilling in this very thrilling film. As Smith, Schaffer and their companions wend their way through twisting corridors, dodging bullets and each other's quips, you feel yourself running alongside them, in a way few films manage to pull off.<br/><br/>A lot of what makes ""Where Eagles Dare"" special is the fact it does pull you alongside the heroes, making you feel their panic and elation first-hand. The back-handed compliment many offer here is that it is a ""Boys-Own"" adventure in the classic British tradition, forgetting that such a story requires as much if not more subtle brilliance than the ""kitchen-sink"" dramas more commonly embraced.<br/><br/>Is it better than MacLean's still slightly-better known film yarn, ""Guns Of Navarone""? That earlier film does ask some interesting questions about man and warfare which ""Where Eagles Dare"" ignores, but given that the latter film is more entertaining and amusing, I feel at a loss to say one is better or worse. Maybe if there had been a film version of his greatest book, ""H.M.S. Ulysses,"" the question would be moot. Let's face it, if World War II was good for anything, it was good for giving us a world that allows us to ponder such questions.<br/><br/>Why an anachronistic Nazi helicopter, especially when it adds nothing to the film? Why the annoying Gestapo officer, only slightly less superfluous? But even the weaknesses of this film lend a certain atmosphere to the proceedings, which one wishes were more common to such fare. Action films don't have to be low-brow when made with such care and joy.<br/><br/>Nice work also by Patrick Wymark and Michael Hordern as the overseers of Smith's mission, stiff upper lip and all that to the end. Hordern is every bit the mordant narrator he would be in the later ""Barry Lyndon,"" while Wymark's plummy turn reminds me of Robert Osborne getting ready to introduce another Turner Movie Classic. However played with one feels watching this film, one never feels cheated with all the talent and intelligence on display."

","This is one of the few films that I could see again and again. From the stirring music at the beginning with the aircraft seemingly appearing from nowhere, to the climactic bus drive to the airport, the story is compelling. The twists in the plot, and the sheer audacity of the operation is a joy to behold. Occasionally one has to suspend belief (the fortunate escape from the car on the way to interrogation is a good example), but the setting of the scenes, and the destruction that two men cause is highly enjoyable. One is able to forget just for a few hours the stresses of reality, and when the film finishes one almost could rewind and start all over again!!<br/><br/>The final declaration of the double agent, and the length to which he was driven out of hiding makes this film a real winner. Having the screenplay written by the author is I feel a testament to the book, and even if Richard Burton can be slightly ""sleepy"" in some scenes, it is a role that I would like to have had!"

Watch it with the A/C turned down, in a dark room with the sound turned way up! ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy..."" Richard Burton gets first billing for this but that was okay.

"dnaples","8","2","3","1 November 2004"," Wow, a very good, well-paced WWII Action-Adventure: worth watching, more than once!
","I've been listening to the soundtrack for the last few years, but never saw the movie - yes, that's a little 'round-about I know. But I finally TiVo'd this movie last week off Turner Classic Movies and gave it the better part of a sunny Saturday afternoon in October. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>First, it's written by Alistair MacClean, AND it's not an adaptation, but written specially for the movie. Like many war movies there are some liberties taken in characterization of the enemy, but it's for entertainment, not history. I'm not politically correct, so I'm not put off by a ""flat"" characterization of German soldiers. Most of them are just cannon fodder anyway, so why develop them too highly. I am, however, pleased by the active role played by the two British female agents. Hail Mary - with a machine gun!<br/><br/>Second, bigger wow - this was 1968! I am so tired of the modern trend in Sfx towards bigger and flashier productions that overpower or substitute for a story. This has a real story. I like the British spy genre, because the value is upon intrigue more than action. Not until the end of the movie do you realize the purpose of the various errands by Eastwood and Burton. Only this genre would how you how meticulously planned is the escape, as well as the ""storming of the castle."" Most modern films would just show ""a chase,"" and a lot of improvised mayhem to effect an escape. <br/><br/>Third, it kept me guessing. I knew there had to be a double agent, but I was hard pressed to figure out who. Like Lt. Schaffer during the denouement, I was ""as confused as I could ever hope to be."" And again, only the British would allow the gentlemanly ""other option.""<br/><br/>Finally, for being nearly three hours long, this move held my interest. I appreciate movies that exceed the standard 100 minute formula, and I enjoy them even more when they are paced well. If this movie was as well written, but 30 minutes longer, I would still watch it. <br/><br/>If you're a ""fan"" of either of the lead actors, this is a good movie to see them in a ""non-standard"" role. I'm not old enough to remember any other Richard Burton films, and while not really a ""fan,"" I've certainly seen my share of Clint Eastwood movies. And this is as good as any, and better than many."

","I grew up with this movie. It forms part of my basic makeup. I have seen it so often I think I may actually have been in the movie in another life.<br/><br/>The most expensive movie of it's time, it makes its mark by squeezing as much derring-do out of the stirring book as possible, bringing in major stars (Eastwood, Burton, bundles of great British actors and actresses) and throwing all of it into a wonderfully ridiculous plot, involving triple-crosses and misinformation for everyone in sight.<br/><br/>Some great, great action sequences (the cable car, the bus escape), some wonderfully wooden dialogue down at ye friendly local hostelry ""zum wilden Hirsch"", and some great work by the stuntmen(seeing Burton was more than a little overweight by then, I still find it a long stretch to imagine him doing more than staying in the pub).<br/><br/>The plot itself is not really important, they just don't make movies like this any more! To believe it, get hold of the disc and watch the original ""making-of"". A more portentous piece of self important nonsense you are not likely to see, but that is what gives this whole thing such charm.<br/><br/>Throw in a by now quasi-anthemic soundtrack (whoever has seen this film can never forget the opening sequence as the Junkers come puttering towards the camera) and you have boys' heaven.<br/><br/>8 out of 10!"

The power casting of Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton is a little wasted in this sort of thing, but they look like they are having fun. Those looking for feminist brownie-points should note the blank-eyed Mary Ure who handles a machine gun like she is using a hairdryer!<br/><br/>It is is said that this is Clint Eastwood's most murderous role, I would hate to think how many people he shoots here. Certainly their ammunition bag seems not have a bottom in it. <br/><br/>This is not meant to be taken seriously and the use of helicopters does seem a bit out of time (indeed the model used is way out of time!), but we are only in a video game land so we can't dwell too much.<br/><br/>Interestingly the Austrian castle in the film had never been stormed in real life and some of the extras employed in the film had been around at the time of the real Nazi uprising!

","I liked it a lot and I'm hard to impress. They don't make them like this anymore. I'm a Clint Eastwood fan and this is a good Eastwood picture. I even like the film's hypnotic blue-ishness. The music is cool too. Its not a film that you would take all that seriously, and if you do, you're wasting your time with this. You will just annoy others with your complaining about the improbability of much of the story. I've read that of all Eastwood's flicks, he kills the most people in this one. That alone should make it ""must see"" for any normal red-blooded American. I especially love the scene where Eastwood walks into a room where one Nazi stands guard and another sits at a desk. Clint (Lt. Schaffer) is carrying a suitcase (full of weaponry) and calmly says ""at ease"", sets the suitcase down on the desk in front of the guy, says ""Hello"", opens the suitcase up, takes out a gun and shoots the guy in the head. That scene always makes me chuckle. You have to have a sense of humor about these things. Anyway, I highly recommend the film. Its one of my all-time favorites."
"musickna","9","2","3","30 November 2003"," Highly enjoyable (none-too-serious) war/spy adventure yarn
","This film, a favorite of my boyhood, has been recently re-released on DVD with a good remaster that somewhat improves on the rather gray and washed out hues of the original movie. Watching it again, 30 years on, I was surprised how enjoyable it remains.<br/><br/>A wildly improbable spy yarn, with seemingly a radical twist every 20 minutes, it succeeds largely because it does not take itself too seriously. The acting is laconic - hovering on the edge between spoof and earnest drama and holding that position without wavering. Considering no more than a handful of heroes almost effortlessly defy several thousand supposedly elite German mountain soldiers, this is probably an appropriate approach to take! Lots of explosions and gunfire - so nice to see and hear 'real' black powder and blanks rather than the computer generated stuff of today - and the movie is very well paced considering there are some wordy patches as the convoluted plot is divulged. For me, one of the highlights is watching a Junkers Ju-52 flying over the spectacular Alpine scenery while Ron Goodwin's excellent score - one of his best - swells in the background.<br/><br/>
Strongly recommended if you are looking for an exciting war adventure movie without an overly serious core."

","If you like James Bond, then you'll like ""Where Eagles Dare.""  Actually, this movie is somewhat better than the average Jame Bond movie.  And I love James Bond.  You always know where you stand with Bond.  Spectacular scenery in far away places; a car chase; and some pretty ladies to decorate the sound stage.  There's a good guy and a bad guy.  The good guy is gonna win, and the bad guy is gonna lose.  All that is known up front, before the movie starts.  Nothing to think about; nothing to ponder; nothing to worry about. Just good entertainment.  The interesting part is how it all unfolds.<br/><br/>We have a similar formula here.  There are some changes of course.  A little more espionage, and a plot twist here and there, and of course the violence of the Eastwood Western.  Add it all up, and you have ""Where Eagles Dare."" All that changes is the time period, the setting, and the suit.<br/><br/>The violence in this movie is a little less mindless than it is in most films being made today, and there is no useless swearing and cursing.  What a pleasant change of pace from many films where the producer and/or directory haven't got enough confidence in their product to sell it without offensive language.  <br/><br/>It is true that the plot in this movie is somewhat farfetched, but so are the plots of most movies.  And if you can't deal with an indestructible superhero, then perhaps you should stay away from the movies and be content to play with your rubber duckie."

The adventure comic books were great escape from reality. They were based on fact, but not always one hundred percent accurate. They were good, and I loved 'em. I think that is why I like this movie so much; for the same reasons. I have a huge collection of war and adventure movies, and I place this one at the top of my favorites.

","To all the critics..... O.K  if you want Shakespeare, go find some. This movie does not pretend to be anything else other than a great adventure romp. All-right, so  there are more and bigger holes in the plot than the holes in General Carnabie's Mosquito plane....but to quote Richard Burton..."" a hole is a hole is a hole as they say"". Get over the cranial whinging and sit back and enjoy for heaven's sake. Having got that off my chest the main reason for this review is that at last this movie is to be released in DVD format and wide-screen no less ( only region 1 it seems ). This is cause for joy since those lucky enough to own BIG BIG screen systems will enjoy the great shots of the Bavarian (supposedly )Alps and the terrific opening sequence of flying through the mountains.<br/><br/>All these shots suffered of course on most tiny T.V screens in normal format. A YOUNG Clint Eastwood get's nice screen time and works well with Richard Burton ( who by the way ""sure has a lot of women stashed around this country "" according to Eastwood ). There are no obscenities nor close-up shots of entrails.... not needed.. the movie stands by itself. Yes, yes of course only 4 allies can beat 1 million Germans, etc but who cares ? Get the goodies out of the fridge and wind the volume up and be swept along. Some call this movie a ""cult movie "" .. if so, well OK but it's a pretty big cult. Enjoy"

The rest of the SS are in feldgrau (field grey) the black was used only for Hitlers SS guard and other top henchmen at this stage of the war.

","I feel I'm preaching to the converted when I cite this as the finest, most richly atmospheric adventure film ever made.  This is about mood as much as all-out action.  It inhabits that strange escapist realm of nostalgia, of a never-ending childhood spent playing out of doors, of conjuring wild adventures where imagination and the thrill of anticipation are everything.<br/><br/>
Why even begin to criticise the film's total absence of realism and plausibility?  Immerse yourself instead in the beautiful, haunting snowscapes, the gloomy, winding corridors and stairwells of the infamous 'Castle of the Eagles'.  You'll find such escape easy.  Here is a film not afraid to dwell on the minute preparatory details of a high-risk mission. It patiently builds to the action sequences, avoiding the dizzying, elliptical editing style of so many modern-day action films who mistakenly favour the `now' over the suspense of an evocative build-up.  WHERE EAGLES DARE rewards patience, as the snow and the chill and the gloom are given the necessary time to envelope, to ingrain themselves in the mind.  What of the DVD release?  Let's hope that it too rewards patience when it finally sees the light of day."

","Richard Burton is at his best in this superlative film detailing the story of U.S. and British special forces extracting a captured General from a well-defended German castle.  The film is quite long but its unending suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Not to sound macabre, but I particularly enjoy the ""cable car scene"" where Burton, after much battling, eventually tosses a few German soldiers to their death.  Clint Eastwood, playing the role of an American Army Ranger, delivers a fine performance as well.  I first saw this film as an 11-year-old and still enjoy watching it today."

"Kurt-27","9","1","1","5 March 2001"," The classic fun WWII Action/Adventure movie...
","Some criticize that `Where Eagles Dare' is historically inaccurate and implausible.  Well, this is Hollywood popcorn entertainment not a History Channel documentary.  Its fun fantasy that will bring back memories of your childhood G.I. Joe days. Yes, character development is weak, but not at all necessary.  Its all about watching these cool guys pull off this impossible mission.  I love how we are taken step by step how they make their way in, then out of the castle.  But, herein lies the only real problem with the film.  The slow pacing of each detail in certain phases of the operation drags at times compared with the fast pace of contemporary action films in this post Die-Hard era.  For example, ***MINOR SPOILER*** at one point Clint Eastwood gets out of a German car, walks back to a dead German soldier (whom he had pushed out), picks him up, walks back to the car, dumps his body in the car, backs the car up,  pushes the car across the road, then pushes the car over a cliff.  The whole scene is shown in real-time taking about 2-3 minutes of screen time!!<br/><br/>While obviously an action adventure movie, it's more specifically a `team mission' movie like The Dirty Dozen or a `penetrate the impenetrable fortress' movie.  Talk about not making 'em like this any more!  There are plenty of fight scenes, chases and Nazi shoot-em-ups.  Richard Burton is great ...as cool John Wayne or Sean Connery ever were.   One nice thing about fight scenes in an older movie like this, is that you can actually tell what's happening (one benefit of the slower pacing).  The snowy exterior locations and castle sets are wonderful and the two girls are gorgeous.  There are several James Bond style set-piece action sequences. Burton's line to Major von Hapen in the interrogation room is classic... ""we've just uncovered a plot...""  The story is clever and classic Alistair MacLean.  Hopefully, this gem will be out on DVD soon."

Once their mission is accomplished the team spend about an hour fighting their way to freedom, every time they finish one section and you think they're away something else crops up and there's more Nazis to kill, more ground to be gained. Great suspense threatens to draw you right off the edge of your seat and onto the floor, as both stars try to out-cool each other. The rest of the cast don't really need to do much apart from follow their leads or get killed, but that doesn't matter ? this is all about heroism and ingenuity from Clint and Richy. Rousing."

","This movie has much to commend it.  As a conventional war movie, it falls short, but as an entertaining spy thriller set in central Europe during World War II, it succeeds admirably.  Author Alistair MacLean is well-known for his willingness to step outside the normal conventions of war movies, and he delivers in Where Eagles Dare.<br/><br/>At three hours or so, this is a long film, but it always glides by for me. If you haven't yet seen it (or read MacLean's novel), you should have fun watching it and trying to guess at the numerous plot twists.  I've seen the movie a handful of times and always enjoy watching the cinematography, the nicely done action sequences, and Richard Burton's performance.  Although it is perhaps not quite as groomed as MacLean's The Guns of Navarone, it is at least as entertaining.  (I have the feeling, however, that men probably will enjoy this film more than women.  I've tried to get my wife to watch it at least twice, and she always falls asleep.  Apologies to Burton and Eastwood.)<br/><br/>Give the film a shot.  It's definitely worth the time spent."

With that, and the remaining ten minutes of screen time, this actually became one of my favorite movies ever. It was three more years before I caught it again (remember, this was the early 80's, and even WITH cable, there were only 25 or 30 channels)and viewing it in it's entirety only solidified my love for this film.

"The Bronson Fan","4","9","26","18 March 2005"," What should have been a classic WW II movie falls flat.
","Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton star as allied agents that are sent deep into German territory to rescue a captured American General. The general of course is hold up in a German castle/fortress that will be hard to crack and they must go up against some of Jerry's finest. ""Only an Eagle can get there."" Or in this case a helicopter as well. A suicide mission for sure, though one will find that hard to believe after viewing this movie. But the mission is in danger right from the start. There are double agents involved and twists are at every turn. Or so they said. Lt. Schaffer (Eastwood) and British Major Smith (Burton) parachute into the Bavarian Alps with some extras and make to their way to a German town garrisoned by many Wehrmacht and SS Units. Here they make contact with a couple of women who are secret agents. Ellison (Mary Ure) helps and they manage to ditch the guys who dropped in with them, cause there cover was blown. Eventually they make their way up to the fortress and conduct their operation and rescue the general, all while battling crack SS units with no casualties in sight. They finally escape and are whisked away by a stolen German Junkers plane the Brits are flying. On the plane Burton reveals that he knows the traitor is the colonel who sent them off on the first place. Rather then face a trial the traitor jumps to his death and the movie ends.<br/><br/>This movie was a big disappointment to say the least. Eastwood and Burton are totally wasted in this film. Obviously it was for the star power that gave this film any kind of reason to see it. What should have been a great move with an equally great story falls flat. From start to finish Eastwood and Burton walk through their roles like a couple of wooden actors. The story itself starts out interesting enough, but becomes totally confusing and left me with the feeling of ""who cares"" when the secrets come to light. Why does there seem to be so much praise for the Gestapo agent? He looks more like a blonde clown with a wig then a scary character. The only characters that came across right seem to be the high ranking Germans.<br/><br/>The story may not have been the worst part, but more important was the lack of accuracy in this movie. As a historian I found I quit laughable that a helicopter was being used by the Nazis to fly in some General.???? In WW II?! The Nazis were very far ahead in jet propulsion, but I was unaware that they had also managed to develop working helicopters that were that advanced. Only the most limited version would have been around. Its one thing for movies of old to use painted American vehicles for something else because in many cases we did not have them or could not reproduce them on screen, but such a blatant inaccuracy is beyond stupid.<br/><br/>Another bad point is that they fail to really show the ""Language Barrier"" that would obviously exist between the nations involved. Well Hollywood decided that they would just make everyone speak English and forget about the problems involved. Since they are secret agents /special forces they would be trained in duel languages, but at least put on a decent accent. In other great movies of the time they address this in a better way, such as The Dirty Dozen or The Longest Day. At least some Germans speak German though.<br/><br/>The action gets to be repetitive after awhile and quit fake even for Hollywood. Do you really expect me to believe Eastwood would hold of so many crack SS troops so easily. And on they went nailing Germans from far away with guns, that were not all that accurate and the Germans of course missing every shot. We are treated to more and more scenes that are just laughable to watch. There are to many to mention but here are just a few.<br/><br/>1. As they land one of their comrades is killed, a soldier asks should we bury him or leave him here. Burton says let the snow cover him To bad its not snowing! <br/><br/>2. If you are sneaking into enemy lines and blending in, why would you openly discus the mission at hand in a public pub.<br/><br/>3. The stars are being taken away in a car, Eastwood needs to ""tie his shoe"", then overpowers the enemy and the car crashes killing all but they are barley injured.<br/><br/>4. Why would Eastwood and Burton who are armed better and have hostages give up their weapons to a clown who has a pistol? <br/><br/>5. How much dynamite did they pack in those backpacks? No matter when or where they pulled one out and had it ready to do their biding. Even Rambo only carried so many detonators. And don't get me started on how they worked.<br/><br/>Overall this move should have been great but turns out very poor and rather comical in many instances. If they had done a better job on acting, dialogue and actions scenes it may have been good. If your looking for good WW II movies there are far better ones such as The Dirty Dozen and The Longest Day. Eastwood made so many great movies but this is obviously not one of them. Overall a 4 1/2 out of 10 stars for this. The Iron Maiden song of the same name is far better."

","OK, I confess - I used to like this movie. I first saw it in an army movie theater, and the projector bulb blew out just as the bus drove onto the runway. (The projectionist was out for coffee and was damn near hanged when he returned) At the time it provided an enjoyable three-hour respite from duty, but the movie sure doesn't stand up to repeated viewings. A commando team penetrates a mountaintop Gestapo HQ accessible only by tramway, kidnaps a prisoner, and escapes intact after practically blowing it up??? Puh-leeeez. Richard Burton, who I suspect was in his soused period here, sleepwalks through the movie. Clint Eastwood is horribly miscast. Derrin Nesbitt's SS officer is right out of a comic book. The showdown scene in the interrogation room has more twists and turns - all ridiculous - than a bowl of linguine. I admit I still have a soft spot in my heart for this adventure flick, but I can't see myself getting through it again. For fictional WWII yarns, Maclean's ""Guns of Navarone"" is far superior."

","Directed by Brian G. Hutton and adapted to the screen from his own novel by Alistair MacLean, Where Eagles Dare stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. Music is scored by Ron Goodwin and cinematography is by Arthur Ibbetson.<br/><br/>A small group of allied agents are sent on a mission to rescue a Allied General from a Nazi castle stronghold. But there is more than what meets the eye here...<br/><br/>Boys own men on a mission in grandiose strokes, MacLean's complex story makes for riveting and exciting entertainment. The story twists and turns like a Python on acid, thus requiring full attention to conversational details is very much advised. And yet joyously it's the fun and kinetic action that holds the most attention, especially for what is quite an explosive and thrilling last third of picture. There are stunts galore amongst the Austrian Alps (beautifully photographed by Ibbetson), and as the espionage hokum reaches its crescendo status, so does the kinetic carnage, with the makers wasting no opportunity to blow everything up.<br/><br/>Burton is classy and enjoying himself, Eastwood laconic and cool, while good support comes from Mary Ure (great to have a well written spunky female lead), Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern and Donald Houston. The running time is a touch too long as MacLean's prose is given weighty treatment for extended chatter, and some back projection work feels unnecessarily cheap for such a grand production, but this is good old machismo fuelled classic cinema regardless. 9/10"

","Wow. I don't believe I've read anything by MacLean, or seen any other adaptations of his work, or, apart from this one, watched films directed by Hutton, but I can promise you, they are both on my ""must check out""-list from now on. This is, simply put, excellent. The story is impeccably well-thought out, well-told, and with so many twists that you'll come out of your viewing unsure if up is now officially down, and they actually all hold up. They also aren't there to distract from anything else in this, because it all holds up to scrutiny. The production value is extremely high, everything looks, sounds, behaves and feels accurate and true to life. To an extent, this is even rather realistic. The action is astounding, cool without trying too hard at any point, and plenty of it without it ever getting boring or repetitive. Script, characters, dialog, all of the writing is magnificent. Eastwood rocks, as usual. While this may be one of the first times I experience Burton in a movie, I am now quite open to more of his roles. The pacing is spot-on. Acting is beyond reproach. This builds tension, excitement and mood with an admirable skill and talent. To anyone that has had some exposure to both, it is obvious that the video-game series Commandos is heavily inspired by this, perhaps among other, cinematic classics. If you are reading this, and you have only taken in one of the two, and you liked what you got, I urge you to go for the other, as well(unless you don't play VG's, which is fine). This has mild violence, and a fairly vague sexual reference(children may not pick up on it). The DVD contains a well-done featurette entitled On Location that I will review on its own page here on the site, and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to, frankly, everyone, though guys may enjoy it to a greater extent than women. 8/10"

"rmax304823","6","3","7","26 September 2008"," The Guns of Germany.
","The two Allied impostors, Richard (""I've been through hell"") Burton, and Ciint (""My Mule Don't Like You Laughin' at Him"") Eastwood, have infiltrated a German fortress high atop a craggy mountain, accessible only by cable car. Their mission: discover the identity of a cabal of Nazi spies operating out of London. The two of them, along with three other British agents, are parachuted into the area at night and things, both little and big, begin to go wrong immediately. See ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" for another example. Or -- better yet -- ""The Guns of Navarrone."" Burton is the leader, savvy and quick witted. Clint Eastwood is already a nascent Dirty Harry, the man who kills without passion.<br/><br/>I'm trying not to give away too much of the plot because there are several unexpectable twists in it.<br/><br/>First, though, the photography and setting are truly impressive. Gloomy, filled with foreboding, snow bound. Second, there can be few less likely American killers seconded to a British mission than Clint Eastwood. A Wehrmacht cap simply does not sit well on him. And his acting was to improve over the years. There is a scene in which Burton and Eastwood are frantically trying to escape from the aerie and find themselves trapped in a radio room with alarm bells clanging all over the place as the German soldiers search for them. Burton is doing all he can to reach his base on the radio. Eastwood is keeping a lookout down the hall. Eastwood looks through the doorway and announces, ""We've got company."" His tone is that of a man who's dinner has been interrupted by the doorbell. And the ""company"" is about three dozen machine-pistol wielding avid Nazis -- just about all of whom get slaughtered.<br/><br/>In fact there is a lot of slaughtering in this movie -- all of it suffered by the bad guys. I mean, this is one brutal movie when you come right down to it. Nobody hesitates to shoot a fleeing German woman in the back. And there is a terrific fight on top of the tram that is twirling wildly in mid-air. A boot-in-the-face kind of fight. The deaths of most of the victims is not at all bothersome, since most are as faceless as Dirty Harry's victims. But one handsome young soldier is listening to a sentimental tune on the radio while Eastwood creeps up behind him to slit his throat, and the scene raises hairs on the back of your neck. And when a bad guy takes a half-mile nose dive off the tram, his scream is as agonizing as those of the sailors that King Kong shakes off the tree trunk.<br/><br/>The movie was probably done as it was to satisfy the audience's thirst for a bloody but victorious Allied enterprise, but it is SO realistically violent that it winds up being insinuating. What if the Allies has lost the war? We would all be sitting around watching German or Japanese agents slaughter an equal number of dim-witted Americans and Brits.<br/><br/>However, if your search is for war-time action, this is it. But it's only enjoyable if you keep in mind that it's all a fantasy, like the Rambo movies. Otherwise, you might contract a case of the creeps. Behind the gunsmoke, the movie is a shiver looking for a spine to run up."

","As SS-Standartenführer Kramer says during the movie: Preposterous!

Sure there is plenty of action in it and a couple of great actors (though not here) but there is something about the movie that just didn't grab me. It think it has to be the story line. There are just too many unbelievable elements: from the far fetched plot, to the fact they must have carried about a ton of explosives around, to the innumerable scrapes the good guys just barely get out of. That and I think the characters are too one dimensional.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have compared WED to Guns of Navarrone, but IMO Guns is a far superior movie largely because it doesn't have all the plot twists and because it strikes me as far more believable.

","I'm pulled two ways by this film. I've seen it several times over the course of the last 40 years. Visually it is stunning. The acting is really good, especially from Eastwood and Burton. I have to say though that I enjoyed the book a lot more as it concentrated more specifically on the intrigue rather than cramming in as much killing as possible. As regards the kill count this for me was the first war movie that ran away with the idea of slaughter on a mass scale, of killing and mayhem for its own sake. To this extent it was the forerunner of the Rambo series; even of the recent re-make of 'Ingloureous Basterds'. In the book the Burton character actually saves a young German soldier who is about the get burned - the complete antithesis of the film. A lot of people who have reviewed this film have said that it would be impossible for so many of the enemy to be killed by so few. I disagree. The allied team were professional assassins unlike the Germans most of whom had probably never seen action. Moreover, the Burton and Eastwood characters were dressed in German uniforms which gave them a decided edge (this made it murder in terms of the Geneva convention, by the way!). I also found it difficult to imagine that such a plan as this could have worked, despite the blips that took place, and ended up with the team safely on board the Junker with the plan accomplished. When you think how military intelligence tended to mess up even the most straight-forward of plans, it does make this convoluted scenario seem even more unbelievable. The whole thing snowballed so much that I ended up feeling really sorry for the German blokes - they were only inexperienced servicemen (probably not Nazis) getting shot to bits by a team of professional assassins, not really knowing what had hit them. As I said, even though I thought Eastwood acted really well, his character just got my goat. He really seemed to be enjoying himself. God help me, I ended up hoping he'd get a bullet where it would do him least good and maybe that would wipe that sadistic half-smirk off his face."

","In the late sixties, many people still weren't able to fully cope with the horrors of the Second World War and at the same time they also had to deal with their sons, brothers or men going to Vietnam, fighting and dying for a war they didn't have much to do with in the first place. So the least they wanted to see was a war movie that showed all the horrors, all the blood, the wounded and the dying into every little detail. Still, war has always been a fascinating subject for many people and Hollywood knows that too. All they had to do was to 'invent' a new kind of war movies. That's why they came up with the idea of the more adventurous war movies with some true American silver screen heroes kicking some German ass...<br/><br/>""Where Eagles Dare"" is a fine example of such movies. It tells the story of an American general who has been shot down over enemy territory in a British aircraft in 1944. The Germans keep him prisoner in the nearest SS headquarters, a highly defended and impenetrable castle on top of a mountain in the German Alps. But what the Germans don't know is that the general knows all about the plans for D-Day and before they get the chance to find out, the British secret service will attempt to rescue him with a daring operation. But as soon as the mission unfolds, double and triple agents begin to appear in the ranks of the rescue team. And to make things even more complicated: an American Lieutenant was assigned to the mission, but no-one seems to know why...<br/><br/>I don't want to bee too negative about this film, but the problem is that I'm more a fan of the realistic war movie that shows the war the way it really was. I rather like to see people from both sides die, because that's a lot more like it was in reality. Watching this movie, I couldn't help noticing the fact that those five or six men really were better than Superman himself. Not only were they able to get into the highly defended castle that lay on top of a mountain and with a fully manned army barracks at the base, they were even able to get out of it alive without getting badly wounded. And as if that wasn't even enough, they even find the time to kill about 500 Germans (including a lot of SS troops, which were the best Germany had to offer) and to use so much dynamite that it is almost enough to blow that castle right off that mountain.<br/><br/>Something else that bothered me was the language. When I heard someone in the beginning of the movie say that they all were able to speak German fluently, I hoped to hear people like Clint Eastwood speak German. But what happened? They all kept speaking English, making us believe that it was another language, by adding some other intonation so now and then. OK, I prefer to hear the Germans speak their native language, but if they all have to speak English, so be it. But can someone please explain me then why sometimes the Germans, when they weren't interacting with the main characters did speak German??? There is no logical explanation for that. All it does is to emphasize that the main characters don't speak German but English and that really bothered me. <br/><br/>But not everything about this movie was bad. If you are a fan of the more adventurous type of war movies, than this is definitely worth a watch. It offers plenty of suspense, a lot of twists and more than enough action which will keep the adrenalin pumping from the beginning until the end. And on top of that you even get a cast with some very well-known actors (although there aren't as many famous names in it as in other war movies of that time period). I know I may have been a bit too hard on the makers of this movie. I guess it's a typical product of the sixties and if you watch it like that it certainly isn't bad. That's why I still give it a 6, perhaps a 6.5/10."
"Maziun","8","2","4","7 December 2013"," Epic action/war movie
","Good old Alistair MacLean . I love his books and the movies based on his books are often great too. ""Where Eagles dare"" along with ""The Guns of Navarro"" is the best movie based on his book. It's a simple story about a group of British and one American commandos trying to save American general from the hands of Nazis. The general has important information that can change the fate of whole World War II. His kept in a heavily guarded castle. Of course the story gets complicated I like that ""WED"" feels like a real life instead of typical Hollywood action movie . There are no one-liners , love stories or too much humor ( Ironically, all those elements appears in MacLean book). There story takes itself seriously , but not too seriously. The movie is based on three characters played by Richard Burton , Clint Eastwood and Mary Ure. The others are more or less a fillers. In the end it doesn't real matters , since the plot is interesting and action engaging.<br/><br/>Richard Burton Quito possibly gives the best performance of his life here. He TOTALLY dominates the screen . He's so tough, charming , bad ass that he makes look Eastwood bland . Can you imagine that ? Eastwood is reduced to a supporting player and nobody can't really complain about that . I've never thought I see a movie with Eastwood not being the ultimate bad ass on screen , but here it is ! It doesn't mean that Clint is bad here . He's good as a supporting character and he does get some cool action sequences here too . The movie just doesn't allow him to be as bad ass as in his later movies , but considering how awesome Burton is in this movie I doubt anyone can't complain. Mary Ure is nice as the woman spy.<br/><br/>The movie is long (almost 3 hours) , yet never dull . The movie moves slowly and I can admit that most fun appears after first hour . ""WED"" takes necessary time to set the story and since there is quite a lot plot here the viewer shouldn't be bored pay . From that moment the plot twists and action will amaze the viewer to the end of the movie. The last 45 minutes is non-stop action full of shootouts , fights and chases . The director Brian G. Hutton turns that part of the movie into exciting marathon of violence. What he does here for action movie is what Hitchcock did for thrillers . It's a spectacle , but not in mindless way. ""WED"" is a believable action movie where a group of few people defeats the whole army. The modern action movie directors should take notes how to create great action without tons of money , CGI and quick montage. ""WED"" is a proof that less is more – the scene with Burton fighting for life with two bad guys is better than all those kung fu fights combined together.<br/><br/>I really like the art-direction here – the castle , the village , the camps. The movie is quite nicely photographed by Arthur Ibbefson and the music by Ron Goodwin is subtle , yet very effective . The special effects hold up pretty good considering their age. Unlike most action movies I regret that I haven't seen this one in cinema.<br/><br/>A truly satisfying experience for all action movie fans and not only . I give it 8/10."

On top of that we have some very comic moments when the team members exchange some ingenuous puns.<br/><br/>But this precisely is what makes our movie entertaining. the director doesn't ignore any of these anomalies and by the end of the movie quite convincingly explains each of these absurd looking situations with a tenable theory.<br/><br/>To TOP IT OF WE HAVE A THEATRICAL ENDING WHERE IN AA MOST ELOQUENT WAY Mr. Burton tricks us and the Nazis into his trap.

"Installation_At_Orsk","10","2","4","21 June 2007"," The most entertaining war movie ever!
","It's inaccurate in details, the heroes survive cataclysms with barely a scratch that in the real world would kill them a dozen times over, and the triple-cross on which the entire plot hinges makes the Nazi masterminds seem like drooling three-year-olds in terms of gullibility when you stop and think about it. But who cares, when it's all so much damn *fun*?<br/><br/>Where Eagles Dare is surely the ultimate ""war as big boys' adventure"" film, full of derring-do, narrow escapes, sinister villains and legions of incompetent cannon fodder to be mown down like swastika-sporting weeds. Clint is, of course, Clint - taciturn, deadly and effortlessly cool, but for once he's, if not upstaged, at least matched by another actor in the star wattage stakes. It may not exactly be an acting showcase for Richard Burton, but he still makes the enigmatic Smith completely riveting with his effortless command over everyone he encounters - and there's also a very human moment, completely in keeping with the Boys' Own feel of the story, as he takes a moment to chuckle gleefully at the massive destruction he's just caused.<br/><br/>There are flaws, yes - it's overlong, has some blatant continuity errors and obvious dummies (sometimes in the same shot!) and plot holes abound. But in this case... so what? The film is a romp, plain and simple, there to do nothing more than deliver thrills and spills with great efficiency. Which it does.<br/><br/>One interesting point is that even though Alastair Maclean wrote both the screenplay and the novel, he also knew the different markets well enough to tailor them. In the book, Smith and Schaffer are essentially on a stealth mission, going out of their way to minimise even German casualties. In the film, however, they kill practically every Nazi in a 50 mile radius!"
"philpaulopaulo","9","2","4","7 March 2007"," One of the best war films ever
","I write this in the hopes that hopefully someone, an upcoming director will read this, and maybe make an impression. I want more filmmakers to try and make a chase scene like the one in Where Eagles Dare, the one where the red bus is trying to get away from the Wehrmacht soldiers. Triggering the booby traps and all that. It seems these days most chase scenes are built on speed and effects, which I suppose is a natural progression to keep the mind interested. These guys, way back when they made this film, had none of those tricks, and yet this is one of the most exciting chase sequences ever. If you haven't seen it, it is worth the price of the rental just for that. If not only to see a beautiful woman firing an MP40 machine gun from the back with the steady hand of a seasoned soldier. WED just happens to be one of the rare movies that I can't think about without feeling good inside, like maybe I wished I could have joined the OSS back then. All the good guys make it, all the bad guys die, and the espionage and intrigue is first class with classic theater actors like Richard Burton."

","As far as I can remember, WED always was a favourite, the opening scenes, the twists and the brilliant acting. Burton and Eastwood are perfectly suited Allies. Even the women have an important role; no hopeless females falling and screaming, but a composed resistance operative is just as deadly as the main cast.<br/><br/>There is humour to break the ice and some one-liners which makes you enjoy that scene even more. Even though the story is fictional, you would probably think it would have happened - such is the realism.<br/><br/>You don't know the Gestapo until you met the one in this film, cool and very sneaky, and cold.

He is ably supported by Clint Eastwood as Schaffer and Mary Ure as Mary Ellison; the rest of the cast is pretty solid too. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for an exciting wartime adventure."

","This film adapts to the cinema a story of Alistair MacLean and tells an attack allied to a castle occupied by the Germans, in which an American general was like hostage. Its probably one of the most famous war movie classics, with pleasant touches of adventure and suspense in between. Unlike many other people, I confess I had no major problems with the improbability of the script. It is true that this is a pretty impossible story but that does not make it exciting and incapable of catching our attention until the end. In fact, the twists in the script make everything even more interesting and appealing. Richard Burton is the cast's strongest name at a time when he was still a good actor and it was worth watching a movie where he came in. Clint Eastwood also enters, in a strong character and a record already intense but still far from the great roles that have made him famous. Cinematography is very dark and purposely foggy but this is sometimes a bit bad as it makes the movie frowning and somber at times. There are some special effects well done, especially in the end. In fact, the end of the film was the least I liked because it is too simple, lacks the elaborate care that the film had until then. But despite that, it's a great war movie."
"classicsoncall","8","2","5","25 October 2015"," ""Fear lent them wings as the saying goes.""
","With Richard Burton's film career at a bit of a standstill in the mid-Sixties, he started looking for a property that would jump start things by way of a war time action flick along the lines of ""The Guns of Navarrone"". Going right to the source, he asked Alistair MacLean if he thought he could come up with a script built around him as the principal character, utilizing an American actor and a handful of British performers. MacLean came up with ""Where Eagles Dare"" in six weeks! <br/><br/>Considering that time frame, I'd say MacLean came up with a remarkable winner, though you've got to pay serious attention to the story or you'll wind up confused with all the double crosses. Burton's character Major Smith provided a real head scratcher at one point when he claimed he was really a German general at the Schloss Adler summit, proving that an ability to think on one's feet and successfully lie one's way out of trouble can be a real life saver.<br/><br/>I usually don't get too involved personally in most films, but I'd have to say that the roof top scare where Eastwood's Lieutenant Schaffer barely clawed his way back to safety was pretty tense. As for the action sequences, it was all very much over the top and impossibly fortunate that most everything went against the Nazis. Almost joined at the hip for most of the movie, Smith and Schaffer could do very little wrong on their way to whipping the German war machine. It almost made you feel like the real war could have ended much quicker if it had only been turned over to the screen writers."

Unfortunately, this is no ordinary extraction since the general is being held prisoner in a heavily guarded castle in an extremely mountainous part of Germany. Not only that, but there is also a traitor within the group who is determined to thwart any rescue attempt. At any rate, rather than detail any more of the film and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie has more than its fair share of action and pyrotechnics.

","A movie so truly awful that its ranking in the canon of World War Two blockbusters is impossible to understand.<br/><br/>It's badly lit, the photography is poor, and the direction plodding. The shots of an obviously model castle wouldn't make the grade as a Muppets backdrop. The dialogue is as wooden as Burton's acting, and even by Alastair McLean's risible standards of plotting the scenario is ludicrous. Out of a seven man special operations team not one but three turn out to be German agents, and of course there is another master spy back at base controlling the show. The only believable line in the script comes from the German general who responds to Burton's explanation of what is going on with: ""this is preposterous!"".<br/><br/>Burton could teach Superman a trick or two about special powers. Machine gunned in the hand he merely looks at the blood and mutters: ""damn"". He then proceeds to fight two men simultaneously on the roof of a cable car before a spectacular mid-air leap to another cable car - to which he clings grimly with both hands. His stiff movements make clear he couldn't run across a room to the drinks cabinet, and the running shots (from behind) show an obvious stunt double with a noticeably different physique.<br/><br/>The only entertainment to be had lies in spotting the endless mistakes, continuity errors and nonsense.<br/><br/>When the team parachutes into German and the first fatality occurs, Burton says: ""leave the body, the snow will cover it in a couple of hours."" Yes, you guessed - it isn't snowing.<br/><br/>An auto crash so violent the car is badly smashed and the driver is thrown through the windshield to his death leaves Burton and Eastwood unscathed in their seats, not even winded.<br/><br/>Burton has an original approach to special operations. Hiding in a bush with an armed German approaching, he waits until he's spotted before raising his gun. He watches Eastwood creep towards a German, then waits until an alarm button is hit, setting off sirens all over the castle, before firing the shots he should have done all along. When he sets a booby trap, he does it from the wrong side so he has to step dangerously over the trip wire. The bombs themselves are unique in their operation. The wire pulls out for as many yards as you want - the bomb goes off when it's touched i.e. pulled out further. Think about that one.<br/><br/>Burton and Eastwood carry backpacks of infinite capacity. The sheer volume of dynamite and machine guns they produce from them would fight a fair sized war. The Germans, however, have no dynamite when they need it. Faced with a barred door, they waste valuable time beating it down with hammers. When they do get round to using dynamite it works in mysterious ways. A tree obstructing a road is blasted away with an almighty bang, a blinding flash and clouds of smoke. The smoke clears to reveal no hint of a crater and the snow lying just as before.<br/><br/>The intrepid team plunge from a cable car into an ice cold river. A couple of shots later they're bone dry and there hasn't been a shiver.<br/><br/>If you wonder why Burton and Eastwood greatly complicate their escape by taking the three double agents along instead of killing them - don't ask. It gets them into a mess so they can fight and use more explosives, that's why.<br/><br/>The best howlers come at the end. Burton radios from the castle for a plane to rescue them. In the few minutes it takes to get to the local airfield, the plane has flown from England to Bavaria. The master spy is, naturally, on board for a showdown. Burton explains they've known for months he was a spy - the point of the elaborate incursion into Germany was to be, well, sure. That's an Alastair McLean storyline for you, folks! The spy is then allowed to escape the hangman by leaping from the plane to his death - except, being a Major, it would, of course, have been a firing squad. Even in wartime, you see, Britain is incapable of a secret court martial for a military spy, and the bad publicity would be, well, embarrassing. Like the movie, really.<br/><br/>If you really must watch this stinker when it comes round yet again on TV do so only to marvel that Hollywood ever made it, that Burton was ever regarded as an A list star, and that so many people paid to see it in movie theaters."

While Richard Burton is great, I think that Clint Eastwood's role is a deeper and very understated study as a confused yet loyal American soldier to the English in their mission. This is one of the most intriguing war moves ever made in my humble opinion. The scenery, the plot, the outcome, the twists and turns are what makes a 2 1/2 hour movie a treat to watch over and over again and the time just flies. Without giving anything away, just watch this movie once and you might be a fan for a long time. This movie is one for the ages and to cherish because it never gets old no matter how many times I watch it by myself or with family members."
"MartinHafer","7","2","6","13 March 2017"," A good film but how good seems to diminish with repeated viewing.
","Years ago, I saw ""Where Eagles Dare"" and loved it. Now, quite a few years later, I watched it again and was less impressed. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film but it suffers from two huge problems. First, the plot itself is very convoluted and difficult, at times, to follow. According to IMDb, co-star Clint Eastwood was NOT happy about the script...and I can see why this was most likely the case. Second, the ease at which the two heroes kill off Germans is almost cartoonish. The Germans miss again and again and again and the heroes (Richard Burton and Eastwood) are practically impossible to kill. Bomb blasts narrowly miss them and the worst they incur is a slightly wounded hand that NEVER impairs Burton's character in the least! And, they both manage to kill about 100 well trained German soldiers! It reminded me a bit of ""Hot Shots Part Deux""...and that is NOT meant as a complement.<br/><br/>Now if you can ignore all this, the film is a good escapist war film. Not as good as the same author's ""Guns of Navarone""--where some of the heroes DID manage to die and the same insane ratio of killed isn't quite as bad! Enjoyable and worth seeing...but flawed when you see it twice and realize its shortcomings."
"freemantle_uk","8","2","6","13 June 2009"," An old-fashion action film
","What's not to love about Where Eagles Dare? It is an good old action film which is meant to be fun. A classic for it's type of World War Two genre.<br/><br/>The premise is simple, the Nazis captured General Carnaby, an American General who was on-route to Crete to talk with her generals about the Second-Front. He is held in a German fortress near the Austrian border and MI6 sent a team, led by Major Smith (Richard Burton) and American Lieutenant Schaffer (Clint Eastwood). Their mission is simply, get into the base disguised as German soldiers, get the general and get out. However, the plan is not as simple as they thought. Smith parachute an British agent, Mary (Mary Ure) and that they is more the operation then first appears.<br/><br/>The action is excellent, with great gun and hand-to-hand fights, especially the fight on the cable carts, and Clint Eastwood's use of guns and explosives. It's a simple but enjoyable film and Richard Burton makes a surprisingly good action star. The direction by Brian G. Hutton was brilliant for this type of film and he was able to repeat it with Kelly's Heroes. Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are both excellent actors and are good in this, and so are most of the supporting actors.<br/><br/>The only real problem with the film is with the amount of plot twists, which makes the film unbelievable. It's best not to apply real-world logic to the film.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable romp."
"d858thompson","7","2","6","28 February 2005"," A good movie but a little long
","This movie has several moments to it - unfortunately it has way too many moments - it goes on forever! Fortunately it's interesting and enjoyable. But I think the length is Alistair MacLean's style. I've read some of his other books and for novels of action they're kind of slow paced. But I admire that in a way. It's almost Stanley Kubrick-ish in that he lets the story develop.<br/><br/>So here are the good points and the really good points. Richard Burton - okay, now who decided to put him in an action movie again? He's more convincing when he's doing the acting or throwing off pithy lines. I think they hired Richard Burton because Clint Eastwood, love him as I do, his acting chops weren't quite developed yet when this film was made. He pretty much runs around shooting people and looking menacing.<br/><br/>The scenes at the fortress are the best. The scenes on the tram are incredible. I've probably seen this movie three times and they still have me on the edge of my seat every single time. Pretty much from the tram scenes to the end is great - definitely the better part of the film.<br/><br/>Also, the music is great - thundering almost - although you hear it over every scene. Yes, it's great but it ain't Mozart - could we have one scene without it? Oh, but getting from the start of the movie to when they're getting up to the top of the meeting. Slow. I mean like getting frozen syrup out of the bottle slow or at least that's how I remember it.<br/><br/>So, over all, a good movie. Watch it on a rainy day. Then if you want to see Richard Burton in a really great movie, watch ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf."""
"clanciai","10","1","2","6 March 2020"," Richard Burton doing his best against extremely troublesome odds
","This is not only perhaps the best Alistair MacLean film together with ""The Guns of Navarone"" but also one of the best war films ever made, for its constantly increasing density of action and tension and outstanding palacting by all the actors, especially Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood of course, who actually are each other's opposites but match each other more thasn well anyway. Also the story is one of MacLean's best in its muddled up confusion of treason and double dealings, espionage on the wrong level and booby traps costantly sabotaging the mission, indeed a mission impossible, but surprisingly they carry it through anyway thanks to the inofficial assistance of Mary Ure and even disobeying orders from above. Patrick Wymark is as he always is, he can never play any other character than his own, while the Germans are given too little space to act properly. I saw it 50 years ago, but to watch it again after 50 years was more than rewarding, as I was quite astonished to find it so astoundingly excellent. This is definitely a classic for all times, as it is entirely without any weak spots anywhere in its constantly throbbingly vibrant life and suspense, mainly kept up by superb acting.."
"tim-764-291856","8","1","2","3 April 2012"," The nearest Richard Burton got to being James Bond...
","This must remain one the most reliably comforting bloke's movies, ever! You don't have to think, but you could if you wanted to. Nasty Nazis against nice Richard Burton and exciting Yank Clint Eastwood, all set against the alpine snows of WW2.<br/><br/>I used to enjoy it as a kid, when my Dad watched it, 30 odd years ago. And today, me feeling lousy, it still hits the right spots and pushes the right buttons. More stunts - and exciting and well choreographed ones - than your average Bond and it's action all the way. The one with the snowplough bus and they bring all the telegraph poles down to thwart the pesky enemy on their motorbikes is an all-time great and a highlight of the film. That snow-plough bus then becomes like Steve McQueen on his motorbike in The Great Escape - a very symbol of freedom, possible escape. Will they make it??<br/><br/>Again, the cable car sequences are straight out of a James Bond. Plus the great stereo (we didn't get that on TV 30 years ago) soundtrack by Ron Goodwin, all stirring and loud.<br/><br/>Who cares that there's some embarrassingly obvious looking back- projection and vehicles explode just two seconds after they've been pushed off a cliff and haven't yet bumped into anything, yet alone reached the bottom of the ravine? Well, you might but there's nothing you can do about it, now!<br/><br/>For ultra serious film watchers it's all rather frivolous, of course. There's not an ounce of historical fact, reality is as fleeting as a ghost in a draft but that's what's great about it. It knows all too well what it is and doesn't pretend to be anything other.<br/><br/>Don't watch it again on commercial TV, all cut up with ads in all the wrong places and which bumps it up to 3 hours. Do as I did, 35 years after I first saw it - get the DVD, it's the price of a pint and lasts considerably longer!"

","Where Eagles Dare is a novel by Alistair MacLean a Scottish author who specialized in well-researched, suspenseful war novels. From opening scene to final scene Alistair MacLean's screenplay is a masterpiece of the action genre with a detailed and involving plot that unfolds in a very interesting manner.<br/><br/>Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood are in terrific form as leaders of a mission deep behind enemy lines. The mission for Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood is to infiltrate the most inaccessible castle in the world to rescue an important American general right from under the noses of the Germans. The only way to get into the castle is via a cable car. Dressed as German soldiers, they... well, I had better leave it at that, otherwise I will give the game away. What they and the audience don't suspect is the number of twists and turns this highly thrilling film will take. Also excellent performances from Michael Hordern as British Vice Adm. Rolland and Derren Nesbitt as Nazi Major von Harpen support the performances of Burton and Eastwood.<br/><br/>The cinematography is breathtaking, the snow capped Alps are all around the fortress. The sets are also well made and convincing. The characters are a little shallow, especially the credulity of the Germans, but that is what one would expect in such a far-fetched plot! This movie is about action and adventure! There's also a neat plot twist in store when the commandoes manage to reach the American general -- which leads to yet another twist. The vertigo-inducing climax has made Where Eagles Dare one of the most sought-after of ""early"" Eastwood starring features.<br/><br/>Where Eagles Dare is one of those war films which have a great deal going for it, although falling into some typical traps. Even so, I found it to be entertaining enough to have watched it on a number of occasions.<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences look a little ropey, but generally this is an impressive film of the type they don't make any more, unfortunately."

","I found this to be exciting and enjoyable throughout. I didn't know any of the plot going in, and with a modicum of disbelief suspension (when are those Nazi's going to learn how to shoot straight?) I found it to be very engaging.<br/><br/>Negatives: it definitely got a little long (158 minutes in all), and I felt much of the ""escape"" action was somewhat gratuitous and drawn out. I also thought the supporting cast, with the exception of Darren Nesbitt as von Hapen, were pretty pedestrian.<br/><br/>Positives: good roles for both Burton and Eastwood. I found the taciturn interplay between the two characters very enjoyable. For all its run time, the dialog is quite sparse, which I thought added to both the intensity and the suspense.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought it was an excellent movie."
"bushtony","9","1","2","3 June 2008"," The ultimate Nazi turkey shoot - what's not to like?
","Along with Aldrich's superlative ""The Dirty Dozen"" this is the ultimate boy's own wish-fulfilment Second World War Nazi turkey shoot. And one of coolest war movies of all time. I make no bones here  I love it. <br/><br/>Alistair MacLean's convoluted and twisty original script (he turned it into a novel at pretty much the same time) is designed to shift like an over-fuelled V2 rocket on nitroglicerine steroids. The plot is a vaguely labyrinthine vehicle for the pyrotechnics and mayhem; it drives the action without begging too much thought. <br/><br/>A group of crack Brit paratroops (and one American) are dropped into snow-swept Bavaria to rescue an American General who is being held captive by Fritz in the impenetrable Schlos Adler  reachable only by cable car and helicopter. General Carnaby is, however, a fake  an American actor impersonating the real article. From then on in it gets increasingly more complicated, but, what the hell, who really cares? <br/><br/>The two male leads, sixties movie icons in their own distinct ways, are unlikely bedfellows to say the least - Shakespearean Welsh actor Richard Burton and sardonic, minimalist American anti-hero Clint Eastwood. Yet, the way in which their polar opposite acting styles compliment each other is a rare surprise. Both stars seem to be having a ball, and neither overshadows the other. It makes for intriguing if not compelling viewing. <br/><br/>This film has an almost Biblical disregard for human life and revels in arbitrary death and destruction. The sardonic and self-satisfied laughter of Burton as he and Eastwood blow up half a Bavarian village as a distraction and flee on a motorcycle and sidecar gives a clear hint at the gratuitous lack of conscience. Indeed, Nazis are shot, strangled, stabbed, blown-up, incinerated, hurled through car windscreens, kicked off cable cars, thrown down mountainous drops, etc, with a frivolous sense of cruel glee. Eastwood's special-forces assassin is as blackly humorous as he is cold and lethal. His stock greeting of ""Hello"" just before he shoots someone point blank or machine-guns a stairwell full of Germans somehow (strangely) helps make him a likable character. He kills more people in this film than he has in any other to date. <br/><br/>The dialogue is littered with sharp witticisms and memorable catchphrases: <br/><br/>(After Shaffer/Eastwood has just killed a German with a knife) Smith: ""That was quick."" Shaffer: ""Fear lent him wings, as the saying goes."" <br/><br/>Smith: ""Broadsword calling Danny Boy."" <br/><br/>Mary: ""You're too old for this."" Smith: ""Thank you for those few kind words."" <br/><br/>In the end, though, the aim of the film is to cram as much non-stop action into it's running time as it can and waste as many sons of the Fatherland as possible in the process. <br/><br/>Technically, it is a product of it's time. The back-projection on the cable car scenes is shockingly poor by today's standards, and in many other respects it shows it's age. Also, Eastwood's resolutely sixties hairstyle and cynically hip demeanour places him incongruously in a whole different time frame. <br/><br/>Yet it continues to remain a ripping yarn and a terrific thrill ride with a cracking cast. I've watched it dozens of times over the years and something always seems to draw me back to it. I've seen what are considered to be more ""worthy"" and meaningful war movies a mere once or twice and probably never will again. That's entertainment for you."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** As a child i was obsessed with this film. Completely and totally obsessed. And i haven't forgotten or even lost my love for this fantastic movie, which is about the best film i can rememeber.<br/><br/>(INCLUDES SPOLIERS)<br/><br/>Major Smith (Richard Burton) and his team of commandos, incluing an American, Leitenant Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), are assigned to break into a Bavarian castle during WW2 and spring out a US General who has been captured and incarcerated there. Things seemingly don't go to plan as two team members are murdered, and three more are taken prisoner before the only two remaining members, Burton and Eastwood, are able to gain access to the castle, via a double agent and an either member of the team, brought along secretly.<br/><br/>The American General is interrogated by nazi officers and threatened with drugging if he doesn't reavel Allied plans for the Second Front. He is then introduced to the three captured officers, who are in reality Double Agents whose job it was to ensure that that misson would fail. However, Burton takes over the interrogation by revealing himself to be a double agent, and claiming to his ""fellow german officers,"" and claiming that the three agents are fakes who are attempting to infiltrate the german high command.<br/><br/>
Burton tells the three that the only way they can remove suspicion on their name is to prove to him that they are double agents, and tells them that the way to do this is to each list all their contacts in Britain who are making life for MI6 very difficult. Having taken the lists, Burton then reveals that he is not a double agent at all, and that the three, Thomas, Christian, and Barclay, were telling the truth after all. The meeting is then interrupted by a gestapo Major, but Eastwood kills him along with the Nazi officers, and then takes the traitors prisoner.<br/><br/>The group then ""attempt to create enough confusion to get out alive,"" which somehow they manage to do, figting tooth and nail through the castle, the garrison, inlcuiding a suberb sequence where Burton has to battle two of the traitors on top of a calbecar high above the village. When the group finally make it back to the rescue plane, the MI6 boss there to meet them, Colonel Turner, is revealed to be the Nazi spy kingpin. Burton allows him to commit suicide by throwing himself out of the plane.<br/><br/>In all this is an excellent film which uses great writing, fine acting, a great score, some fabulous locations, and good direction to create perhaps one of the most complete and enteraining WW2 films ever made."

"quarterwavevertical","1","3","12","5 August 2018"," An Absolute Stinker
","I first saw this movie when it was shown in my high school about 2 or 3 years after it was released. I wasn't impressed with it back then. I watched it again this weekend and my opinion of it is even lower now.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie is full of technical inaccuracies. The Germans had helicopters that wouldn't appear until the late 1950s/early '60s? Really? (Wouldn't landing a chopper in such a small courtyard be considered dangerous, even for military pilots? Being a metre or so off in any direction would mean that the rotors would clip the stonework, resulting in a mishap.)<br/><br/>The use of the radios was also laughable. The size of the rig that the group took with them was what we hams would call a boat anchor because it's large, bulky, and heavy. (Transistors wouldn't be invented until the late 1940s.) Because it's supposed to be a covert mission, wouldn't something smaller and lighter have been more appropriate? From my understanding of what was used for such purposes during WW II, the radio should have only been capable of sending Morse code. There wouldn't have been the need for any of the circuitry required for voice transmissions.<br/><br/>Then, because it was supposed to be a covert mission, why was Richard Burton's character transmitting in the clear? Shouldn't he have used code words to disguise the content and purpose of the transmission? That in itself would be another reason to used a Morse code rig as it would have been easy to encrypt the message by using a cipher. Besides, using encryption would add to the mystery of the mission for the viewers. On top of that, Morse code transmissions would have had a better chance of being received in England.<br/><br/>I guess Alistair MacLean, as well as the movie's producers, probably thought that the audience would be too dumb to figure that out.<br/><br/>The plot itself is full of holes. For example, since when does a covert operations team deploy only hours after, apparently, being assembled for the first time? Nobody seemed to know who anybody else was, which would hardly be conducive to the group's effectiveness.<br/><br/>Of course, all those crack German troops that were stationed near the castle couldn't hit the broad side of a barn whenever they were shooting. All of their motor vehicles exploded and burned instantly at even the sound of gunfire and the drivers seem to find every bump, pothole, and obstacle even in broad daylight.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I'm sure you get the picture.<br/><br/>I read a number of MacLean's novels while I was in junior high and I thought he was a pretty good author. But it was around the time that this movie was made that the quality of his writing, in my opinion, started declining. He started by telling some good stories but eventually they became predictable potboilers. Change some names and settings, and one could easily figure out how it was going to end. I gave up after I read ""Bear Island"", which I thought was rubbish.<br/><br/>Avoid ""Where Eagles Dare"", but, if you want to see a good movie in which Richard Burton plays a spy, watch ""The Spy Who Came In From The Cold"", which was made a few years earlier. It's a good story and has lots of plot twists to keep you guessing."
"Leofwine_draca","10","2","7","20 June 2016"," Fantastic WW2 adventure
","I think WHERE EAGLES DARE is a tremendously exciting, action-packed WW2 adventure and certainly the best adaptation of a novel by Alistair MacLean that I've watched. My only complaint is that it's taken me until the thirty-fifth year of my life to actually bother sitting down and watching it, which is almost criminal. In any case, this is a classic war film that can be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of THE GREAT ESCAPE. It features an all-star cast of heroes doing heroic things in a film which has a bit of everything: suspense that never lets up from beginning to end, huge action in the form of countless shoot-outs, sinister Nazi villains, beautiful women, and rugged male heroes.<br/><br/>Richard Burton is the erstwhile lead, doing unsurprisingly well with a multi-layered character, and Clint Eastwood is the perfect choice for his young, cocksure, American partner. The setting itself - this was filmed in the Bavarian Alps - is beautifully shot and a fine addition to the movie. I find the idea of infiltrating a Nazi mountaintop fortress to be incredible in itself and WHERE EAGLES DARE runs away with the premise. In the second half, there's as much action as in COMMANDO, it gets so thrilling.<br/><br/>Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt in particular make their mark as the femme fatales caught up in the action. Other reliables like Donald Houston, Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern, and a superbly slimy Derren Nesbitt really make their mark, and Anton Diffring plays one of his most memorable Nazi characters. There are some stunning set-pieces here, but the latter bit on the cable car is by far the best moment of the film. I just can't get over how fresh and modern-feeling WHERE EAGLES DARE, and how much entertainment it packs into that lengthy running time. It's a classic!"
"Bob-45","6","3","14","16 February 2001"," Lots of Action  So Why is it so Tedious?
","In 1969, Richard Burton was, if not at the height of his career, at least near it.  Clint Eastwood had become America's number one action star. Alistair MacLean was second only to Ian Fleming in writing action-adventure/spy dramas.  His THE GUNS OF NAVARONE had virtually created the film genre and his ICE STATION ZEBRA confounded both the critics and the studio by actually making money after being written off. So, it is understandable that WHERE EAGLES DARE was MGM's most highly anticipated `entertainment' of 1969.  That is, until a ill-conceived ad campaign purporting it as a `spy spoof' resulte in half empty theatres during its first few weeks.  Fortunately for MGM, most first run theatre owners had committed to a certain number of weeks in advance, enabling MGM to revise the ad campaign, and WHERE EAGLES DARE became one of the years big moneymakers.  Not that it deserved it.  MacLean novels are a great read, but they generally translate badly to the screen.  Characterization is not one of MacLean's strong suits, to put it politely.  In order to examine why EAGLES is not the great film GUNS is, one must remember that MacLean did NOT write the screenplay to GUNS.  Veteran writer / producer Carl Foreman did, and Foreman imbued  the characters in GUNS with complexity and tremendous personal conflicts.  One has to care about characters in order to care what happens in a movie.   This is virtually impossible in EAGLES, because the `heroes' as so one-dimensional as to be interchangeable with the `villians.' This is especially a problem with everyone wearing the same uniforms and speaking the same language with the same accents.  Only Darren Nesbitt (who?) makes much of an impression as the efficiently creepy Gestapo Major Von Hapen.<br/><br/>Despite the `thrills' and `chills,'  I found WHERE EAGLES DARE to be about as exciting as watching paint dry.  However, in fairness to the movie, I would like to correct a misconception regarding the `anachronism' of using a helicopter to reach `Eagles Nest.'  The film helicopter like the ones we know of today flew in 1939 in Germany (naturally).  The only quibble I would have is that neither Burton nor Eastwood seemed surprised by it."

Richard Burton may have been a great theater actor, but as a film actor he always seems to be trying to do a soliquey. Here, the years of hard living are plainly clear. He is totally unconvinging as an elite paratrooper. Even Eastwood would comment later, that the stuntmen had a field day because they worked a lot of overtime!"
"Wuchakk","10","2","8","15 March 2014"," One of the greatest action/adventure films ever made
","RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, ""Where Eagles Dare"" is a World War II adventure about handful of commandos parachuting into the wilderness surrounding a German castle-fortress high in the Bavarian Alps. Their mission is to rescue a captive general before the Germans can interrogate him. However, not everything is as it first appears.<br/><br/>The film is not a conventional World War II flick. Alistair Maclean wrote the script based on his novel and thus the movie is, unsurprisingly, a spy thriller just as much as it is a war picture. Keep in mind that spy flicks were super-hot when the film was released (e.g. James Bond). Are 60's spy films plausible? Realistic? No, they only have the veneer of plausibility and realism; underneath it's all escapist fantasy. So it is with ""Where Eagles Dare.""<br/><br/>The opening with the breathtaking Alps and Ron Goodwin's exhilerating score is one of the greatest cinematic openings in history. From there you get intrigue, thrilling action scenes, a magnificent castle, Richard Burton at his charismatic best, two beautiful women (Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt), surprising plot twists, cable cars, a suspenseful escape and a don't-see-it-coming ending, not to mention Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>Speaking of Eastwood, he plays a taciturn American lieutenant, second fiddle to Richard Burton, the British leader of the operation. Believe it or not, Burton's charisma is so out of the ball park that Eastwood pales by comparison. Of course, this has a lot to do with the way their roles were written, but you still have to give Burton credit for blowing Eastwood, who's no slouch, out of the water.<br/><br/>Some complain about the utter ruthlessness of the Allied commandos, particularly the characters played by Burton and Eastwood, but they're Special Forces on a secret mission, not conventional soldiers in infantry combat. They're professional killing machines, which is why they were given the job. There was no room for mercy in this operation at this stage in the war.<br/><br/>In any case, it's exciting to see Burton & Eastwood and their team mow down scores of Germans. The film's so well-done and compelling that you sorta don't realize how unbelievable it is while watching. This is because it lacks the cartoonish-ness of, say, ""Rambo 2"" and ""Rambo 3"" and maintains an air of realism throughout (which is different than saying it's realistic).<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: ""Where Eagles Dare"" is one of the greatest action/adventure films of all time and is as-good-or-better than any war flick you care to name. The exhilarating score itself is worth the price of admission, as is the opening. If you're in the mood for a World War II flick, ""Where Eagles Dare"" is at the top of the list.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 35 minutes and was shot on location in Austria with studio work done in England.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

The other actors were also not bad, but no memorable performance for me.<br/><br/>The plot is thrilling, has lots of unexpected turns and the end is surprising as well. Luckily, the movie is in color, enabling to see the nuances of beautiful Austrian landscape and a stunning castle.

","If you have not seen this film you are in for a treat. Do not watch it believing you can sit back as it is just an adventure film. You have to pay attention to fully enjoy the sub plots. The plot is a group of men trying to release an American General held captive in a German castle. The General knows the Allies war plans so has to be freed before the Germans make him talk. Like all films it is easy to pick holes, most probably the biggest hole is at the mission briefing at the very start of the film. A character suggests bombing the castle to stop the General talking. That would be the logical response to the situation but if they did that there wouldn't be a film! So as with all films you have to give it a bit of slack. In summary it is a great film that I have watched many times."

Richard Burton gave an award-winning performance as Major Jonathan Smith, the leader of the rescue drop. Clint Eastwood did a fine job portraying Lt.

Mary Urie nicely portrayed Mary Elison, Smith's tag-along friend who plays a big part in their mission.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were a little odd but overall excellent.

","This reminds me as above, playing it in the streets before the PC brigade can ban it or have it cut on the TV. Eastwood's excellent as the laconic, unwilling Ranger Battalion gun-toting dynamite-tossing soldier and with his chum the ever-so refined older heartthrob Burton casually cutting his way through every situation. The cable car scene may seem a bit old-hat compared to later movies, but it's still well-done and there's some fine backup from Anton Diffring, the excellently creepy Derren Nesbit, Donald Houston, and Mary Ure. Nice to see Ingrid Pitt departing temporarily from her usual blood-sucking roles in the Hammer films also. <br/><br/>We're all ecstatic as Nesbit deservedly cops a good one in the head especially as his annoying trait other than being an SS (Gestapo?) nit is slime-ily chatting up Mary 'I seem to remember, ze cazzedral vas on ze ozzer side of ze square' etc. Plenty of intrigue added too, with the US 'General Carnaby' being rescued coupled with an underlying plot of infiltrating the traitors amongst MI5 etc. The machine-gunning from the back of the bus is a bit special, too as is plenty of delayed-action dynamite. (In the bus scene especially, it's always amazing how the bad guys are always the worst shots!). Mr Eastwood DOES actually put a new clip on! <br/><br/>My favourite scene is Eastwood standing at the top of the stairs in the Schloss Adler, the Nazis running up towards him, pausing for a second (Probably thinking along the lines of:) 'is that er...um... er... he's aiming a gun at us' and Eastwood lets rip on them. He handles two machine guns very good as well by the way. One annoying thing, is, when you imagine yourself among this blood-fest is where Burton, after exposing the three British traitors, takes them with him, roped up. I'd have shot them, but that may be because they're some sort of insurance, I don't know. They happily get the chop anyway. You get your money's worth with this (Or licence fee's worth as it's always on the BBC and on TCM).<br/><br/>There WAS mention on UK Channel Four's '100 Greatest War Movies' (Can't remember offhand what number it checked in at) that Burton and Eastwood despatched about 86 Nazis in it. Add a thousand to that I reckon.<br/><br/>Great stuff and always nice to see so many Nazis deservedly destroyed in spectacular fashion! The almost anti-climax-like ending where Burton exposes the wretched Colonel Turner is a nice icing-on-the-cake end to the action and they all lived happily ever after. Shame about Schaffer's (Eastwood's) comment on keeping it an 'all-British operation next time', WED 2 could have been an nice D-Day exploit!"

There are several scenes in the film in which the heroes, Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton, are able to dodge every single bullet from the enemy and every shot they took would hit a bad guy. But this does not make it a bad film, and it entertains throughout.  Theres plenty of shootouts, chases, explosions, and cliffhanger situations that make it good.

Women probably won't like this but this movie comes from a long gone era in which Hollywood made simple action films without too much swearing and gruesome violence but still had great excitement from start to finish. Plus it has young Clint Eastwood doing that really great quiet, tough guy bit. Richard Burton is good too and some say that his character in the Maclean novel was the basis for James Bond. Eastwood and Burton make a great team and this might be the first modern buddy action film. Although Burton I felt was supposed to be the star of the film Eastwood somehow quietly stole the show as a believable cold-hearted killing machine. A great film worthy of being on the top 250. Sure the plot is a bit<br/><br/>unrealistic but it is still great fun.<br/><br/>Rating- 3.5/4<br/><br/>If you liked this film you would also enjoy THE GUNS OF NAVARONE which is also adopted from a Alistar Maclean novel and is also a good film with an all-star cast."

","""Where Eagles Dare"" is an invigorating wartime (in this case WWII) action-espionage-thriller, extremely well directed (by Brian G. Hutton) and engagingly acted. It's very long, but very absorbing. Even at two hours and 36 minutes, it's never boring. The story, as concocted by Alistair MacLean, has got some delicious twists going for it, and it holds your attention from beginning to end. The characters are fun to watch, heroes and villains alike. And there's a fair bit of violence and TONS of explosions to add to its energy level.<br/><br/>The set-up is intriguing. A military operation is underway as a team of British commandos (with American Ranger Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) along for the ride) attempt to infiltrate a Nazi stronghold which is high in the mountains. Their mission is to liberate an American general (Robert Beatty) who's been taken prisoner. At least, that would SEEM to be the case...<br/><br/>Richard Burton is excellent in the lead role of the unflappable leader of the mission, Major Smith. As things go on, he's required to give a performance within the performance, so to speak, and does a commanding job. Eastwoods' role is to largely react to what's going on around him. His consternation is understandable. The rest of the cast does equally praiseworthy work: lovely ladies Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt, Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern, Donald Houston, Anton Diffring, Ferdy Mayne, and Derren Nesbitt.<br/><br/>Thanks to the capable second unit direction by Yakima Canutt, the action is first rate and the film really does leave you breathless at times. There are some absolutely convincing and hair-raising set pieces, especially on the sky trams going up and down the mountain. And even when a team of characters is making their escape, it's expectedly no easy task, and the enemy keeps the pressure on constantly. Finally, MacLeans' script has one last wonderful twist to sneak in before things are brought to a close.<br/><br/>Accompanied by majestic music composed by Ron Goodwin, this really is top notch screen entertainment.<br/><br/>Nine out of 10. ."

It's an action-packed thriller that has a high-profile cast and despite the pretty long length, hard to stop watching. Sure some scenes were overlong, but I can guarantee with all the action here, this film is far from a bore.<br/><br/>Brian G. Hutton's film takes place in a Nazi castle in the mountains of Austria. Some Allied agents land by the castle so they can rescue a captured American general, but there is more than what meets the eye when it comes to this mission.<br/><br/>There are several brand-name actors here and who would have thought we would see Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood star opposite each other. But alas, they do here and both do a fine job. They have great chemistry with each other and they're just fun to watch. It's always nice to see Eastwood in his younger, esteemed film roles.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a spectacular, action-packed World War Two thriller. It's best to suspend rationalism for this film like most others, because this film is only what I would like to call a ""fantasy war film."" There are elements of reality here, but not enough to justify the term realistic. But hey, this film is very entertaining and I was satisfied with the action. I rate this film 9/10."

If Peckinpah had made this, it would still be as illogical, but there would have been a greater sense of style.  The final result is one part The Eagle Has Landed and two parts Wolfenstein 3D, add in the intelligence level of Con Air and voila!  That's all, folks!  Rambo II is more honest than this.<br/><br/>The sound and cinematography also suffer.  Since I revisited The Wild Bunch, Bonnie & Clyde, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can state that there is no excuse for such a lack of attention to detail.  The creators could not have made a less-involving movie if they tried.  The producers must have cringed when they previewed this out of its sheer stupidity.  I first saw this when I was nine and laughed at its ridiculousness, now I cringe at its sloppiness.  This lacks more credibility and logic than Kelly's Heroes. <br/><br/>

"RossRivero99","10","1","5","22 June 2017"," One of the best WWII movies of all time
","""Where Eagles Dare"" isn't only one of the best WWII movies of all time it is also one of the most entertaining, and in addition it also the best adaptation I've seen of Alistair MacLean's work since ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961). At the time this movie was in production Richard Burton's career was in a downward spiral due to the box office failure of many films including ""Doctor Faustus"" (1967) and ""The Comedians"" (1967) (of which these two films he did with then wife Elizabeth Taylor). So Burton badly needed a hit and even though he didn't like war movies he did this because he wanted to revitalize his film career by doing an action movie in close coordination with MacLean and producer Eliot Kastner. Thus the movie was made and Burton got his box office hit. Burton plays the title role of British army Major John Smith who is in charge of a mission to go to the Nazi ""Castle of the Eagle"" dressed up as Nazis in order to rescue an American General (Robert Beatty) who is held prisoner, while dressing up as Nazis. The person on the team that Smith trusts the most is an American army Lieutenant named Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) who is totally confused as to why he is involved with the mission, the rest of the team consists of Brits and is allied with two women Mary Ellison (Mary Ure) and a woman named Heidi (Ingrid Pitt) who pose as Germans in order to infiltrate the castle. The movie was directed by Brian G. Hutton who would direct Eastwood again in ""Kelly's Heroes"" (1970) two years after this movie was released. Burton and Eastwood give one of their best performances of their respective careers, and MacLean's screenplay really kept me in suspense as well as shock with the amount of major plot twists which are too important for me to spoil in this review. The movie does have echoes of other World War II classics such as ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961), ""The Great Escape"" (1963), and ""The Heroes of Telemark"" (1965), and like those films this one was truly Oscar level thanks to Hutton's expert direction made this movie the masterpiece that it truly is. This is one of 1968's finest films."

But this is only what we think is going on. As the film progresses we learn the real mission is something much different. The reason this film works is how it follows Major Smith and Lieutenant Schaffer on their mission. The best part in the movie is the incredible getaway scene, when the Germans realize who Major Smith and Lieutenant Schaffer are and they make an incredible and daring escape.

Thanks to the writer Alistair MacLean who wrote the screenplay and to Brian Hutton, the director. I sincerely believe that the screenplay writer should have been present each day of the shoot to monitor that his work is being visualized as he thought of. With the writers presence it's very tough to encapsulate the story of such magnitude and present it in such a great form.<br/><br/>The starting music, the shot of the flight, just built up a tension that never let me free till the very end. I am not sure if this was an edge of seat thriller, but for me it was , because I was on the edge just waiting in wonderment, what would happen next when I first saw this many many years ago. <br/><br/>Richard Burton as Major John Smith seems to be a master in holding himself in cold blood as he diligently plans the whole plot. While Clint Eastwood as Lt. Morris Schaffer seems to be action hero who executes the plans to precision and yields results against all the odds. Yes, there are certain cinematic liberties taken in building up the drama but that's good as long as they are meant to entertain and enhance the purpose of the film. <br/><br/>In 1968, this film might have been made with exorbitant budget. I say this, considering the production values, the cinematography, the sound mixing and even the costumes. But, all is well as it paid off handsomely and the big take away is that it's worth investing in something that has content as the soul. So much money poured in to this meaningful script yielded worthy results.<br/><br/>I cannot reveal the plot or even say what it is about, as I have not done for most of my films. But I can say this, if you are lover of some good suspense and drama. Then this film shall be worth your time. A definite 5/5 for this one. This one deserves a watch more than once. Also, I strongly believe this shall stand the test of time as it stood till now and keeps increasing its fan-base."
"neil-476","7","1","5","5 July 2011"," Good but dated
","Richard Burton is the headline attraction, with Clint Eastwood playing second fiddle, in this adaptation of Alistair Maclean's Where Eagles Dare.<br/><br/>The story is of a secret wartime mission behind enemy lines, to a fortress stronghold accessible only by cable car. The plot hardly matters: it is simply a hook to hang several set pieces on. They are the ascent, the fighting within the stronghold, the descent, and the chase back to the airfield to escape. All the set pieces work well, though the final chase works best because it features physical stunts and effects and thus looks real. The shenanigans on the cable car didn't really convince at the time, and certainly don't convince now. And the fight in the château is the same as any other dime-a-dozen shootout.<br/><br/>If you watch this, you get some idea why Burton headed the cast: even though this is effectively a popcorn romp he is a heavy presence and commands respect. You can almost feel Eastwood deferring to him (as an actor).<br/><br/>This is still an entertaining watch even though it is now showing its age a bit."

","Many people had told me that this is one of the best classic war films ever made, and certainly is one of the most exciting classics, from director Brian G. Hutton (Kelly's Heroes). Set in World War II, a British aircraft is shot down and crashes in Nazi territory, an American General, the only survivor, is captured, and he has full knowledge of D-Day. The British decide to try and rescue him so that he does not talk, led by Maj. Jonathan Smith, MC (Richard Burton), along with American Ranger Lt. Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood), which confuses him (being involved with the British). Parachuting to the snowy ground, one of the soldiers is killed, what looks like purposely, so there is much more than just a rescue mission. The most exciting scenes are those in the German mountain castle where Smith and Schaffer along with the other good guys are trying to escape with hostages, but are ending up running into many Nazis, having to set bombs, and stealing cable cars and buses, till eventually they get to the plane. Oh, and they also find out one of their allies is actually a bad guy, and he jumped out the plane to commit suicide. Also starring Mary Ure as Mary Ellison, Michael Hordern as Adm. Rolland; Patrick Wymark as Col. Wyatt Turner, DSO MC, Robert Beatty as Gen. George Carnaby, Anton Diffring as SS-Standartenführer Kramer, Donald Houston as Capt. James Christiansen, Ferdy Mayne as Gen. Rosemeyer, Ingrid Pitt as Heidi, Peter Barkworth as Edward Berkeley, William Squire as Capt. Philip Thomas, Brook Williams as Sgt. Harrod, Derren Nesbitt as SS-Sturmbannführer Von Hapen, Neil McCarthy as Sgt. Jock MacPherson, Vincent Ball as Carpenter and Victor Beaumont as Col. Weissner. This is one of those essential classics with the most exciting from the middle to the end, a great performance from Eastwood, and almost a James Bond type feel to it, a lot of fun!

","This film is a typical contrived and predictable action film based upon an implausible premise. This in itself is OK, because most action films are like this. This one is packed full of explosions and gunfire, is well filmed with some spectacular settings allowed by a big budget. If you like to see the bad guys get their 'come-uppence' then you will enjoy a ludicrously high body count too. Yet to me it comes across as an expensive flop. The film would have worked if it were tongue in cheek. Instead the director adapts a serious approach, which makes the whole thing almost unintentionally comical, especially a group of middle-aged British film stalwarts like Donald Houston and the rotund, alcohol fuelled Richard Burton are supposed to be a team of crack British troops! The direction is also too weak, allowing Burton, et all to ham it up throughout like a group of old theatre 'luvvies'. As for Clint Eastwood you're not sure he is trying to act cool or is merely portraying his very limited range as an actor. The bad guys are not menacing or effective enough, and are too easily disposed off. This means there is no tension to the proceedings - In all confrontations you know who is going to win (the solely one-way fight on the cable car is a prime example of this). It makes you wish for a 'fast forward' to skip to the next scene. Despite this I know lots of people who enjoyed the film but for me it was a hollow, expensive piece of tosh which was trying to be something else."

It's not difficult to imagine the talks Burton had with his agent/Production company: 'It's your mission, Richard, should you choose to accept, to take this piece of crap and elevate it to Mont Blanc status using nothing but your magnificent voice and outstanding acting ability'. Accept he did, and carry out his mission successfully he did in spades. Nuff said."

"sol1218","7","0","3","2 March 2007"," Mutt & Jeff goes to war
","***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Heart-pounding war action adventure with an assault on an impregnable mountain fortress by a squad of hand picked top British commandos, with a US Army Ranger thrown in for good measures. The assault is a rescue attempt of a captured US Army general who's one of the top men in Gen. Eisenhowers high command in the planning of opening up a second front in Western Europe. It turns out that the rescue team is actually infiltrated by a number of German Agents who are on to what the British/USA rescue team are up to. The German Agents turn out to be so stupid or incompetent that they help, more then hurt, the rescue operation from being exposed and taken out by an elite division, the Alpine, of hardened German SS troopers who happen to be the best mountain fighters in the world.<br/><br/>Lead by British Major Jon Smith, Richard Burton, the commandos penetrate the impregnable Nazi fortress the Scholoss Alder, high up in the Bavarian Alps, as easily as you would go down and penetrate your local bar, by just walking through the front door, to buy yourself a drink even with more then half of the British commandos being Nazi Agents! The non -stop action has both Smith and his US Ranger compatriot Let. Morris Schaffer played by a very confused and bewildered looking Clint Eastwood take on and wipe out almost the entire Nazi Alpine Division, as well as a squadron of the Luftawaffe. They do all this without as much as even having to get re-supplied with ammunition and explosives, which they seem to have an unlimited supply of, by an RAF/USAAF air drop.<br/><br/>Joined by pretty British Agent Mary Elison, Mary Ure, Smith and Schaffer make a shamble of the German Army who are even more buffoonish then they were portrayed to be in the darkest days of WWII in movies released by Hollywood in order to drum up moral at home and in the war zone. If the rescue of Gen. Carnaby wasn't hard enough it turns out that Smith is involved in a number of dealings with the Nazi's where he's as much as a a triple or even quadruple agent for both the British and German governments. All that leaves his comrade Let. Schaffer in such a state of confusion that he at one point out of sheer frustration almost killed him in order to make sure that Smith won't, which he did in the movie a number of times, double-cross him.<br/><br/>The hot and heavy action has the Germans use up thousands upon thousands of rounds of ammunition, small arms and artillery, on the three allied commandos, Smith Schaffer & Elison, and only scoring with a minor flesh wound on one of them, Smith's hand, for all their efforts. The way that the commandos dispatch the hapless and ineffective German troops actually makes the audience feel some sympathy for them in that their so outmatched that to cheer for the good guy UK/USA commandos over the bad guy Nazi German troops would be like cheering for a pit-bull to beat chihuahua in a dog fight.<br/><br/>Taking out more Germans, or Japaneses, then John Wayne could have ever dreamed of doing in all of his WWII action movies combined the trio then make a run for it to the nearest German Luftawffe airfield. Then again as easy as shooting fish in a barrel the dynamic and indestructible trio, Dick Clint & Mary, take out the helpless German troops without as much as breaking out into a sweat as they blow up a string of Nazi fighter planes and are then rescued by the British who land and take off almost unopposed and ferry them out. It's then that we find out, with the exception of Maj Smith who was on to him from day one, ***SPOILER*** that the entire operation was sabotaged by one of the top British MI6 intelligence officers who planned it!<br/><br/>You have to suspend belief and logic to enjoy ""Where Eagels Dare"" which doesn't at all, how could it!, seem to take itself really seriously in it's treatment of the evil Nazis. The movie has the Nazis look more like a German version of the Three, or in this case three thousand, Stooges then the ruthless and effective sh*t-kickers that they really were."

A wild, bullet ridden, dynamite ride with breathtaking location shots of the Austrian alps and over 2 1/2 hours of non-stop action filled with double and triple agents and enough implausible sequences to make you smile and gasp all at the same time.

","Well after seeing it on the History channel I must say this is an incredible movie so far ahead of its time. Watching it I get nostalgic about the Second World War. This movie is like Saving Private Ryan without the emotional parts, it captures the adrenaline of the soldiers of the Second World War and even though it has many factual errors it can be forgiven because it does a great job of still feeling like it's a historical re-enactment of an operation during WW2 when in fact its fiction. The only down-side to me was the appearance of a late 1950's chopper, pictured in this movie as a new Nazi invention, other than that one factual error I am in love with this film, also note that Clint Eastwood kills more bad, Nazi, guys in this film than any other film he's ever been in. That has to make you want to see this movie, what other reason would you have, right?"
"sa26steph","Null","0","2","12 June 2003"," Yes, I watched it again, but this time all the way through!
","Despite the fact that this film used to be shown on a 'free' movie channel called TNT almost every other night, this is the first time I have actually watched it from title to end credits. Over the years I have seen the whole film but never in one go!<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought I would give it it's usual cursory glance when I happened upon it the other night on C5.  Now I know it has it's flaws but what the hell, who really cares.  Yes it's far-fetched and we could go on forever (as one reviewer recently did) about the continuity mistakes but who wants reality all the time.  I admit to having a laugh at the rope climbing by messers Burton, Eastwood et al; the rope being no thicker than a rather thick bootlace yet they managed to climb up and down it, in and out of the 'schloss' window without a blister or a care for the 3 mile fall.  A dummy did fall at one point or maybe that was supposed to be one of the characters but I don't think so and some of the 'Germans' must have been recruited from the Octogenarian Extras Company - Oh no I've started criticising this film.<br/><br/>All I want to say is that despite all it's failings I like this film and will doubtless watch it (or part thereof) again at some point in the future. Any film with Ingrid Pitt is worth a look and I do have a liking for Derren Nesbitt; one of these cult British villains who I recall in a Dick Emery film (I'll collect my anorak on the way out).<br/><br/>P.S. It's about time The Guns of Navarone received more airings on TV"

","I didn't see any warning buzzards, maybe they were circling a dead body, but the Klaxons were noisy. No they are not friends of those Saxons. Seriously, I agree with the other reviewer the film has all the elements for a good movie. Fans of WWII games like Wolfenstein, Medial of Honor, and Battlefield 1942 and the fans of WWII movies alike will enjoy it. Clint Eastwood and Richard Burton both do a great job. The sets, music, and special effects are good considering it was made in 1968. The scenery is great and the story moves along even though the movie is not short. Well worth owning on DVD when it comes out."
"Juventude","10","0","2","27 January 2003"," Out-of-time helicopter and astonishing scenery!
","Richard Burton makes an excellent performance in this classic WWII movie for boys. By his side Clint Eastwood continues his character ""The Man With No Name"" from his previous Western-classics ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" (1964), ""For A Few Dollars More"" (1965) and ""The Good, The Bad & The Ugly"" (1966), a role that is more associated with Clint Eastwood than any other character in movie history (perhaps overlooking JR in ""Dallas"").<br/><br/>What I find most astonishing with this movie is the scenery of the winter landscape and the directness of the story. The team operates with a remarkable focus on its objectives, which to me is something quite unusual in movies these days, and something I find more to an advantage when it comes to realism and objectivity. Thus I truly recommend you to see this combination of war- and ""secret agent""-movie.<br/><br/>Please note the german helicopter halfway into the movie, an object totally out of place in the historical environment!"

","Richard Burton at his menacing moody best is ably supported by Clint Eastwood as the silent assassin in this wartime rescue movie. A slightly implausible plot is shadowed by so many twists and turns, it is compelling stuff. Quick-talking Burton thinks his way through the whole movie, and the manner in which Clint ambles through the story, despite all the danger only adds to the suspense. Some cracking cinematography, and a great soundtrack complete the picture. Hard to believe this film was made in 1969 !!!"

","Younger viewers might be put off by the apparent ""hokiness"" of the sets, the acting, the script, and the overall implausibility of it all, but this is wonderful escapist fare, especially when viewed within the context of the rapidly deteriorating James Bond series, to say nothing of the annoying ""cute"" films that dominated the 60's.  (See my review of ""Cat Ballou,"" for an explanation.)  This movie signaled the viewing public that Hollywood was going to try a little harder in the next decade.<br/><br/>Where Eagles Dare is pure entertainment, no more an no less, and it does not aspire to anything higher.  But, it is not predictable.  There is a plot twist at every opportunity and the script, while certainly not Shakespeare, requires careful listening.<br/><br/>The movie is a reminder that Richard Burton used to be young and vigorous, and the part was actually something of a breakout role for him, after having been stuck in all of those awful films with Elizabeth Taylor for most of the 60's.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy this engaging World War II thriller."

","One of my all time favourite war films. OK the good guys seem to be able to beat hundreds of bad guys, but the film is not meant as a true-life depiction of war events. Great opening shots of flying through the mountains ( which were VERY impressive on the big screen ). Some of the miniature/superimposed work was somewhat below standard but overall the film looks great. Action excitement and plenty of plot twists makes this a great ride. Richard Burton ( in my opinion one of the worlds greatest actors ) teams up with perfectly cast Clint Eastwood aided by a terrific supporting cast do a fine job. This was a 'big' film even in it's day , and one which would be too expensive to make now.<br/><br/>Shot in 70mm it needs a big screen to fully appreciate it.<br/><br/>Note some plot/dialogue similarities to another MacLean creation 'The guns of Navarone'.
