"barnabyrudge","Null","90","101","17 September 2003"," An absorbing, well made gangster movie.
","Mike Newell is the weirdest choice for director of a Mafia drama, but he actually makes a terrific fist of it, delivering one of the very best gangster movies ever made. Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are all in top form in front of the camera, too.<br/><br/>Depp plays undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone in this intriguing true story. Pistone is trying to infiltrate his way into a mob family in order to gather evidence against them. He assumes the identity of ""Donnie Brasco"" and slowly but surely earns the love and trust of an old-pro hit-man named Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino). As the months go by, Pistone's marriage begins to fall apart as he is away from his wife (Heche) pretty much all the time. The line between his real life and his undercover life blurs together and he finds himself dangerously close to being seduced by the violent Mob lifestyle.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is an extraordinary film in many ways. As already mentioned, the performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured; the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic; the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's such a powerful picture, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking yourself what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. Very few movies genuinely inspire you to debate the whats, whys and wherefores of the main character and his actions... but with Donnie Brasco, that's just what you'll find yourself doing."
"rbverhoef","8","112","129","17 September 2004"," Depp and Pacino in terrific movie
","For some reason a Johnny Depp movie is always interesting. Whether it is a biopic about Ed Wood, a dark fairy tale about a man with scissors instead of hands, a movie about the greatest lover the world has ever known or a adventurous story about pirates, Depp's performance alone makes it worth seeing. Here he plays FBI-agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover using the name Donnie Brasco. He becomes a wiseguy with the help of Lefty (Al Pacino), who is sort of a loser wiseguy who desperately needs to be a mentor because most of his mafia family members look down on him. Donnie comes as a gift from heaven and it does not take long before Lefty trusts Donnie completely. The problem for FBI-agent Donnie is that he's starting to like Lefty as well.<br/><br/>The movie is a gangster movie but has its focus on the relationship between Lefty and Donnie and sometimes on other relationships. Donnie, or Joe, is married to Maggie (Anne Heche) who he hardly sees. He can not exactly tell her what he is doing and sometimes stays away for a couple of weeks. She pretends she is a widow to deal with it. We also learn about the relationships in the mafia family, including new boss Sonny (Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is more about the people and their relationships than about the events is a good thing. Sure movies like 'Goodfellas' are terrific but to see something a little different from time to time is nice as well. If you make a movie about people and their emotions you need to have some good performers to make the scenes believable. I already mentioned Depp but of course we have Pacino here as well. His Lefty is a memorable character and it is Pacino who makes sure that happens, but the fact that Depp is as good and especially believable as heavyweight Pacino says something. Of course we have Madsen who was probably the only right actor for the macho mobster Sonny.<br/><br/>Director Mike Newell seems to be a strange choice for this sometimes very violent and bloody story since he directed the terrific but sweet 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Fortunately it turns out he is the right man for this material, probably because its real subject is not gangsters but, like I said before, the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangster-genre, but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it."
"bob the moo","Null","121","142","2 May 2004"," A good gangster film with strong emotional under currents
","In the late 1970's, FBI agent Joe Pistone poses as jewel expert Donnie Brasco to win the trust of ageing mob middleman Lefty Ruggiero.  As time passes Donnie gets tighter and tighter into the mob, rising up when boss Sonny Black gets bumped up.  While Donnie puts his life at risk, his real life crumbles as he never sees his wife or children.  As he moves upwards, his friend Lefty is bypassed time and time again.  As Donnie gets deeper, the FBI start to worry and want to extract him - something that cannot be done without exposing himself and condemning Lefty to death.<br/><br/>Now that Pirates of the Caribean has made him a bankable star as well as a good actor I decided to dig out some of my old Depp videos and watch them. I have been a Depp fan since the mid-90's when I saw Arizona Dream, Ed Wood and Don Juan all in a period of 6 months -I realised then that this was not only a very talented guy but also one who seemed happy to do whatever interested him rather than whatever was going to make money.  This film is in a well known and fairly reliable genre - the Italian American gangster movie but has the strength that it is an engaging true story.  The plot follows Joe as he gets in deeper, is suspected, gets involved in battles between bosses and eventually starts to lose himself and forget what side he is actually on.  Even though this is a true story, it still basically goes where we expect mob films to go, but it manages to rise above the clich√©s by having some very good characters and emotional themes.<br/><br/>The whole gangster thing works and is gripping, but it is the relationship dynamics between Joe and Lefty that made it more interesting.  The element of going `native' when undercover has been done plenty of times, but it is the combination of this being fact and Depp's great performance that makes it work well here; we feel for Joe a great deal.  On the flipside the film also allows us to feel for the mob, or at least one of them.  The majority of the mobsters are the usual stereotypes but Lefty is written with a great deal of sympathy - he is a middleman, taking the risks, doing the dirt but always passed over and having to beg money to keep his bosses happy. These are tragic characters and the film is not the slightly glamorous gangster lifestyle that Pacino has experienced in his Godfather roles.  These two characters are well written and it is their subplots that makes the film better than the central plot (which itself is also very good).<br/><br/>Depp is good and his performance is solid even if it doesn't really rank up their with his best - he lacks his usual flair but he gives the material it's dues.  Pacino is of course, wonderful.  His character is a far cry from his Godfather work and he manages to bring such pathos to Lefty that it is impossible not to feel for him.  The support cast may not have as much in the way of character but they all do well in their roles.  Madsen, Kirby, Ivanek, Heche, Miano and others all give good support, but it is Pacino and Depp's film - which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Overall, the fact that this is a true story makes it more interesting but, while I was watching it I wasn't really thinking about it and was just enjoying the gangster film itself.  The basic story is a well worn one but is still delivery well by Newell (who was a very unusual choice for director), but it is the emotion threads involving Joe and Lefty that make the film much more than just another gangster film."
"mullermike","Null","210","259","6 October 2004"," Al Pacino's Best Movie
","Yes, I am going to make the bold claim that this is his best work. ""Are you talking about the same Al Pacino that did Scarface, Heat, AND the Godfather movies"" you ask. Yes, yes, and let me explain myself. First of all, I want to add that I LOVE Pacino's work. He has such a commanding presence on screen and nobody in cinematic history can scream as well as him (though Gene Hackman is damn good). He can scare the hell out of you with just one crazed look in his eye and he never gives a flat performance (well, except in Revolution).<br/><br/>Having said that, I think Pacino is incredible in this flick because his character is so understated. While his work often consists of playing flamboyant, over-the-top, and almost cartoonish figures(especially in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate), this film is a change of pace for him. Sure, he's still playing a mobster, but he's not as psychotic as usual, and for once, you get to see the inner struggles of a crook who deep down has a heart of gold (despite all of the murders). Pacino is perfect as Lefty, an aging crimical who wants out of the mob lifestyle, but doesn't know how to do it. Though you see the fast and fun world of mobsters in flicks like Goodfellas, this film gives you a sense that the mob life isn't that glamorous. <br/><br/>Along with Pacino's acting, Johnny Depp is delectable as Joe Pistone (Donnie Brasco) because you can see his inner torment as well. He knows that he's been assigned to infiltrate the New York mob scene, but he develops such a close bond with Lefty that it's almost hard to bring him down. A very real, human relationship permeates between the two that is very moving. I like how the characters are always joking about being a ""wise guy,"" as it provides some light chuckles, and it also shows that in order to live this lifestyle, you've gotta talk tough and act tough (as if I would know what that's like).<br/><br/>The supporting cast is particularly noteworthy. Bruno Kirby plays a great weasel, Anne Heche is wonderful as Pistone's neurotic wife (you can understand her suffering, what with being married to an FBI special agent) and Michael Madsen is reliable, once again, as a mobster (honestly, does this guy do anything besides gangster or sci-fi flicks?). Every time I watch this movie I am breathless afterwards. The acting is wonderful, the music is superb, and frankly, I can't believe this stuff actually happened. Then again, I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of it is true.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie gets 10 out of 10. I'm shocked it doesn't get more recognition, especially with such prolific actors as Pacino and Depp leading the way. This is a different kind of mob movie, as it shows a more somber side to this way of life, and I recommend it unequivocally."
"The_Movie_Cat","8","104","129","3 July 2000"," ""Fergeddaboudid!""
","For a movie that's only three years old Donnie Brasco isn't something people talk about all that much. Not exactly setting the box office alight, it's further proof that great pictures don't always translate into great financial concerns. <br/><br/>Maybe it's the nondescript title - ""Donnie Brasco"" is hardly awe-inspiring and gives little indication of what the film is about. It turns out Donnie is the undercover name for Joe Pistone (Depp), a FBI agent investigating the Mafia. He makes a connection with ""Lefty"" (Pacino), which, while his initial integration into the group seems to lack conviction, soon builds up a watchable father-son relationship. Criticisms of the film - such as the forced nature of Pistone's behaviour becoming absorbed into the Mafia mindset - are largely irrelevant as this is a ""based on a true story"" outing.<br/><br/>Engrossing and eminently watchable, with first-rate lead performances and able back-up from Michael Madsen, this is an overlooked and extremely worthwhile film. The only complaint? Depp's first scenes, wearing the most fake-looking moustache in the history of the movies. But it detracts little from what is a highly skilled picture. So Fergeddaboudid!"
"paul2001sw-1","9","93","118","26 May 2005"," Gangster movie No. 1
","In a world filled with overheated, and frequently overpraised, gangster movies, it seems to me that Mike Newell's 'Donnie Brasco', the story of a cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the mob, is arguably overlooked. Based on real life events, it contains great performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino, a complex but coherent plot, addresses universal themes (divided loyalties, the evolution of human relationships and behaviour) and the ending is genuinely moving. Perhaps it's not fast-paced enough for devotees of the genre; more likely it ""fails"" this audience for its very success in portraying the mafia as fundamentally pathetic, whereas most gangster pictures at least partly buy into the glamorous myth. But for me, this a superior film to Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', with a faint note of very black comedy that sounds behind the slaughter. Recommended."
"Snrub","10","87","110","13 November 1998"," A deeply moving and beautiful movie.
","I read movie magazines regulary and I came across a review for ""Donnie Brasco"". I read it and thought ""I would like to see that"". It isn't really a well known film and I didn't remember it coming out in the cinema. So there I saw it, in my local video rental store, near the bottom shelf and just one copy. I rented it and I watched it. And I have to say it is one of the finest movies I had ever seen. It has drama, comedy, sadness and violence and continues to entertain the viewer until the opening of the end credits.<br/><br/>The beauty of the film is that although Pacino plays a member of the mob you end up with sympathy with him due to his loyalty to Donnie (Depp). Pacino plays Lefty well. The movie is very funny in parts and sad in others. Lefty is a very funny character and is hard not to like. Michael Madsen is my favourite actor and although you don't see enough of Sonny Black in contrast to his importance in the book, what you do see of him is enjoyable. Although the film ends differently to that in the book it shows the workings of the mafia well. A splendid over-looked movie with a great cast and an atmosphere that drags you in. Yet you have to read the brilliant book to get the full story."
"lee_eisenberg","8","60","75","25 May 2006"," one scene really gives us a leg up on everything
","On one level, ""Donnie Brasco"" might just look like another mafia movie. But it's not. It tells the story of FBI agent Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who in the late 1970s was hired to infiltrate the mafia. So, he got acquainted with hit-man Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). But lo and behold, Joe got too much into the mafia lifestyle, to the point where it dominated his life and kept him from his family. And no one ended up with a very good reward at the end.<br/><br/>Both Depp and Pacino are about as intense as we expect them to be, with good support from Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, James Russo, Anne Heche and Zeljko Ivanek. With his hair all greased back, Depp looks like the ultimate mafioso. I should identify that there are two scenes that will probably make your skin crawl: the leg scene, and what they do to the Japanese waiter.<br/><br/>But don't get me wrong. This is a really good movie. It's certainly a less glamorized view of mafia life than most of Al Pacino's movies, and Johnny Depp was certainly showing the same flair for acting that he has brought to the screen for the past 16 years. Very well done."
"bkoganbing","8","58","77","20 February 2007"," The Biggest Mutt In The History Of The Mafia
","With only one real scene of violence and mayhem in the film, Donnie Brasco relies far more on character development in a story of two men and the planned betrayal of one by another in the line of duty.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays real life FBI undercover agent Joe Pistone who infiltrates the Bonano crime family through the good offices of Lefty Ruggiero, a small time Mafia button man played by Al Pacino. During the five years undercover, Pistone who used the alias of Donnie Brasco was responsible for about 200 federal indictments because of the work he did. It took a terrible strain on him and his family as the film so aptly demonstrates.<br/><br/>It must have been like old home week for Johnny Depp who made his acting bones playing a youthful undercover cop in the television series 21 Jump Street. But the difference between Officer Tom Hanson going undercover for a couple of weeks at some high school and agent Pistone living and working with the wise guys for five years afraid of being found out is the difference between Donald Duck and Donald Trump.<br/><br/>Depp's performance as Pistone/Brasco is conveyed as much by body language and closeups as with dialog. He'd like very much to return to his wife and three daughters and live a normal life, but the demands of the job make it impossible. According to Wikipedia's article on Pistone he was uniquely qualified for his undercover assignment having lived and grown up among wise guys in New Jersey. He was familiar with all the Mafia culture and could blend in easily. The strain shows on him in his scenes with wife Anne Heche, only someone with a real gift for acting could make those scenes so real.<br/><br/>Depp is matched by Al Pacino as the luckless Lefty Ruggiero. In the Mafia code he vouches for Depp and if Depp betrays trust in any way, Pacino's marked for death.<br/><br/>Lefty Ruggiero is a hired killer with as he boasts 27 contract kills to his credit. Yet he's also a family man with a lot of problems as is Depp. Even though the man is in fact evil, Pacino does make him a likable sort. It's why Depp is dreading the day he's out from undercover because it means certain death for a man who's grown to be his friend. <br/><br/>Except when the crew that Depp and Pacino are part of do ambush a rival group before in fact they do it to them, Donnie Brasco is a fairly non violent film for a gangster story. Donnie Brasco emphasizes character development and a good script as opposed to bloody mayhem.<br/><br/>I think you'll like the story about a man who turned a friend into the biggest mutt in the history of the Mafia."
"Ben_Cheshire","6","59","81","11 March 2004"," Superb mafia drama. Deeper, and rings truer than most.
","First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes - this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man ""Lefty"" (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations - best bit, his close-up after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real-life source material). Recurring catch-phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, and wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.<br/><br/>Deserves at least four stars. Recommended to anyone (except, obviously kids, for a few scenes unsuitable to them)."
"robsellke","Null","36","48","2 May 2000"," Interesting true-life story of undercover Mafia agent
","This movie was just plain good.  The plot was interesting and fast-paced, the characters were in-depth and realistic, the acting was good, and the action was great.  It is a sad movie, however.  No matter how you look at it, these things actually happened. Those men really did die.  The true story that ""Donnie Brasco"" is based on makes the movie have more depth, and obviously, more reality.  This movie also does a very good job of portraying the 70's, the time period in which the actual events took place.  It is an exciting, dangerous, and wild movie, but very down-beat.  Once you're in the mob, it's very hard to get out."

","Donnie Brascoe is one of those movies that should have been much better than it turned out to be. The back up players in the Mob were not in the least convincing ..particularly Michael Madsen.

If one of the definitions of a great movie is...you can watch it multiple times....then this is far from being a great movie.

"GeoPierpont","6","9","13","9 March 2015"," Artificial Suspense Overuse
","I have not read the book but understand Pistone was undercover for six years vs two. How the FBI could expect a family to stay together under these difficult circumstances is unconscionable. The compensation appears relatively dismal compared to the life risking role expected of it's agents.<br/><br/>However, this did make for an excellent portrayal of the many subtle intrigues of remaining in good favor with criminal elements. I enjoyed the New York City street scenes and emphasis on a family life with fellow mobsters and how they seemed to care, unless of course they were ""sent for"".<br/><br/>I noticed too many scenes were artificially created to induce suspense to see whether they uncovered the rat, and when and if they were going to kill Donnie. After you see it once, you definitely notice the annoying dialogue to make you think it could happen at any second, when nothing was further from the truth.<br/><br/>The treatment of Donnie by Lefty seemed insincere when he was clearly aware of the great potential of his newest ward. I thought there would have been more teasing and chiding than outright insulting insipid remarks. This detracted from the reality of how many people back east act towards each other.<br/><br/>The transformation of Agent Pistone to Donnie Brasco was very well done. He managed to alter many aspects of speech, gait, motions, and reactions. Depp is a respectable ally to Pacino's Lefty.<br/><br/>High recommend for discovering a unique layer of an undercover agent's life and it's repercussions both emotionally and in the criminal world."
"Theo Robertson","7","13","21","14 April 2005"," Has Its Moments But Could Have Been Better
","This is based on a true story about a FBI agent who went undercover in the mob . But there's a couple problems with this type of tale .<br/><br/>1 ) You find yourself comparing it with other true life mob tales like GOODFELLAS <br/><br/>2 ) Almost all of the audience tension should revolve around the cop coming close to getting his cover blown <br/><br/>It's interesting to note that the production of this film was held back due to the success of GOODFELLAS . Good idea because despite its own merits DONNIE BRASCO would have been viewed as a poor relation to the classic Scorsese mob flick . But even so you do find yourself comparing the two movies of which this one is the lesser . It's mainly due to the fact that GOODFELLAS opens with a sickening execution and never lets up on the shocks while DONNIE BRASCO pulls its feet very slowly . There's a lot of bad language but that's mainly due to their being a large number of talkative scenes with very little action until the second half of the movie with many of the talky scenes revolving around Donnie's home life<br/><br/>As for "" the undercover cop is going to get his cover blown "" subplot I was reminded of other movies like the classic WHITE HEAT and the little known Brit thriller ID and again this movie pales slightly in comparison with Donnie having to come up with a smart move to keep his identity secret only one time . Of course being a true story I shouldn't criticise too much since the producers were probably aware of this and didn't want to embellish the integrity of the facts <br/><br/>I did give this seven out of ten which means the positives outweigh the negatives. This is the type of movie that is almost entirely carried by the cast . Pacino once again plays a gangster but he's not some psychotic mafia don here he's more of a middle ranking gangster who loses his status to a young turk and plays his character in a far more subtle manner than what we're used to . Johnny Depp is convincing enough ( He should since the movie revolves around Donnie ) and Michael Madsen is very good , again his playing is far more subtle than what might be expected . The violent scenes despite taking a long time to come are as brutal and as memorable as anything you'd see in a Scorsese movie <br/><br/>All in all DONNIE BRASCO is worthy of your time but if it'd been about twenty minutes shorter with most of the edited out scenes having involved Donnie's domestic friction this might have actually have been a classic true life gangster film"

","This is a fascinating film, but I felt that it was unforgivably (and unforgettably) marred by Johnnie Depp's extreme comeliness. His acting was great, but c'mon! He has the skin of a model--not a single facial flaw?! He doesn't even have crow's feet or visible pores! Devoid of the leathery skin so characteristic of the true gangsters, whose excessive use of alcohol no doubt contributes to the premature dehydration of their skin, and whose deeds weigh heavily enough on their conscience to cause deeply furrowed brows, Depp looks as though he has spent his life at a health spa drinking mineral water! Really, too much! When I watched the documentary included on the DVD, I found that, sure enough, the true Joe Pistone actually looks as though he could possibly be a gangster. That was how he succeeded in feigning fraternity with Lefty for six years. Johnnie Depp? Don't think so. Totally implausible. Invraisemblable. A major casting flaw in an otherwise excellent film.<br/><br/>The story is a genuine tragedy, no doubt. And Al Pacino did a wonderful job as always--though I did note that in a couple of scenes he was empirically distinguishable from Rickie Roma in GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. I guess that's okay, though, since Roma was corrupt in his own sort of way. In other scenes, I saw the protag from SCENT OF A WOMAN. I guess that makes sense, too, however, since Lefty was aging and full of regrets as well.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing and very thought-provoking, but it takes a real effort to suspend disbelief when it comes to Depp's role. Again, not a criticism of his acting, but of the casting and/or make-up crew. I am confident that his image could have been roughed up, but for some inscrutable reason, this was not done."
"Maladjusted_1","8","5","7","23 February 2016"," An introspective contribution to the crime genre.
","'Donnie Brasco' makes a worthwhile contribution to the Mob genre. While it may not sit on the pantheon alongside 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas', it bridges a frequently overlooked dichotomy of lawmen and lawbreakers, dividing the viewer's loyalties. (This theme was built upon a decade later in 'American Gangster', although the line between good and evil was drawn more starkly in Ridley Scott's film.) Al Pacino delivers a refreshingly reserved performance as 'Lefty', an ageing gangster living in a pitiful way. The story of how he takes Johnny Depp's 'Donnie Brasco' (the pseudonym of an undercover FBI agent) under his wing, willingly jeopardising his own position, unfolds very enjoyably. We soon find (I did, at least) that the intricacies of Mob life are of secondary interest; even the precarious life of 'Donnie', our protagonist, takes a backseat to the plight of 'Lefty'. However, Depp's character is not uninteresting, simply less sympathetic. The man better known for portraying pirates and fantasy eccentrics plays the lead role with unlikely ease, and the transformation of 'Donnie' from a law-keeping man of integrity to a confidant of killers is paced very finely. Mike Newell's biographical crime film is considerably more contemplative than most other titles in the genre, and my 8/10 rating comes easily."

","FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) infiltrates the New York mob by posing as a jewel thief named Donny Brasco and befriending low-level wise-guy Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Depp is very good portraying the agent as the lines between cop and mobster begin to blur as he gets drawn deeper and deeper into the violent criminal underworld. Pacino is also very good as a discontented, aging mobster who feels sidelined, and much of the film is about the awkward friendship that develops between the two men despite Lefty's suspicions and Brasco's knowledge that Lefty will likely be 'whacked' for unwittingly facilitating the FBI operation. The film is amusing at times, especially the scenes where an exasperated Lefty explains mob etiquette and proper wise-guy behaviour to the neophyte 'good fellow'. The rest of the cast is good and, refreshingly, the film depicts mob life as somewhat less glamorous than other similarly themed films. Like most Hollywood 'biopics', some artistic license was taken and the film is far from a 'history lesson' (notably, the hit on Sonny Red was nothing like the scene in the film). Good, entertaining gangster film with a somewhat different feel from the ubiquitous Scorsese films."

","This film was awesome, Depp is phenomenal character superstar. If he's a fairy princess best believe he's a fairy princess. If he's a gangster he's gangster. Pacino is outstanding in his role as a low level mobster. This is a great movie."
"PWNYCNY","6","11","21","7 June 2009"," Johnny Depp is not believable in this movie.
","There is something sad, indeed pathetic, watching actors playing racketeers. Even more pathetic is the portrayal of a police officer actually infiltrating a gang without being found out by the gangsters. Asking the audience to empathize with a gangster is a tall order. Okay, gangsters are people too and have their good sides but to ask the audience to believe that an undercover police officer and informant can actually develop some kind of fondness for the target of his investigation is stretching things a bit far. Johnny Depp was woefully miscast for the role of the undercover officer. There is no way that Mr. Depp's character as played by Mr. Depp would not have been quickly found out. He just does not come across as a tough guy which is what he would have to have been in a world populated by tough guys. His character is too polished and stands out like a proverbial sore thumb. Al Pacino gives a far more credible performance as one of the tough guys. Indeed, he should have played Brasco. In Stalag 17 the informant was the soldier who everyone trusted. Why? Because he fit right in with all the other soldiers. The same cannot be said for Donnie Brasco in this movie who is so obviously not a gangster that it's almost laughable."

","If I hadn't seen the biker flik - I would have given this a higher rating. But its five years on, Madsens still in it, and the idea of a cop infiltrating a group of misfits, conditioned to do his duty at the same time as mingle with the criminal element, and then adjust to the new identity, is an age old storyline Yeah there are the greats in the film, yeah the main actors do their best to follow a script based on a true story, yeah there's an element of action and horror that keeps the audience watching to the end. But the portrayed story of this is soooo close to Chasing the Shadow, that I would have thought that anyone trying it again five years down the line would have adapted it accordingly for real originality (if you can make U571 or The Patriot, then anything is possible to make an original storyline appeal to the masses).<br/><br/>I do like Pacino and Depp in a lot of productions, but this one has the elements of bringing them together because, well, they had to appeal to the young and older audience to make a blockbuster.<br/><br/>Go have a look at the 1992 one with Mr Sheen, its more in line with a true story (it doesn't have sawing people into pieces though), and it works better for me as its got the reality of dealing with two ends of the legal spectrum."

","I read Joe Pistone's wonderful book from cover to cover in three days, which detailed every moment, every emotion, every amazing event from his mind-blowing six-year stint with the mafia. Now, obviously a film cannot include everything the book can, but at least select the good parts!! Donnie's relationship with Sonny Black and the way it develops would have been a very welcome addition for one.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers a solid and convincing performance, but I was less than impressed by Al Pacino who gives an uneven and frankly (by his standards) a sub-par outing, ditto for Michael Madsen. Anne Heche's emotion-filled and strong role is the main highlight for me.<br/><br/>My advice would be please read the book, first if you haven't seen this film, and if you have watched it, please read the book so you can appreciate the full extent of Agent Joseph D.

","""Donnie Brasco"" tells of an FBI agent (Depp) who infiltrates a NYC mob crew where his allegiance is tested by his growing affection for his aging wiseguy mentor (Pacino) to the dismay of his wife (Heche). The film is chock full of stereotypes with the same old character actor faces we've seen playing mob types before and lacks the grit or edge one would expect of a crime flick based on a true story. The film's matter-of-fact approach to life in the mob keeps emotions in tow with little stretching required of the players and provides a sort of ""business as usual"" backdrop for the real crux of the story, the waxing relationship between Depp and Pacino and the waning relationship between Depp and Heche. The result is moderately captivating 2 hour film with respectable marks from critics and public which should make a worthwhile small screen diversion for crime buffs. (B)"

","The saying is that a great actor can play every one, from the most powerful to the most humble. Pacino proves it here and that's explains why he is my favorite actor as he is the only one who can does this feat. Thus, after gaining fame playing a Maffia Don, he plays now a pathetic door gun, who has spent all his life obeying his bosses, killing for them and getting nothing in return except exploitation and a broken family.<br/><br/>Then, Deep arrives in his life and against all evidences that he is a ""rat"", they develop a father-son relationship. Both actors excel but Pacino moved me deeply with his interpretation. It's just great to see how he can show what a broken man is: funnily giving money and taking it back just after, being a couch potato at home, speaking about his dreams and admitting his exploitation. Even now, i can't say if he was lucid concerning Deep: did he guess the truth and reject it or was he really bluffed? In all cases, his last scenes are remarkable: the last speech with Deep in the car and his final leaving at home.<br/><br/>Deep is also good because his gradual descent into doubt is painful to watch: for a moral man, he is disgusted to see that the law enforcers are deceiving and that crooks can have big hearts.<br/><br/>In addition to this wonderful drama, the movie offers a brilliant travel back in time, with an 80's Brooklyn setting teamed with flashing suits and cars.<br/><br/>The only failures of the movie are the soundtrack (not transcending) and the casting of Heche for Deep's wife because she lacks something.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a fantastic and original movie about a total loser becoming a true winner right in time, just the opposite of ""Godfather"" where a ""winner"" becomes a loser!"
"winner55","9","4","6","25 May 2007"," elegy for a hit-man
","This film was critically well-received when first released, and almost developed a cult following. But it had two historical problems going for it - it reminded too many people of ""The Goodfellas"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". (In the DVD add-on featurette, they admit that production on the film was held up out of fear of comparisons with ""Goodfellas"".) As to comparisons with ""Goodfellas"": I think Donnie Brasco works well as a complimentary film to Scorcese's undeniable powerhouse mob film. Since both are true stories, I have a suspicion that many of the characters in the two films are based on the same real people, so we get to see them from two different perspectives.<br/><br/>As to comparisons with ""Reservoir Dogs"": It is well to remember that Tarantino's film is itself derivative of Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"". In fact, the 'undercover cop in the mob"" film has become almost a separate genre in Hong Kong, the most recent hit in the tradition being ""Infernal Affairs"", remade by Scorcese as ""The Departed""; the point being that Hong Kong pretty much set the bench-mark for this type of film, and so American films working the same material can't help but use elements originally developed by the Chinese.<br/><br/>As to the film itself: It relies very heavily on the performances of Depp and Pacino, and fortunately, they are brilliant. The final conversation between their characters is tense because Pacino plays it so straight, and his character talks in such clipped, abbreviated sentences, we can no longer read him any better than Depp's character can. (A lot of the film's tension derives from the announced fact that when the mob decides to give you a bullet-ridden retirement, it always sends your best friend to do it.) There are weaknesses in the film, principally in the script. the narrative threads leading to certain events are left unclear and unresolved; and certain connections screaming to be made are left unnoticed.<br/><br/>But Depp and Pacino are a winning team, largely because they operate with the same idea of what it means to develop character as an actor. We know they're them, so to speak, Depp and Pacino; but they're also equally Donnie and Lefty.<br/><br/>A tense, occasionally amusing, and ultimately very sad elegy for an over-the-hill hit-man with no cards left to play."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","7","13","23 September 2008"," Very Intense & Brutal Crime Story With Pacino The Main Attraction
","Al Pacino is riveting, as usual, in the co-lead role of ""Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggerio."" To me, he was the highlight of this gangster movie. He played a bad guy but one the viewer could sympathize with, and sad to say - that's just plain wrong. ""Lefty"" murdered something like 26 people, and brags about it several times in the film......and we're supposed to feel sorry for him? Well,<br/><br/>Pacino is so good actor, he pulls it off, Johnny Depp, meanwhile, was okay but I just never felt he was right for this part. He's a great actor, and maybe I'm just used to him playing strange roles instead of an undercover cop. In other words, his character wasn't convincing to me. Having said that. however, I thought he and Pacino's characters played off each other very well. The relationship between the two was outstanding to watch develop. It also contributed largely to the depressing ending as Lefty finds out Donnie's true identity.<br/><br/>This is frightening film for several reasons, mainly the tension of seeing if undercover agent ""Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone"" will succeed or be brutally exposed and killed by a ruthless band of gangsters, led by the ultra-violent ""Johnny Black."" Michael Madsen plays the latter. Is there an actor who plays so many brutal characters, effectively, as Madsen? The story is shocking in parts for its violence (i.e. the Asian restaurant scene) and is extremely profane throughout, so be warned if that is an issue with you.<br/><br/>This is not a film that will leave a good taste with you, especially with the downer of an ending.....but, hey, that's life. It's also about 15 minutes too long. We had the stereotypical cop-marriage woes soap opera parts, too, which could have been eliminated. Also, the character of the head FBI guy Mr. Pistone dealt with was ludicrous. Leave it to Hollywood to make someone of governmental/police authority one of the most unlikable guys in the film.<br/><br/>Still, if you like ""Pacino, Depp,"" and the like, you should be entertained my this based-on-a-true story film."

It was unlike Depp to star in something that appeared to be so mainstream, and the thought of Pacino playing an empathetic protagonist seemed like the perfect idea.<br/><br/>Seeing it with fresh eyes nearly twenty years later, it's clear that Newell wanted to make his Goodfellas, and Pacino was his ticket to success.<br/><br/>It has the music, it has the great cast, and it has the unpredictable violence. But what it doesn't have, is the passion that Scorcese put into that masterpiece, and the biggest problem with the film is Pacino.<br/><br/>He isn't terrible, it's just that he appears to be doing nothing more than parody, and if he says 'forget about it' once, he must say it literally 70-80 times. And that's just him.<br/><br/>There is one scene where Depp is discussing with, of all people Paul Giamatti, and Tim Blake-Nelson the different ways of saying 'forget about it' and what it connotes to, and it's a wonder that they keep straight faces throughout.<br/><br/>Thank goodness for Madsen, who is clearly the best thing in the film, and again, this is lazy casting. But thank heavens this was the time in his career when he actually put in a good performance, and whenever he's on screen, the film comes alive.<br/><br/>Pistone is portrayed as a selfish individual, yes he gets in too deep, but there's no reason to act like a child every time you interact with the real world.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's not terrible, it's just nowhere near as good as it thinks it is, hence why you never really see it quoted like the film it's trying to be.<br/><br/>It's been forgot about."

","With a cast that included Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche I honestly expected something slightly better than this. Make no mistake, it isn't a bad picture by any means. But in some places it seemed rather dark and slow-moving. Even so, Al Pacino was excellent as the hit man (Lefty Ruggiero). Johnny Depp (as the undercover FBI agent ""Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone"") and Michael Madsen (""Sonny Black"") also turned in fine performances as well. And while Anne Heche (""Maggie Pistone"") was definitely cute, I thought the movie could have used a bit more fine-tuning in the relationship between her and Johnny Depp. Perhaps if they had shown some happier moments between the two prior to him taking the undercover assignment it would have added some depth to her character. As it was, all we get to see is a strained relationship from the very start. Likewise, it seems the film ends a little too soon and it could have been drawn out a bit more. All things considered, this was a passable movie and fans of Al Pacino or Johnny Depp probably won't be too disappointed."

Al Pacino get less of the show in this movie, though every time he was on screen, he was brilliant. Johnny Depp did a great job, as always, but like I said this movie isn't good only because Al Pacino and Johnny Depp was in it. Carlito's Way had Al Pacino and Sean Penn, both of them did well but the movie still wasn't that good because of the weak plot. This movie had some touching dramatic moments and also some intense moments (since it's a story about undercover cop).

"Supachewy","5","5","10","18 August 2010"," A Not So Great Mafia Film
","Donnie Brasco stars Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, and Michael Madsen and takes place in 1978 New York and would be categorized under the Mafia genre.<br/><br/>The film is about an undercover cop, played by Depp, and his work taking out the Mafia in New York. The film starts out with Donnie Brasco (Depp) at a jeweler and how he is looking at a made man in the mafia, Lefty (Pacino), and Lefty takes him under his wing after one meeting and no background info on Brasco. Brasco then becomes Lefty's right hand man and the two of the work under Sonny Black (Madsen) and do all the usual mafia things. The main struggle of the film is how Brasco has to keep in his undercover while having a family at home and he grows very attached to Lefty as well. This film is a Mafia film with a stronger police part than in other Mafia films such as The Godfather or Goodfellas which is what makes it unique.<br/><br/>The Directing in this film was poor for two main reasons. Reason #1 is that as a viewer I felt no attachment to any of the characters. I never cared that Donnie Brasco's normal life was falling apart due to his career, I never cared that his life was in danger due to his career, I never really cared about his career. Nor did I care about how Lefty wasn't being taken seriously anymore and was passed up for promotion. Reason #2 why I thought the direction was poor is because these men are in the Mafia they are powerful men and the direction did nothing to show that it just made them look like a normal person which in my opinion was a mistake. If this movie was better directed it could of easily been considered a great film.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was decent, the best performance being by Depp. This is his biggest early role in his career that he did not work with Tim Burton and he proved here he can act well without being such an odd character which I truly enjoyed. But again as I said in the previous paragraph I felt no connection to him which is not entirely his fault but still. Pacino I thought was not very good in this film he always seemed on the same emotional level and just was sad, really I thought nothing special. Madsen I thought was very good in this film as Sonny Black. He did great portraying himself as a tough, impulsive Mafia boss and every time he was on the screen was extremely enjoyable. Now was he as good as he was in Reservoir Dogs, no. But still he is an actor that I wish I could see more of.<br/><br/>The score of this film I thought was inappropriate. It sounded like music that would be used in a drama, not a Mafia film and this often distracted me and annoyed me. I really thought this was a mistake.<br/><br/>My overall reaction to this film is that it is not very good, a strong 5/10 I would say. It had potential to be much better in my opinion. I'm not going to tell you to stay away from this film because it is pretty well reviewed I would recommend this film to those who enjoy Mafia films, just go in knowing that this is no Goodfellas or The Godfather."
"snagleywhiplash","7","3","5","12 May 2009"," Pacino Shines
","Pacino gives a fully rounded performance as a small fish in a big pool, elevating this largely predictable flick. Johnny Depp is easy on the eyes but no actor, however the screen eats him up in the tradition of other non-actor screen stars from Cybil Shepherd to John Wayne. But the movie itself aside from a few twists, is essentially a tepid remake of ""Serpico,"" another film Pacino's performance alone elevated from mediocrity. The supporting cast of wise guys in ""Brasco"" pales in comparison with the performances of wise guys in any number of films by Scorsese or Coppola and the cinematography, such as it is, has the look and feel of a Law and Order spin off. The violence is gruesome without being visceral and the writing is nothing special, except for the lines that Pacino makes his own. Parenthetically, Anne Heche, also does a decent job as Johnny's domestic partner (ironically enough, sharing her co-star's real-life ""predelections"" in the ""domestic area"")."

"ElMaruecan82","9","2","3","5 September 2012"," A poignant and insightful character study ... carried by two masterful performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino ...
","Whatever ""Donnie Brasco"" achieves is all the more impressive because it was made in 1997, after the successes of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" and much more, the film was directed by an outsider: the English Mike Newell who did ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". <br/><br/>But when you watch ""Donnie Brasco"", these considerations never matter because there's much more to appreciate than the typical gangster material, and we know that the best gangster movies were impacting because crime only provided the necessary setting to highlight much more fascinating human dilemmas. Family in ""The Godfather"", friendship in ""Once Upon a Time in America"", the gangster world is like the best amoral standard to underline some moral or redeeming qualities. <br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" is based on the true story of an undercover FBI agent named Joe Piscone who infiltrated the Mafia in the late 70's and who ultimately contributed to no less than 100 arrests, a real earthquake in gangster-land, and that there is still a price put on his head says a lot about his 'legacy', and about his talent. Infiltrated as 'Donnie Brasco', Joe went so deep in the Mafia he was at two inches of becoming a made-guy, he was a living irony as a precious man for both cops and criminals. And that's part of the excitement when you follow ""Donnie Brasco"": it invites us to watch Johnny Depp playing two roles within a role, he's Joe Pistone with the FBI and with his wife, remarkably played by Anne Heche, and within his gang, he's Donnie aka Don the Jeweler. On that double-identity level, Depp demonstrates his tremendous acting abilities as the titular character. <br/><br/>Indeed, when you look at Depp's portrayal of Brasco, his facial expressions are dark and immobile, as if he was posing for a photograph. He's literally putting a mask that never leaves his face, that's not a detail because each of his expressions and looks are calculated. He knows that any hesitation or unnatural act would sign his death warrant, so he must focus on his performance, that's method acting at its extreme. Depp embodies the pressure constantly endured by Donnie in a virtuoso performance that possibly got unnoticed because it didn't show a wide range of emotions, but it must take a superhuman acting strength to play such a restrictive roles with conviction. Depp succeed in what Di Caprio generally fails in my opinion: looking tough despite a boyish look. And Depp's convincingness is not just crucial for the film, but for the whole plot, because we have to believe that he would be immediately trusted.<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" never takes its 'based on true story' for granted, the process of Donnie's infiltration is believable because of Paul Attanasio's Oscar-nominated script (the writer was nominated for ""Quiz Show"" three years before) and Pacino's performance as Lefty Ruggiero. The film probably closes what I believe is Pacino's gangster ark, he played the most ruthless Mafia Don, Michael Corleone, a small-time gangster who went at the top, Tony Montana, and now, he's Lefty, a hit-man with a 30-year old experience, totally disillusioned about his dreams to be at the top and drinking to forget his lousy condition. We can believe that a man like that would need a rookie, someone to make him feel important in the crime hierarchy. Lefty is poignantly sympathetic when he takes Donnie under his 'protection' and teaches him all the ropes of the business. He's a living encyclopedia when it comes to the Mafia codes, so his character does not only enrich Donnie's knowledge, but also the FBI's and ours. <br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" is an informative treasure about the Mafia in the 70's, immersing us this time, in a small gang, so 'small' it kind of makes the film alternatively funny, like when they offer a lion to Lefty because he loves animals, or have fun like a bunch of kids in Florida and dramatic, the film features one of the most graphic shootouts and disposal of bodies you'll ever see, or both effects like in the ambiguous 'Japanese' restaurant scene, a moment that seems to borrow a lot from Scorsese and Tarantino. The casting is a strike of genius, Michael Madsen as the leader Sonny Black, the enemy of Sonny Red (unintentional humor) is genuinely frightening and charismatic, he lacks the boyish charm of ""Mr. Blonde"" but not the violence and Bruno Kirby is a more jovial and less violence-prone version of Joe Pesci. <br/><br/>Still, ""Donnie Brasco"" is not the chronicle of a successful undercover job, but a heart-breaking friendship story between two men, Lefty and Donnie. Joe does his job and would never consider himself a rat, unless his actions turn out to be fatal to the one who answered for him. We're all humans, and the beauty of the film is that the line between Donnie becoming a hostage to his job and developing Stockholm syndrome finds the right level of ambiguity. Donnie feels he becomes one of them but sometimes, it's the only way to be alive in the eye of the hurricane. And maybe he's not becoming one of them, but he realizes that even in this criminal and amoral world, they are like anyone. Donnie demonstrates this dilemma and Lefty proves it to be right, the most haunting scene of the film and one of Pacino's finest occurs when he leaves his house, understanding what he's sent for. He leaves his stuff in a drawer, keep it opens and leaves a last message to Donnie: ""if it had to be anyone, I'm glad it was him"". <br/><br/>At the end, he doesn't regret what he did, he still loves Donnie and that he owed him his death matters less than the nice moments they had. That's the heart of the film, and what elevates ""Donnie Brasco"" among the best of the genre, and believe me, it only gets better after each viewing."

Al Pacino's scene in the car in the climax with he pointing a gun in his own head and at the end of the movie, where Joe(Depp) receives medal for his work, the expression on Johnny Depp's face, those were some examples. Though the movie belongs to these 2 actors, but one couldn't help but praise highly the performance of Michael Madsen as Sonny Black. <br/><br/>Mike Newell's Direction is just about brilliant and according. Sometime it becomes hard to maintain the pace of a movie, especially if it's mafia one, but Newell does a good job.<br/><br/>Thumbs up for this one."

","Donnie Brasco is a terrific movie,very clever,with great plot and most amazingly it is based on true events.It is about a young FBI's agent going undercover in order to infiltrate in the mafia and succeeds in it very well.He actually gets ""more"" in the mafia lifestyle than he would like.First of all,he creates some close bounds with some people and especially with his mentor and protector,the so called ""Lefty"",a man who has been in the mob for his whole life,but is not respected that much,thing that makes him sick,as well as the fact that his son is a junkie.Also Donnie the more he gets into the mob,the more his family is being destroyed,as well as his marriage.To sum up,Donnie Brasco is a fabulous movie,with great plot,direction and superb interpretations especially from Al Pacino,Johnny Depp and Michael Madsen.The movie is about human relationships and the sacrifices some people are making in order to succeed in their careers even when it is harmful for their families."

","I love crime films so i really want see this one. I'm wrong or Donnie Brasco wasn't a very successful film, well at here in Mexico this film is not very know an also i could find the Region 1 DVD in a very good price, like $10. I mean, you couldn't find the Region 4 DVD because i think it doesn't exist so those films that only could find in Region 1 DVD are very expensive, like $50, so Donnie Brasco is not very famous or very commercial.<br/><br/>Well about the film, i love it, i really don't know what to expect but i always think that it wasn't an excellent film but i was very wrong. The story is just great, Johnny Depp is Joe Pistone an undercover FBI agent and Donnie Brasco is his character in the mission to find ""Lefty""(Pacino)<br/><br/>The director instead of put a lot violence and stuff, he show to us more the relationship between Lefty and Brasco and that became a very special relation just like brothers. and makes you think that Brasco is not going to accuse Lefty. The film has a very memorable end and many memorable scenes like when Brasco tells to Lefty that his ring was a fugazi or when Brasco don't want to enter to the Asian restaurant is really great. Also the act is amazing, maybe the best of Pacino since his best days and Johnny Depp confirm that is one of the best actors of the last years. Whit roles of Michael Madsen, that plays Sonny, is not his best role but still is good and also whit the little role of Paul Giamatti(and the scene of ""forget about it"" is also one of my favorites) now famous for Sideways and The Ilusionist.<br/><br/>And all based on a true story that was based in Pistone's book.

"sulemanashiq2","8","1","1","25 June 2020"," A hard and gritty story of deception with strong performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino.
","Donnie Brasco is based on the 1988 non-fiction book ""Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia"" by Joseph D. Pistone. It was directed by Mike Newell and starring Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, and Anne Heche in pivotal roles.<br/><br/>
Donnie Brasco is a story of two men, who grow up to love each other within the framework of teacher student relationship, It got nothing to do with sex, It was the need of the hour, the survival mode for both the characters.
It's a subtle film based on human emotions.
Donnie Brasco is a world of friendship, trust and deception, It got nothing to do with violence and mafia though it was the primarily theme of this film. Whenever you try to look a list of greatest mob films, I bet you, you'll never find this film in the leagues of GOD FELLAS or other cinema which covers the mafia as a tough world and according to some viewers Gangsters got nothing to do with emotions and relationships so, this fact extracted Donnie Brasco from their list.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting part it has two Juggernauts from two different generations of american artists collided in a world of organized crime and from their collision started a ripple of deceptions and produced a fine mafia thriller.<br/><br/>I like the way, Al Pacino shifts his gears of emotions. His joy when he entrusted Donnie (Depp),despair when he found about his son and his cancer, gore when he killed his fellow gang member, violence when they tried to dumped three dead bodies and with his usual credit he take you away far from reality in the last 10 minutes of the film, I mean you're just blown away with his act, tear treasure.<br/><br/>Pacino was equally responded by the emptiness of Johnny Depp. He was young, handsome, bold and wearier. If I've to choose between from Sean Penn from Carlito's Way I would like to go with Depp he was flawless as Donnie Brasco.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was equally great.<br/><br/>Mike Newell's direction was dense and moving, the way he captured the backstabbing, deception, violence, and particularly emotion of mafia world was terrific. His character development was stark and sensational.<br/><br/>The cinematography was brilliant and the Music score was also good.<br/><br/>Last Word:<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is one of the finest mafia thrillers of recent times, It has a hard and gritty story of deception with strong performances from Johnny Depp and Al Pacino."
"andrew-m-love","8","1","1","24 June 2020"," Great Performance by Most of the Cast
","Depp and Pacino are great, as would be expected. Most of the supporting cast is great as well but the one weak link is Anne Heche who plays Depp's wife. She comes off as extremely unsympathetic and grating. I'm not sure if the writer's intent was for us to sympathize with her for her husband being away on an undercover assignment but her performance only makes me feel sorry for Depp that he married her. Especially in the couples therapy scene when he tells the doctor her husband ""leaves all the time for long periods of time"". She knows full well why he's gone but makes it out that he just abandons his family for periods of time. Without her scenes the movie is easily 9+ stars."
"heisenberg12","10","1","1","15 June 2020"," Absorbing, Understated Mafia Drama Due to the Genre's Most Popular Hits
","This is an absorbing film based on a true story about how Joe Pistone, an FBI agent, infiltrated the mafia in the 1970s in New York City.<br/><br/>It is the first modern era film that is based on this kind of infiltration. Since Donnie Brasco, many movies have used this same formula using an undercover agent to partake in organized crime takedowns, but it was really Donnie Brasco that started, or at least rejuvenated, this form of the genre.<br/><br/>The only reason I can think that it is only a 7.7 on IMDB is probably because this mafia genre has incredibly high expectations for it with the likes of The Godfather(s), Goodfellas, and even Heat. It doesn't pack the punch that those movies have and is more subdued in its delivery, but the pacing is impeccable and there is barely a moment in the entire runtime that is even a momentary letdown, which is rare. Donnie Brasco goes in a different direction than these films, focusing distinctly on the impact the job has on Joe Pistone's marriage, as well as the relationship he unionizes with ""Lefty"", in a groundbreaking role by Al Pacino, who plays an over-the-hill, stagnated, and somewhat desperate, made mafia member who feels unappreciated and disrespected to a level that deep down inside he wants out of it.<br/><br/>Not only are the performances all solid throughout, particularly from Pacino, Ann Hesche, Michael Madsen, and Depp, but the writing is excellent and the musical score is emotionally stunning. Anyone who is a fan of the genre or classic movies in general will definitely not regret watching Donnie Brasco, a top 25 movie here. It's a 9/10, but I'm giving it a 10/10 since compared with what the average movie is today or in the past twenty years, Donnie Brasco is way above them in heart, originality, execution, and acting talent."

Based on Pistone's memoir, screenwriter Paul Attanasio and director Newell do a commendable job of taking a lot of familiar crime film elements and giving them a fresh perspective and vitality; we've seen a lot of these types before, but Lefty's sad-eyed insight is what counts. Joe's sketchy family life is undernourished--his long-suffering wife (Heche) gripes a lot about being on the verge of leaving him, and it's never clear why she doesn't--which only serves to show that his new ""adopted"" family is the one dominating his life, especially his deep bond with Lefty. Driven by the two great lead performances: Depp's abstinence from his trademark quirks for an honest portrayal, troubled and anxious while finding his loyalties and behavior torn between two extremes, and Pacino's furtive angles on brotherly love and the deep melancholy instilled in a man who brags about having a name that everyone in all five boroughs knows, yet is treated like a knockaround guy by his mob superiors.

"MovieJunkie5","8","1","1","17 March 2020"," Forget about it
","Donnie Brasco is a good different-kind of mafia movie. Doesn't rely on violence of violent scenes but on character development, relationship and interactions so you can understand the gruesome and horror in the mafia without having to see it. Depp plays one of his best roles in his career and Pacino is more of the same, born to play roles like this. It's dramatical, dark but that one scene where Depp's character explains the whole ""Forget about it"" meaning had me laughing. Great movie!"
"sirenebern","8","1","1","22 January 2020"," Gritty, dark, powerful mob drama
","I saw ""Donnie Brasco"" years ago and recently watched it again. Excellent, pleasingly subtle performances from Johnny Depp, Al Pacino and Michael Madsden make this movie well worth your time. The storyline--FBI agent Joe Pistone's undercover journey into the dark, violent world of the Bonnano crime family and how he develops a close bond with mobster Ben ""Lefty"" Ruggiero that leaves him guilt-ridden about his deception (albeit in a quest to stop organized criminal activity)--keeps you fairly riveted throughout a long-ish movie. His stint as a fake jewel fencer named ""Donnie Brasco"" continues for years as his relationship with his long-suffering wife and kids in the suburbs is stretched to the limit. While there are plenty of details that seem like mob movie cliches at this point (although Pistone was a close advisor to the movie's production and said that what was shown was highly accurate), one thing that struck me about ""Donnie Brasco"" that distinguishes it from other films in this genre was that it does not glamorize the Mafia culture or violent crime. These seem like desperate men constantly pressured to produce revenue for their superiors, and their world seems grubby, tense and unappealing. Pacino's Lefty is bitter, an ill, aging man depressed by broken promises and dead ends in his life who dreams of breaking free, although he knows that is impossible. A very different character from Michael Corleone, the wizard-like Mafia don at the pinnacle of power who manipulates the men around him like chess pieces. Lefty knows he is a pawn. He smells doom and you can smell it too.<br/><br/>Depp's Pistone/Brasco internalizes his guilt and horror, and you can see it eat away at him as he interacts with his real family in brief visits that are heart-wrenching or with his FBI contacts. You see his horror when he witnesses the violence of the gang's crimes, and this movie does not turn the violence into opera or comedy as other films in this genre have done--it is messy and awkward. Victims suffer. The camera doesn't spare you that experience. That aspect of this film impressed me the most. Interesting that the director was Mike Newell of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""!!<br/><br/>Michael Madsden's portrayal of Sonny Black is terrific -- he is truly menacing in his quiet moments. The rest of the supporting players do a fine job. Watch for two young actors in one scene in bit parts, Tim Blake Nelson and Paul Giammati, years before they became famous. Definitely watch ""Donnie Brasco"" if you are interested in true crime, the Mafia or tense character dramas. It captures a grubby, gritty, bleak corner of American life so well."

","For me, crime films have no middle ground. They're either great or they're a waste of time. This film is unexpectedly great. I did not think it would meet my standards based on the middling ratings. Outstanding acting - maybe Pacino and Depp's best - plus outstanding script and masterful direction. Pacino's character is fascinating, a made-guy who turns out to be a wannabe, and he gives it everything in his massive toolbox. Strongly recommended."

Instead these seemed generally downplayed.<br/><br/>But that's a small criticism and overall this is one of my favourite gangster films of any kind."
"PaulyFidgets","8","1","1","8 June 2019"," A Different Kind Of Mafia Movie
","It may not be as good as ""Goodfellas"" or ""The Godfather,"" but this is an extremely underrated gangster film, and it has one of Al Pacino's best performances. He plays Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero, a sad old wiseguy who has been passed up for promotion in the organization again and again. Pacino is so good in this film. He perfectly captures the resentment and disappointment of a man who just wants to be respected. He's always broke, lives in a sorta shabby apartment, and is treated with scorn by some of the other gangsters.<br/><br/>Lefty doesn't have the best judgment, which is part of why his life has turned out the way it has. His biggest mistake is to befriend ""Don The Jeweler,"" whose alias is Donnie Brasco, but who is actually an undercover FBI agent named Joe Pistone. The film is based on the real Joe Pistone's story, and Johnny Depp plays him in the movie.<br/><br/>This film is not like other gangster films. It is slow-moving, melancholy, and does not glamorize mob life at all. We see Lefty after 30 plus years and the life has been sucked out of him. There is not a whole lot of violence in the film, although there are one or two scenes that are pretty gruesome. One really cool thing about the movie is that it gives you an insider's view of the daily minutiae of mob life. There are some neat scenes of Lefty explaining to Donnie how to act like a wiseguy, how to dress, how wiseguys carry their money in a roll and not a wallet, etc.<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" does have a few negative aspects. Some of the scenes between Donnie/Joe and his wife are the same old clich√©s, and the film becomes less compelling toward the end. Still, it's well worth watching for the brooding drama and the terrific performance by Pacino."

It is a long movie but it's still worth the watch!!"
"nadeeshantennage","8","1","1","22 June 2018"," An acting masterclass
","The most incredible assets about 'Donnie Brasco' are the knee deep perfect performances by Johnny Depp and Al Pacino as Donnie and Lefty respectively.
The film is a terrifyingly authentic film about the lack of unity among mafia gangs and the kinda lengths such gang members would dare to go in order to protect themselves even if that protection is shielded by cold blooded murder.
Donnie played by Johnny Depp is seen to be stuck in an emotional crisis because he starts believing that he gets Lefty to go on a self destructive path.
The film also plays out well to portray the difficulties faced by an undercover agent and the dilemma he faces when leading two separate lives and the challenges he faces on deciding where to draw the line between his personal life and professional life and therefore, in this context the movie also pays homage to all dedicated undercover agents including the real Joseph Pistone who carried out their jobs with so much emotional heft.
Lefty played by Al Pacino while being intensely inhuman and senseless at times is portrayed as the closest to being human of all the mafia members.
specially, the emotionally tender scene where he cries out for his son in a coma gave a strain of humanity to Lefty's character.
The movie also is supported by great supporting performances.
That all being said if you are the kinda person who is patient with this kind of FBI based movie which is less toned when it comes to action/shooting sequences but manages to keep the grip of momentum throughout the flow of the plot, this movie is a must watch.
I'm going with 4/5"
"priyantha-bandara","9","1","1","3 August 2014"," Goes beyond being a movie about loyal gangsters and murderers
","Though there are ample amount of movies based on Mobsters and the Mafia led organized crime only very few that actually is mention worthy. As we all know while Godfather remains as the undisputed godfather of modern mob movies, the list gladly follows by movies like Goodfellas (1990), Scarface (1983), Heat (1995) and The Departed (2006). And Donnie Brasco is another fine jewel that so powerful and intense in revealing the underworld life of mobsters and their painfully loyal and ruthless culture. And it's based on the true character Donnie Brasco (Joseph Pistone in real) who was an undercover FBI agent who spent 6 long years with the mob (1975 -81) that ultimately came very closely to losing his natural life in the name of duty.<br/><br/>FBI agent Pistone (Johnny Depp) goes undercover as Donnie Brasco making connections with the aging hit man Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Al Pacino). After building trust with Lefty he manages to move in to big leagues and participate in mob activities and gather valuable information. But at the same time due to the work pressure and the overwhelming amount of crime he witness his perception towards certain things goes through a dramatic change. While Pistones wife and kids misses their man of the house he deeply engulfs in the mob and struggles to strike a balance.<br/><br/>One strong reason why Donnie Brasco sinks right in to the hearts of the viewers is that it has the right flavor and mix of crime and emotional drama. While it is entirely the solely expected mob crime movie it has a much unexpected value of feelings. Especially towards the end of the movie viewers get a heavy load of it and it fuels reaching a solid ending. The positive chemistry between the main leads Depp and Pacino is another winner. Both of them have big movies and scores under their belts and the director uses them to cleverly influence the viewers. While Pacino is a household name for mob movies I recall Depp appears seldom in them and another strong one being Public Enemies back in 2009. In this role Depp depicts an emotionless face but underneath he finely portrays the ambition and at the same time the fear which he hides inside.<br/><br/>The majority of the movie runs on crime but does not show crime as such. However there is one scene which is brutal and overly gruesome for even the hardest of crime movie fans. But through that scene the director gives a clear message to the viewer about the filthy reality of the mob and what Donnie has to deal while performing his duty. And no crime and mob movie is completed without a gang murder. But Donnie Brasco goes beyond being a movie about loyal gangsters and murderers."
"ashi-lance","8","1","1","6 February 2013"," Donnie Brasco: Brass, Brassiest, Brasco
","The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama.<br/><br/>The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld.<br/><br/>The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character.<br/><br/>Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10."
"KnightsofNi11","7","1","1","3 August 2010"," Good film overall
","Gangster movies reach far and extensively throughout cinema these days. The genre goes back a long ways, and has shifted its tone and changed its course many times throughout cinema history. Gangster movies can stretch from some of the best movies the world has ever seen, to some of the worst. There are many that are must see films, and then there are those that aren't worth bothering with. Donnie Brasco is one of the ones worth watching.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Edward Scissorhands) plays FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone who is on a secret undercover mission to gather information on the Mafia under the alias Donnie Brasco. He is clever, sly, and also short tempered. All these play an important role in the development in his character, as well as the story. Donnie first meets and quickly befriends Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero, one of the boss' right hand men. Because of this friendship, Donnie Brasco quickly gets his foot in the door and begins working his way up the mafia ladder. Yet, it isn't long until he becomes too engulfed in his alter ego, and he watches as the operation, as well as his family life, crumble around him.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is a movie filled with intelligent and fast paced dialog, with characters that are all very intriguing and equally important to the progression of the story. With the kind of cast line-up that Donnie Brasco advertises, you'd expect nothing less than superb. And that is what you get. The fantastic big name stars deliver a very believable look into the darker side of mafia life. The chemistry between Depp and Pacino is very convincing, as well as riveting and exciting. Every exchange between the two will have you wanting more. Watching two great actors such as Depp and Pacino is a delicious treat to the eyes and ears, especially with hearty and fulfilling dialog to carry their characters. I think I've made it clear that the character driven aspect of Donnie Brasco is nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Before I continue I should make note that Donnie Brasco is based on a true story. The key word in this description is always ""based."" When a movie is based on a true story it is expected that the truth will be stretched and dramatized for cinematic effect. However, I felt that this was only slightly true for Donnie Brasco. It seems that the movie didn't deviate much from the actual events, and this leads to a large chunk of the film simply being mob men doing mob things. Of course it all builds up and plays into the climax of the film, but I found myself losing interest towards the middle of the film. The way the film ends requires a lot of events to happen to get to that point, and some of these events aren't as thrilling as one might expect. Donnie Brasco seems to slow down and lose its focus in the middle, only to pick up again towards the end.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the story of Donnie Brasco's home life, where he is Joe Pistone. Because of his extremely secretive job, Pistone must keep many secrets from his wife and children for their own protection. While this side story ends up playing an important role in the film, I thought these scenes seemed out of place and possibly could have been worked in better. The storyline within these scenes themselves is very important and obviously very necessary. There is also the ending. The climax of the film is fantastic and will take you by surprise, but the very ending of the film is very abrupt and makes you feel like you might have missed something. It could possibly require a second viewing to fully understand what happened, but I'm not sure yet.<br/><br/>From a character standpoint Donnie Brasco is excellent. The characters are great and their dialog greater. It is a story that keeps you interested, yet also leaves something to be desired. Overall Donnie Brasco is well worth the watch."

","When a book is being adapted on the big screen, or the little screen, the director does his or her own version onto the screen. The Donnie Brasco film is somewhat 97% Hollywood and only 3% of the book. Although no film adapted from a book is 100% of the book since it often has a lot of information. But the information in this one is mixed and not always the truth. So when people see a film based on a true story, they think everything that happened in the film was real. That's why I think it's always better to read the book first before seeing the movie. <br/><br/>Besides all this, the film had a heart to it and a good motive. Though not as accurate as Goodfellas, it portrayed in an effective way the ways of the Mafia. The acting by Al Pacino, Johnny Depp and Michael Madsen was VERY good.

The most brutally honest portrayal of the life of a gangster ever created. I definitely wasn't expecting a scene like Johnny Depp cutting a guy's foot off more realistically and years before Saw become such a crave for it's brutality. Anne Heche was also surprisingly great in the best ""semi-abandoned wife of an undercover cop who is trying to care for her kids while desperately missing her husband"" role that appears in every film dealing with an undercover cop. She brought real authenticity and sympathy to the role, which I've never seen before.<br/><br/>I also thought that the film took a very interesting look into what happens when an undercover becomes too attached to one of the men he's trying to commit. The best scene of the film comes when Joe is in the garage talking to his wife and he is painfully describing that he can't reveal himself as a rat because if he does Lefty, who he has come to love as a father figure, will die for it. He's stuck in such a bind because if he doesn't reveal himself, and stays undercover, he will drive his family away until he loses them. But, if he reveals himself, he is putting the gun in Lefty's mouth and pulling the trigger. It's one of the best acted scenes I've ever witnessed, and Depp makes his emotional pain so palpable in the best acted scene of his career. I really loved this film."

","Donnie Brasco is a very unique kind of a gangster movie with complex characterization & great acting performances. Its characters are etched in great details. An undercover FBI agent Joseph Pistone (Johnny Depp) pretends to be a small time thug (Donnie Brasco) to expose the city mafia. He makes an impression on Lefty (Al Pacino) and manages to break into his gang. Lefty is a gangster who is past his prime & losing his hold. He is overstepped by Sonny Black as the leader of the gang. Donnie wins over the confidence of both Lefty & Sonny Black and moves up the ladder at the expense of Lefty's hold in the gang. Meanwhile his personal life is in ruins because of the demands of his profession.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is the relationship that Donnie forms with Lefty over the course of his stay with him. He develops a bond with him and yearns to get him of the hook. He also feels guilty about the fact that he was betraying Lefty's confidence. He begins to get disgusted with his job because of this & also his family reasons as his wife is considering a divorce.The turmoil that he goes through is very appropriately presented.<br/><br/>The performances of all the main characters are breathtaking. Both Al & Johnny are really good at their roles. Al for a change is in a demure role aptly contradicting the critics who feel that he plays only those meaty over the top roles. Equally impressive is Michael Madsen who just fits into this role with such fluidity. A one of a kind flick for the movie enthusiasts."

","The film Donnie Brasco turned out to be so much more than I expected it to be. I assumed it would be some sort of gangster, mafia, 'Goodfellas' type film that had a reasonably light atmosphere and that had two good lead actors (Depp and Pacino) delivering a witty script in an amusing manner. In a way I was incorrect to assume this as even though it started off as what I expected it to be, it then slowly and fascinatingly turned into a more complex, emotionally driven character relations story within a gang of criminals. What also surprised me was that this was based on a true story.<br/><br/>The film actually started out like I thought it would; it being reasonably light hearted early on with groups of men sitting around in a man's world laughing and joking over nothing in particular as well as containing upbeat music from the era that even I had heard before. This was counteracted with the two lead characters of 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Pacino) and Donnie Brasco himself (Depp) (who is attempting to go undercover and infiltrate this small gang of mafia hoodlums) merely standing around; talking and acting 'hard' for the opening thirty minutes or so attempting to prove a point over one another that they're the dominant character. Interestingly, Brasco stamps his authority in the relationship by, in fact, beating up one of Lefty's accomplices whom owes him money ¬ñ from then on in, every thing's fine between the two.<br/><br/>What's also interesting about the two characters is their respective situations. Both men are struggling with their domestic situations and consequently, their lives are falling away from them slightly. Brasco's job is starting to conflict with his secret domestic life and Lefty's role within the gang slips away from him slowly but surely as the film wares respectively on.<br/><br/>What Donnie Brasco actually consists of is a two and a half hour marathon of fantastic character build up through dialogue and interaction as each gang member dips in and out of the two leads' lives. Trust, respect and interaction playing a big part in a lot of it and this is extremely well put through thanks to a memorable scene in the foyer of a Japanese sushi restaurant. The constant fact we know the truth about Brasco and his links to the authorities plays a major part in actual suspense that builds up on certain occasions; be it the said restaurant scene or whenever Brasco seems to be on the phone for too long. <br/><br/>Although some scenes do seem like they drag on a little aimlessly and may lack the punch, atmosphere and actual content; other scenes come along at pleasingly paced times and it's these that definitely have the spark required for true edge of the seat viewing. With a good cast, good soundtrack, wonderful story, a truly fantastic character study as well as an ending that left me as empty as it did fulfilled, Donnie Brasco's story is one that everyone should sit through."

","The movie is touching for the realistic view it portrays of life in the mob, but I think the most touching part is when Pacino¬¥s character, Lefty, is called by his bosses in his last appearance in the film. He knows it¬¥s time to get off the bus, we know his fate, however, we didn¬¥t know how sure he was of his departure and how truly resigned he was.<br/><br/>Seeing Pacino remove his neck chain, his watch, and his wallet after kissing his helpless and unsuspicious wife is a refreshing reminder that challenging plots and admirable performance are still alive.

The rigidity of his facial gestures all along the movie, especially upon realizing the boss likes him during the boat ride, is remarkable."
"Willie-12","9","1","1","8 March 1999"," Should have been nominated
","Donnie Brasco was simply one of the best films of 1997 and should have been nominated for best picture.  Being released in February of that year didn't make it easy for the voters to remember it, but make no mistake, it was easily one of the five best movies of 1997.  The relationship that is portrayed between Donnie and Lefty is one of the most beautiful friendships ever constructed on screen (perhaps because it was taken from a true story), and the inevitable action that is taken by Donnie in the end is painfully sad.  Pacino and Depp have a chemistry that is magnificent and easily compares to some of the best pairings in cinematic history.  I only hope we'll be fortunate enough to see them again sometime in another movie. Donnie Brasco shows the more tender side of the organized crime world (don't get me wrong, it shows plenty of the ruthlessness too), the concept of ""honor among thieves"" if you will.  You realize that even though these mobsters might appear to be scum on the outside, they do have hearts and they do have feelings.  The scene where Lefty is waiting outside the hospital room where his son is, and Donnie comes in is a very good example of this.  After a little conversation between the two, Lefty simply looks at Brasco and says ""I love you Donnie.""  It's scenes like this (as well as the scene at the end) that are so moving, you begin to realize just how powerful movies can be.  This one reaches down inside and really makes you feel, and it really makes you think.  It's simply one of the most unique, and beautifully crafted mob movies ever made, as well as one of the best films of 1997."
"MovieAddict2016","7","4","9","11 January 2005"," Not as good as I had hoped but still a fine film
","I had heard a lot about ""Donnie Brasco"" and thought it would be really great. First of all it stars two of the best actors of all time - Pacino and the underrated, truly wonderful character actor Johnny Depp who has struggled throughout his entire career turning down big-budget roles in order to separate himself from the ""pretty boys."" His role here is convincing - but somehow it left me feeling a bit unimpressed overall.<br/><br/>Pacino, however, is really good and totally cast against type. Seeing the trailer, reading about the film, viewing the DVD cover, I just _knew_ it was going to be another one of Pacino's recent cocky, yelling roles (e.g. Devil's Advocate). However he really portrays his character well, and I was surprised to see him playing a loser versus the Mafia kingpin I had expected. I thought Pacino's character was a Mafia don or something, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that he's actually a lowlife in this film and Michael Madsen plays the kingpin.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film itself left me a bit underwhelmed. It's nowhere near as good, heavy or memorable as ""GoodFellas,"" which is sort of unfortunate as they're so often compared on Internet forums (just take a look at IMDb!). They're really not in the same league as far as I'm concerned and although ""Donnie Brasco"" is a fine film with two good performances, it overall just left me wanting more."
"nbrice18","5","2","4","14 September 2019"," Pacino is outstanding!
","Yes, Pacino was amazing in his portrayal of Lefty, but I still gave this movie only 5 stars. I've read Joe Pistone's book twice and am very familiar with his undercover work as ""Donnie Brasco"". Although Lefty was perfectly cast I just could NOT buy Depp as Brasco. He's a good actor, but I suppose being a fan of the Sopranos has spoiled me for good, authentic casting.<br/><br/>In no way does Depp look Italian, or even old enough to be this knock around jewel thief. He looks like a college kid. Someone with a bit more edge, Italian ancestry and age would have been a better fit. The casting of Sonny Black was off as well. It was hard to buy him as a Mafia capo. Some liberties were taken with the truth because Kings Court was in Pasco County, north of Tampa, not Miami. And yes, there were tensions in Pistone's marriage but it was overplayed for the screen. Finally, I haven't even finished watching the movie; I'm about 3/4 through and too bored too finish it."

","Recently I've been watching movies from a list named ""Movies you need to watch"" or something like that. And I noticed that a lot of gangster, mafia related ones are listed there.
Because of the list, I've seen quite a few of them. And every single one has just blurred into a single movie. This one isn't an exception.
It's a mafia movie. Nothing special, in my opinion. Although I'm not a fan for these types of movies. Everything shown in it was average. The ending was pretty neat, but nothing else.

"misteme2003","9","2","4","24 October 2004"," Deeply moving, true crime drama, superb cast SPOILERS!!!
","I just watched this movie again being a huge Depp fan, it's one of his best. Other actors his age could have been casted (Cruise, Cusack, Penn possibly) but only Johnny could have pulled it off. (If you see the real Joe Pistone in the DVD special features, you'll know why). Why is this movie so moving? Because of strong bond is the basis of what a mob family is all about..honor, loyalty, trust..it has all the elements, and they are intertwined along with the same values to which an FBI agent relies on and believes in as well. So when ""Donnie Brasco"" befriends ""Lefty"" and goes underground for 6 yrs to bring down over 100 indictments, you are swept in to the lifestyle he leads as he's ""working"". You see a friendship between two men, from different worlds in reality but undercover for one, and ignorant for the other. Johnny Depp as an Italian man is almost as polished as Al Pacino. Both were intelligently casted as was Anne Heche as the nagging wife! This film gives us (from what the director says and Pitone himself) an in depth view of the crime underworld. What we get to see from the director and writer is the humanity, the ""real"" people who live that life. Both lives for that matter, that of ""made men"" and of FBI agents. Very believable, right down to the time period, the costumes, the cars..and of course the two greatest actors..Depp and Pacino! Rent it, borrow it, buy it, whatever you can, but don't miss it. You'll find yourself feeling sorry for a mob guy and how amazing is that??"
"rmax304823","Null","2","4","5 September 2004"," Tribalism
","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>I'm fully prepared to trash Mafia movies because they've been coming out with so many of them over the last 30 years or so that they could easily be organized into a college course like, ""Deviant Behavior 201: La Cosa Nostra."" The problem is that some of them are pretty good, like ""Donnie Brasco."" And why not? Many of them involve the services of such talented Italian-Americans as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorcese, Mario Puzo, Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Brian De Palma, and Roger Corman. They tend to occur in two types. The Sensasionalistic Type (or what we call ""Type I"") are usually historical in nature and center on a Big Man, usually Al Capone, and/or an historical event, usually The St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The Ethographic Type (or ""Type II"") tries to give us an insider's view of Mafia social dynamics, introducing us to how things work around here, so to speak, like a training film. Thus, for instance, ""He's my friend,"" means ""I vouch for him and if he fouls up, I die."" But ""He's a friend of ours,"" means, ""He's a made man, a member in good standing, and if you touch him, you die.""<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"", based on an at least partially true story, gives us a lot of the insiders' codes -- but we already know most of them from reading, from the History Channel, or from previous movies. (""The Valachi Papers"" was a nice introduction.) The film makers of ""Donnie Brasco"" know that we know, so some of the codes -- the expressions (""Fuggedaboudit""), the amusing nicknames (Anthony ""The Entymologist"" Guglielmo) -- are treated as jokes to the audience. And ""Donnie Brasco"" DOES have its amusing moments.<br/><br/>But it deals too with what I'm forced to call a ""theme."" The values of the particular social world we belong to are always a little in conflict with the values of society at large. Maybe we occasionally do drugs with friends, although most people disapprove and it's against the law, after all. That sort of thing. Now multiply those discrepancies by a high value number and you are in the position of an FBI informer who infiltrates the Mafia and gets to know and finally respect at least some of them. Do you really want to blow the whistle on a trusting friend who's behavior is criminal only about 1 percent of the time? How about if he really LIKES you and promotes you in the group? And has cancer in his family? And, in his own peculiar way, is a man of principle?<br/><br/>The movie makes it easy for us to identify with Depp as the informer, and with Pacino as his mentor, and to some extent with the intimate social world of the Mafia as well. They are earthy and passionate and colorful. They eat, drink, make love, and swear with gusto. Society at large is represented by the FBI, a bunch of bloodless freaks if there ever was one. They look like computer nerds and talk like IRS auditors. When Brasco betrays the mob, which leads to the death of his friend and mentor, the FBI present him with a medal and a check for five-hundred dollars. The ceremony is perfunctory, brief, and nobody attends. A picture is taken of Depp with the measely check that has cost Pacino his life. After what the movie has shown us, the guy must have felt like a minor-league Judas.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to feel that Depp's performance was outstanding, but I thought it was competent, not much more. Maybe I'm missing something. Pacino is marvelous, though. His voice has become a rough gargle and he is old enough to look, not defeated, but thoughtful about his losses. Just right for the role. The support includes Zeljko Ivanek, also excellent in the part of an FBI agent. I wish more use would be made of him because he's a fine actor, but I suppose he'll have to change his name to something more spellable before he hits the big time. Anne Heche is competent too. She's acquired a thin but nice New York accent here. Her skeletal structure is gracile. And her features, even her prominent nose, look delicate and vulnerable. Michael Madsen is a nice gentle guy, but he makes a great screen heavy, of the thuggish type, not the caddish type. <br/><br/>Worth seeing."

","A really powerful film. Johnny Depp was absolutely excellent in a fairly conventional role. He's made his living doing oddball parts, but here he could be the guy next door (if you live in New York.) To me, as the film went on, as Brasco sank further and further into the Mafia milieu, Depp looked more and more like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. I mean a real physical resemblance, which he doesn't normally have at all. And what can you say about another masterful performance by Al Pacino. Lefty's pathos oozed right off the screen. His misplaced paternalism toward Brasco was perfect, teaching him the ropes about Mafiosi ways, like the difference between introducing someone as ""a friend of mine"" as opposed to ""a friend of ours"". Michael Madsen was reliably menacing, as always. This is really good stuff."

","There are already 282 reviews for the film Donnie Brasco. So what is there that is new that I can tell you about it ? Well, I agree that is is a great, entertaining film about the Mafia. I agree that there is much that is very different than most run of the mill gangster films, such as feeding hamburgers to a zoo animal in the back seat of a Cadillac. VERY amusing. And supposedly TRUE. I agree that the actors Pacino, Depp, Madsen, and the rest of the cast turned in excellent performances. So what can I add to that ? I would like to commend the work of Robert Miano who portrays Sonny Red in the film. One look from him would terrify me as it did those under his thumb. One look from him meant terror, danger, and a deadly threat to the recipient. No word was needed- just look at those daggers coming out of his eyes.

","I am confident I had already seen this movie during my time at college, but for some reason, I hadn't written a film review for it, and I couldn't remember anything about it, so I watched it again, directed by Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mona Lisa Smile, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). Based on a true story, in 1970s New York City, aging gangster Lefty (Al Pacino) is one of the Bonanno crime family. He is introduced to a jewel thief named Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), and is impressed with him. Lefty teaches Donnie the rules of the Mafia and introduces him to several made men, including Sonny (Michael Madsen), Nicky (When Harry Met Sally's Bruno Kirby), and Sonny Red (Robert Miano). Donnie is in fact Joseph D. Pistone, an undercover FBI agent, with a family. His wife, Maggie (Anne Heche), is constantly concerned about his undercover position, especially being away for weeks or months at a time. After the Bonanno family's street boss is killed, Sonny Red assumes his position. The crew run a series of successful shakedowns and hijackings in Brooklyn, and Pistone infiltrates the Mafia, collecting more information for the FBI via recordings. FBI supervisor Dean Blandford (Gerry Becker) takes an interest in the case and asks Pistone to incorporate Miami-based undercover FBI agent, Richie Gazzo (Rocco Sisto), into the Bonanno's operation. Though reluctant, Pistone introduces Sonny and the crew to Richie in Miami, where Donnie and Lefty hope to impress Florida mob boss, Trafficante (Val Avery). There is a point when Sonny angers Lefty for certain business decisions, but they later reconcile when Lefty's son nearly dies of a drug overdose. On the opening of Richie's overtaken nightclub, Miami police raid it, on orders from Trafficante, who was scheming with Sonny Red. Suspecting Sonny Red to be responsible, the crew, without Donnie, kill Sonny Red and two rival mobsters. The crew also kills Nicky, who was found to have been carrying out a narcotics deal and making no payments. Donnie helps with the clean-up of the bodies. With Sonny becoming the new street boss, Donnie is tasked with finding and killing Sonny Red's son, Bruno (Brian Tarantina). At home, Pistone's behaviour becomes increasingly like the criminal he is pretending to be, to the point when a dispute between him his wife becomes physical. With increasing pressure from the FBI to end the operation and make arrests, Donnie tries convincing Lefty to escape his criminal life. Bruno is tracked down, but the yacht he is hiding on has federal connections. Lefty confronts Donnie about his loyalties. At gunpoint, Lefty forces Donnie out to kill Bruno to confirm his loyalties, but FBI agents arrive and apprehend them before any murder can be committed. FBI agents visit Sonny's hangout and reveal Donnie's true identity to him and his crew by showing them photographs of Pistone. Later, Lefty is summoned to a meeting; he leaves behind his valuables so it will be implied that he has died. With his family in attendance, Pistone attends a small private ceremony for his service, after which he is given a medal and a payment. It ends with the information that the evidence collected by ""Donnie Brasco"" led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. Pistone lives with his family under a new identity in an undisclosed location, and there is a $500,000 open contract on his head. Also starring James Russo as Paulie, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri's Zeljko Ivanek as Tim Curley, Zach Grenier as Dr. Berger, Tim Blake Nelson as FBI Technician, and Paul Giamatti as FBI Technician. Pacino is good as the sleazeball gangster who shows the title character the ropes, and Depp is also good as the undercover agent who becomes the prot√É¬©g√É¬© and unintentionally becomes fond of his mentor, with good support from Madsen, Kirby and others. I am not going to pretend I found everything going on fascinating, there was a lot of ""business"" chat that went over my head. But the 1970s era is perfectly captured, there are no complaints about the characters and performances, and there are small moments of violence and dodgy deals that got my attention, but I couldn't fully get into it, in my opinion, a reasonable crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Johnny Depp was number 22, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Depp was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Pacino was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Pacino was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro), and Depp number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Worth watching, in my opinion!"

","Norman Mailer told us tough guys don't dance, but in the movies, it's mostly tough guys who do dance. We're so leery of close emotional bonds between men that the movies are only comfortable showing them if the guys are cops, jocks, soldiers or mobsters. Beneath everything else, ""Donnie Brasco'' is the story of two men who grow to love each other, within the framework of a teacher-student relationship. It's not about sex. It's about need.<br/><br/>The movie opens in a New York coffee shop that's a hangout for the mob. A young guy named Donnie (Johnny Depp) comes in and talks disrespectfully to an older guy named Lefty (Al Pacino). Lefty can't believe his ears: ""You're calling me a dumbski? You know who you're talkin' to? Lefty from Mulberry Street!'' As if that means anything.<br/><br/>Actually, though, it means a lot to Donnie Brasco, whose real name is Joe Pistone, and who is an undercover agent for the FBI. He gradually wins Lefty's trust, and it becomes clear that Lefty badly needs someone to trust; he has cancer, his son is a junkie, and his mob career is going nowhere. Donnie is a good-looking kid who listens well, and Lefty desperately needs to be a mentor. In another world, he would have been your favorite high school teacher.<br/><br/>""If I say you're a friend of mine, that means you're connected,'' Lefty explains to Donnie. ""If I say you're a friend of ours, that means you're a made guy. If I introduce you, I'm responsible for you. Anything wrong with you, I go down.'' The movie is based on a 1978 book inspired by the real ""Donnie Brasco'' case (its author is still living in the government witness protection program). The story plays like a companion to ""GoodFellas"", with the same lore, the same fierce Mafia code, the same alternation between sudden violence and weird comedy. (At one point, Lefty is summoned to a meeting with his boss and expects to be killed. Instead he's given a present--a lion, because he likes to watch wild animals on videos.) The British director Mike Newell, whose biggest hit was ""Four Weddings And A Funeral"" might seem like a strange choice for this material, but he's the right one, because the movie is not really about violence or action, it's about friendship. We can see immediately why Lefty is drawn to Donnie, but it takes a little longer to see why Donnie begins to like Lefty. After all, a guy risks his life because he trusts you; you can't help feeling like a rat if you're double-crossing him.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen plays the boss Lefty reports to. He's tall, tough, relentless--and scared, too, because when he gets bumped up a notch, the job includes a $50,000 monthly payment to the guy above him. A lot of the time these guys spend hanging around their social club, playing cards and complaining that business is bad. In this movie, Mafia guys don't get away with anything: With them, it's work, work, work, just like with everybody else.<br/><br/>Donnie has some ideas for them, including a club in Florida that he thinks might make them some money. But opening night goes wrong, and although they suspect a stoolie in their midst, what they do not suspect is that a rival mob faction was responsible. Every time I see a Mafia movie, I wonder how any Mafiosi can still be alive, given the rate of sudden, violent attrition and the willingness to shoot first and find out the rest of the facts later.<br/><br/>The Florida project and the other jobs are a backdrop for the relationship between Donnie and Lefty, which is complicated because the FBI agent has a wife and kids squirreled away in the suburbs, who go for weeks at a time without hearing from him. He can't even tell them what he does (nor would they believe him). ""I pretend I'm a widow,'' his wife tells him.<br/><br/>Eventually all of the threads, personal and criminal, come down to one moment when Lefty either will or will not act on what he knows, or thinks he knows. As the two men face their moment of truth, we are reminded what fine acting the movie contains. We expect it from Pacino, who is on ground he knows well, and is poignant and gentle as a man who is ""just a spoke in the wheel,'' a loyal soldier who lives and dies by the rules. For Johnny Depp, ""Donnie Brasco'' breaks new ground; he seems a little older here, a little wearier, and he makes the transition from stoolie to friend one subtle step at a time.<br/><br/>The violence in this movie is gruesome (a scene involving the disposal of bodies is particularly graphic). But the movie has many human qualities and contains what will be remembered as one of Pacino's finest scenes. At an important moment in his life, he puts some things in a drawer. He starts to leave, then thinks again, turns back and leaves the drawer ajar. What this implies and how it plays creates the perfect ending for the film, which fades to black--only to start up again with unnecessary footnotes. No matter; I'll remember that scene."

","The following review is an extract from the book ""Mafia films - a guide"", which is now available on Amazon. This book is very interesting not only for gangster movie lovers, but also for people who like to read about real Mafia history and facts, as the real events in which some of the movies are based are also analyzed.<br/><br/>""The film is based on real events, and tells the story of FBI agent Joseph Pistone; the first to infiltrate one of the five powerful Mafia families in New York. In the late 1970s, as he tells in his autobiographical book, Pistone was given the mission of breaking into the city's Mafia circles (...) . Pistone, of Italian background, was familiar with the lifestyle of the mafiosi who controlled the New York underworld. He too was a tough guy who spoke and moved like them, who knew very well their mentality and their way of doing things. That's why his superiors thought he would be the ideal agent for such a job, an infiltration task that aimed to hit the Mafia from the inside with a forcefulness never seen before.<br/><br/>(...) Big would also be Pistone's conflicts with his wife Maggie. She and her daughters could hardly be seen by the agent during the time of the infiltration, for obvious security reasons. Over the months, Maggie would notice a change in her husband's personality; who, in her opinion, was playing the role of a mafioso ""too"" well...<br/><br/>All this can be seen in the film, which is quite true to the real story - as Pistone himself has admitted. The former undercover agent, now in the witness protection program, worked as a consultant during the making of the film.<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" came to theaters in 1997, almost 20 years after the events shown in the film. The truth is that already in 1991 there was a project to bring Pistone's infiltration of the Bonanno family to the big screen, but it was postponed - especially because shortly before, in 1990, Martin Scorsese's famous and successful ""Goodfellas"", another film about the Mafia based also on real events, had come out. In the 1991 ""Donnie Brasco"", it was not Johnny Depp but Tom Cruise who was to play the main character; but Al Pacino was already the actor who would play Lefty Ruggiero.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays a brilliant role playing the haggard and frustrated gangster. He constantly feels displaced within the family. He, who has always ""worked hard"" for the clan, considers it unfair that it is always others who rise in the hierarchy. This can be seen very well in the sequence of the yacht, when Lefty goes very excited towards the Florida Mafia boss to greet him, but this one ignores him and only wants to know where ""Sonny Black"" is.<br/><br/>While most of what we see in the film happened in real life, screenwriter Paul Attanasio and director Mike Newell took some artistic license by slightly changing some aspects of the story. For example, the Japanese restaurant scene is completely invented. On the other hand, the film suggests that the closest gangster to Pistone/Brasco (Johnny Depp) within the Mafia was Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), when in fact the agent's closest contacts were with Sonny Black (Michael Madsen). Tony Mirra, who introduced Pistone to the Bonanno family, doesn't appear at all in the whole film - and that's a pity, because his volatile and psychopathic character (very well described in the book) could have make the movie even greater: Joe Pesci would have been the perfect candidate to play him."""

","At first I couldn't wrap my head around why this movie has a rating over 7 - it seemed as it was made by someone who wanted to make a mobster movie but hasn't ever watched one - just had someone vaguely tell him what's the point of them and the style they're presented in. At first I was of course how clean Johnny Depp looked - he sure didn't have a gangster vibe onto him. Apart from the small things - which there are many, it was laughable how poorly the whole getting Donnie into the mob thing was executed. A made guy hears about some guy with connections and instantly goes into business with him. After a few days he's all about putting his life on the line for him. It was just too rushed and it felt like anybody could simply join the mob by appearing at a cafe they reside in. When the Donnie - Lefty relationship thickened is when it got interesting. However, the movie goes quite a bit until that part comes. So I believe the last 30mins of the film are better than the 1hr30min before. The ending makes up for everything. All in all, worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of the mobster genre."

","Thank you Brooklyn 99 for making me a little more aware of this one. This definitely wasn't what I was expecting though. I didn't look into this at all, went in cold, didn't even realize Depp was in it till he popped up on screen. Depp and Pacino do a fine job here and really convey the struggles these two characters through as they traverse the precarious world of the mob from opposing angles.<br/><br/>Problem is, this starts off really clunky to me. There's so much exposition and explaining and characters that don't feel like they've fully developed or come together.<br/><br/>Fortunately, once we get passed that opening speed bump, this gets very interesting. The relationships, the struggles, the psychology of it all is fascinating to watch. So much so that by the time we reach the crescendo it is absolutely riveting.<br/><br/>If not for that opening, this would be stellar, but that opening act really drove me nuts. It also doesn't help that, in a lot of ways, The Departed is the same movie and it just did it better. It leaves Donnie Branco feeling above average and yet falling well short of what it could have been."

""Fogettaboutit!"" Having life problems? ""Fogettaboutit!"" It's one part of the endearment of this film and how I won't ""Fogettaboutit!"" anytime soon.<br/><br/>The film stars Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, a pair I never knew I wanted, Johnny being the undercover cop and Al Pacino as the gangster who's overseeing him. Johnny Depp plays a serious role, which I have never gotten to see, and it suits him perfectly- felt like Leo at times. He's always on edge about his lifestyle and how the mafia is closing its grip on his reality. That's what is striking about this movie; it's a crime drama with more emphasis on ""drama"" than actual crime. It does have all the underbelly tropes but instead of focusing on them it puts its entire focus on the psyche of Johnny Depp's titular character, Donnie. Mike Newell clearly tried to include the familiar Scorsese-isms, but they feel ""fine"" and rather derivative. Those sequences are short and are necessary to understanding Donnie's involvement so they don't feel unwelcome either.<br/><br/>The music by Patrick Doyle is suitable if a bit over-dramatic. The main theme is really the only motif present and it's repetitive almost to an extreme but isn't annoying at all. It's a fine score but not one that I would listen to on repeat. Maybe once is all.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot is super competent and stylized in such a way to where the audience is given the perspective of Donnie almost through the entire movie but as if we are observing him under the guise of being FBI agents. Many scenes will cut away to a camera lens to give the impression that Donnie is always being watched- this changes at a turning point in the film.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is a gangster flick that focuses more on a gang's interactions rather than violence. It's about how people on both sides of the law are still just people."

"liberalareblowhacks","8","0","0","23 September 2019"," A good gangster flick overall
","Donnie Brasco has always been one of those movies where certain scenes keep running through my head days after I've seen it. I like the fact that Donnie isn't portrayed by a typical typecast gangster actor who's face has already been plastered all over Scorsese films 20 times over. Depp (who I've never been a huge fan of) does a rather well job portraying a pressured, often overwhelmed, undercover agent who is trying to balance domestic life and mafia life/his career. It was also a treat to watch Pacino go from the top of the Mafia kingdom (Michael Corleone) to a two-bit button man who is constantly broke and hasn't had a promotion on the streets in years. His on-screen chemistry with Depp is very palpable, which in turn gives us well-defined and relatable characters throughout the movie. I like that this movie operates at a bit of a slower pace than what some might be used to with this genre. Don't come into this one expecting a Goodfellas-esque array of violence and action from scene to scene. This movie operates more like a soap opera and forces us to pay close attention to how the characters interact on screen. Depp has no voiceover narration like other gangster films tend to do, which can always tread that line of being excessive and pretty much coerce the viewer to think or feel a certain way about something that's happened. We have to rely solely on what he see here and thankfully Depp does a good job of showing us his character's emotional decline as the horrors of daily mafia life consume him.
One scene in particular involving the murder of rival crew members pushes him to the very limit, catching him off guard and then being forced to help in the clean-up and disposal. The conversation in the car afterward with Pacino pushes home the grim reality and fate of guys in their lifestyle. Scenes like this eventually lead us to Depp's desperation and emotional breakdown when interacting with his estranged wife later in the movie. All good stuff indeed.<br/><br/>
Give this one a shot if you haven't seen it. This movie seems to get a lot of hate for some reason. Seeing this encouraged me to buy some of the true crime books on the Donnie Brasco story, all of which were equally amazing and intense."

","Donnie Brasco is a mob movie based on the true story of FBI Special Agent Joe Pistone, played by Johnny Depp, and the New York mafia group he infiltrated in the late 1970's. This isn't your typical gangster film. Donnie Brasco has a softer touch and the emotional undercurrent that is sparse in its predecessors is what makes this movie one of the best 90's dramas. Joe Pistone poses as Donnie Brasco, an orphan jeweller that's been taken under the wing of Benjamin 'lefty' Ruggiero, a down on his luck street hustler with ""26 hits under my belt"" who has become disillusioned with the mafia institution he's given his life too. This is a raw look at the gritty working class life of a mob crew that scrap and fight for every cent they can muster. There's very little glitz and glamour within this mob and the daily hustle of making a buck wears thin on the gang and even more so on Donnie and his over the hill mentor Lefty. As impressive as Johnny Depp is, this is Al Pacino's film, the master bringing a lifetime of experience and wisdom to his role. Director Mike Newell's mafia entry is very respectable, he manages to hold his own against the likes of Coppola, Scorsese and De Palma as directors who have mastered this genre before him. Donnie Brasco gives the audience a glimpse of blue collar crime within the mob that's rarely been seen in a movie before or since."

","Based on the true life of one Joe Pistone, played in this movie by Johnny Depp, an FBI agent who infiltrated two New York mafia families in the 70s, pioneering the whole concept of deep undercover work for modern law enforcement. <br/><br/>It's also a genuinely good gangster film. It shares similarities with Goodfellas in depicting the lure of gangster life. FBI had long resisted placing agents undercover for prolonged periods of time because they feared they would become corrupted. And that's at the center in this film. Pistone, or Donnie Brasco, which is his assumed name, has to constantly struggle with maintaining his identity, his values, when every day he is surrounded by these men of wealth, power and charisma, all telling him that he's a great guy and that if he just sticks to his guns, one day he will be made.<br/><br/>Also a beautifully acted film. One of Depp's best performances, no doubt, but the true star of the film has to be Al Pacino as Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero, who becomes sort of a mentor figure for Pistone and also the one to pull him deeper under. Truly, this part couldn't be played by anyone else. When Pacino talks about gangster life, about gangster values, you buy it. You don't even hesitate. And that's what makes this film work.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is not quite The Godfathers or Goodfellas - although it's the next best thing - but if you've ever wanted to see a gangster story told at least partially from the point of view of the police, this right here is your ticket."

His final scene is all the more heartbreaking for the feeling he brings it. It's an exit that does justice to both the actor and the role.

","With its violence, action sequences and struggles for power between different factions of the Mafia, ""Donnie Brasco"" superficially appears to be a typical gangster movie. In reality, however, it's a tense, dramatic and moving account of a powerful friendship that develops between two men who, in normal circumstances, would regard each other as dangerous enemies. The fact that there's a deception at the heart of their relationship means that it will inevitably end in betrayal and the knowledge of this, causes one of the men to become painfully conflicted.<br/><br/>As it's based on the true story of an undercover FBI agent who infiltrated the New York City mob in the late-1970s, this movie is predictably gritty, realistic and fascinating to watch. It's also particularly well-written with a strong focus on its characters and brilliantly captures the look and atmosphere of the period in which it's set.<br/><br/>When jewel fence Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp) is approached by aging Mafioso, Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino), he tells the older man that the diamond he's interested in selling is a ""fugazi"" and readily goes with him to see the man who sold him the fake. At the meeting, Donnie beats up the dealer and relieves him of his Porsche to compensate Lefty for his financial loss. Suitably impressed, Lefty starts to teach Donnie about all aspects of life in the Mafia and advises him on how to dress, talk and keep his money in a roll if he wants to eventually become a ""made guy"".<br/><br/>Hit-man Lefty, who introduces Donnie to a series of other mobsters, resents the fact that he still hasn't been ""upped"" despite giving 30 years of loyal service to the mob during which he'd personally ""clipped"" 26 guys. What he doesn't realise is that Donnie is actually undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone who's systematically collecting evidence against the mob at the same time as he's rising through the ranks of the criminal organisation. Joe's total immersion in his gangster identity causes him a great deal of internal torment as he finds himself developing the characteristics of the men he's trying to bring to justice and growing further apart from his wife, his three daughters and his employers.<br/><br/>Joe then experiences more pressure when his FBI bosses want him to tie up his work with that of another agent who's operating in Miami, Florida. Luckily, when Joe tells his criminal counterparts that there are good business opportunities in Florida which the mob could usefully capitalise on, his observation is well accepted and plans follow for him and Lefty to run a nightclub in the area. Things go badly wrong after the club is raided by the police on its opening night and a shootout involving a number of gangsters follows. The closer Joe gets to the end of his mission, the more troubled he becomes about what'll happen to his mentor when his cover is eventually blown, because Mafia rules dictate that Lefty, as Joe's sponsor, would have to pay for his error of judgement with his life.<br/><br/>There's a powerful tension that runs through this movie that's fuelled by the constant danger that Pistone's in, his estrangement from his family and the anxiety and guilt that he feels about the inevitable consequences of his betrayal of Lefty. There's also a deep sense of sadness, as he knows there's nothing he can do to change the unstoppable direction of travel in which events are moving.<br/><br/>The quality of the story in this movie is matched by some top class acting with Pacino and Depp excelling in their roles. Johnny Depp's character presents a particular challenge because most of the time he's practising a deception which means that he needs to keep his natural body language under control. The subtle way in which Depp conveys what he needs to, within these constraints, is really impressive and contrasts strongly with some of his outbursts (e.g. in the Japanese restaurant) when he seemingly responds to a particular situation more spontaneously.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is sensational as a man who's been repeatedly passed over for advancement within the mob and lives with cancer, a drug-addicted son and a good deal of fear. The solace he finds in his friendship with Donnie is profound and his ability to pass on his knowledge to his prot√©g√© is rewarding and a counter-balance to the many disappointments in his life.<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" ends appropriately on a rather poignant note, as it illustrates how both its main characters are grossly under-appreciated and poorly rewarded by their respective bosses."

","I went into this movie being a tad sceptical- primarily about Depp and Pacino's chemistry. It was already Pacino's post-prime era and I've always had some concern about Depp's performances in serious movies. However, i was gladly surprised because, let's be straightforward, this movie had me absolutely on the edge of my seat. One of the best mafia movies of the 90's (and there many of them), and one that is based on a true story. A really amazing story, one that deserved to be retold on the big screen. To begin with, cinematography is quite good and enjoying to watch. Mike Newell shows he deserves much more respect in Hollywood. The movie never gets boring. 70's atmosphere is recreated perfectly, cars, dressing, music, setup, it launches you back to that era with ease.<br/><br/>Being based on a true story, the movie portrays mob life very precisely, unlike some other flicks we've seen over the years. The entire hierarchy, gangster life, their behaviour, simplicity of their conversations, the ""being made"" thing, it's both interesting and serious at the same time. One of the best things is that the movie shows how dangerous Joseph Pistone's task was. The movie had to be realistic in every aspect, and you will see, near the end, (no spoiler) how much gore and violence there is. Nothing is avoided, chopped heads, rivers of blood, everything is there. That goes to show how serious the movie is, despite being easy and comedic at moments (especially the Florida part). The performances are outstanding. Pacino- lovable gangster. You can identify with his character very much. He plays him in a very specific way, and brings out just the right emotions in the viewer. But, nothing less is expected from the legend. Depp- awesome. I don't know much about the real Joseph Pistone, but i'm sure i don't need to because this is one of Johnny's best performances. Michael Madsen is perfectly cast, too. However, i have a complaint about Anne Heche- while i have nothing against her acting skills in particular, i think she is wrongfully cast. Her chemistry with Depp could have been better. Another little thing that bothers me is the ending, which somewhat deviates from the real story and has left me a bit confused. However, that is nothing to harm this amazing movie which i will definitely be watching again. A real gem that deserves more recognition. 8/10."

I do think the film did a superb job of showing what some truly dedicated people in law enforcement will volunteer for just to bring down the 'bad guys.' Not only do these people battle with dangerous criminals, but they also go loggerheads with inept, self-serving bureaucrats. I think this is a movie well worth a gander and I highly recommend it for that next person yearning to volunteer ‚Äì 'for the team.' LESSON LEARNED: You take the risks and do all the work and the accolades are scattered amongst many non-hackers. True rewards are only personal."

","As an undercover officer, staying in disguise often entails becoming one of the criminals. Donnie Brasco offers this unique perspective, and sheds light on the relatable aspects of life in the mafia as he appears to be more criminal than cop.<br/><br/>This movie was excellent. Enthralling viewers from the beginning with a view of the daily life in the mob to how operations work; this film is truly a testament to good cinema since it reveals a part of crime life that many people seem not to understand. From holidays to heists, this movie captures the essence of what it means to be a mafioso, and how one is affected from an emotional and physical standpoint. <br/><br/>The casting in Donnie Brasco is terrific. With Al Pacino once again delivering as a patron and Johnny Depp playing the prot√©g√©, the pair in crime manage to grab viewers' hearts all the while committing murders and other foul acts. This movie, being based on the true story of Joseph D. Pistone, is one of the greater mafia movies, and is one that I highly recommend."

","Another reviewer has said it is Pacino's best. I can understand why. Here he turns down the volume and we can hear every note. Its a beautiful, subtle performance.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for Depp. In any other film with any other actor it would've been his film but unfortunately Pacino steals every scene his in.<br/><br/>Lefty (Pacino) is a small-time hood forever being passed over. Donnie Brasco (Depp) is the undercover FBI agent who Pacino befriends and vouches for to his ultimate doom. Every scene with Pacino in should be watched by every aspiring film actor (and most established ones!) to see how its done. If this sounds like a love-letter to Pacino at the expense of the rest of the cast well it is. And the supporting cast are perfect as well - Heche as Brasco's suffering wife, Madsen as Pacino's boss, Bruno Kirby as one of the gang. I could list every one. <br/><br/>Also credit must go to the director Mike Newell for making me forgive him for Hugh Grant's career with this film.<br/><br/>Some people say this is too similar to ""Goodfellas"" and indeed the release was delayed and the casting changed due to that Scorsese classic. But I say ""Donnie Brasco"" is the anti-Goodfellas - the wiseguys here are a bit too low rent/nickel and dime. And Pacino gives us the anti-Godfather. And when films are this good there's room for both in this world."

","For people who don't like 'gangster movies', like myself, there are at least 3 reasons to watch 'Donnie Brasco"". <br/><br/>It doesn't glamorize violence, unlike other movies of the genre. On the contrary, it deromanticizes the whole ""Godfather"" perspective. Although it has two disturbing scenes, those are relevant to the characters' development. It's ""back to the real world"" time, where there's nothing ""mythical"" anymore about being a mobster.<br/><br/>The superlative acting and great script. Al Pacino is amazing, and Depp is a great; the chemistry these two actors have here is exquisite. If they are multidimensional characters, it's also because of a good script and smart direction. Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are also very good in supporting roles.<br/><br/>It's a psychological, character-driven story, that goes beyond conventional 'good guys-bad guys'. ""Donnie Brasco"" is too sophisticated to make the usual point that cops and criminals are equally monstrous. There is a gruesome scene, where viewers get a sudden, shocking reminder, that these mobsters (including Pacino) are indeed, without any doubt, the bad guys. There is however an important common trait, made crystal-clear by director Mike Newell, between the police and the mafia.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is the best gangster-movie so far (Sorry, but I find ""The Godfather"", ""Casino"" and the likes to be unwatchable crap)."

","""Donnie Brasco"" is a real story, in which an undercover FBI agent infiltrates the mob and becomes a double-agent. The film director is Mike Newell and the two main stars who made it look original are Johnny Depp, as Donnie Brasco or the cop Joe Pistone, and Al Pacino playing the role of Lefty, the mobster who befriends Donnie.<br/><br/>The action takes us deep into New York City in the 1970's, where the FBI agent Joe Pistone infiltrates a well-known mafia gang. He meets Lefty, a 'made' Mafioso, and and in time gets along really well with him. He gradually becomes more involved with his new mafia friends and starts behaving like one of them. This eventually makes his wife file for divorce. When he stops reporting daily as instructed, his superiors decide to pull him out and with enough evidence.<br/><br/>The storyline is intense and the performances of Depp and Pacino make the film special. I am fascinated by mob life and the way things were back then and this movie depicts the life of the gang in great detail. Also, the evolution of Joe Piston throughout his mission is very astonishing.<br/><br/>It is well worth seeing and I truly recommend it especially to those who wish to find out more on crime life, some decades ago, in America."

","The movie is a gangster movie but has its focus on the relationship between Lefty and Donnie and sometimes on other relationships. Donnie, or Joe, is married to Maggie (Anne Heche) who he hardly sees. He can not exactly tell her what he is doing and sometimes stays away for a couple of weeks. She pretends she is a widow to deal with it. We also learn about the relationships in the mafia family, including new boss Sonny (Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is more about the people and their relationships than about the events is a good thing. Sure movies like 'Goodfellas' are terrific but to see something a little different from time to time is nice as well. If you make a movie about people and their emotions you need to have some good performers to make the scenes believable. I already mentioned Depp but of course we have Pacino here as well. His Lefty is a memorable character and it is Pacino who makes sure that happens, but the fact that Depp is as good and especially believable as heavyweight Pacino says something. Of course we have Madsen who was probably the only right actor for the macho mobster Sonny.<br/><br/>Director Mike Newell seems to be a strange choice for this sometimes very violent and bloody story since he directed the terrific but sweet 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Fortunately it turns out he is the right man for this material, probably because its real subject is not gangsters but, like I said before, the relationships between the characters. 'Donnie Brasco' has enough to offer for people who like the gangster-genre, but even if you are normally not a big fan there is still a chance you might like it."

Al Pacino is truly great as 'Lefty', so much so, that it's hard not to feel compassion for his character, before remembering, 'this guy is a murderous sociopath'. Johnny Depp is good as Pistone, and there are moments of real tension between the two main characters. Ultimately, this film is about betrayal, friendship and what really matters in life.

The scene which makes me heartache and touching is that when Al Pacino saw the picture of FBI agent Depp but does not believe he is. Pacino is really a great actor and he outshines everyone in this movie. But actually, I'm a Depp fans, so I want to talk more about Depp. In this movie I can sense the agony of Pistone, his love towards his wife,children,and his friendship towards Al Pacino. I cried a lot at the end of the movie. In China there is another gangster movie which won a lot of praise. But compared to this I found this one is more moving. Maybe Depp's character is very suitable for him to play in this movie. I saw a father who loves his wife and children. I saw a dedicated friend who cares so much about Al Pacino. I saw a great irony and agony when I saw the 500 dollar check juxtaposed with the sound of gunshot....I saw an FBI agent who got so stressed-up and nearly be driven crazy.

"Aditya_Gokhale","8","0","0","12 October 2010"," A Gangster drama with a heart
","Mike Newell's ""Donnie Brasco"" is what I call a Gangster drama with a heart!<br/><br/>This movie is not so much about gangster violence as it is about personal conflicts and inner frustrations of the two lead characters of the story.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, ""Donnie Brasco"" is about the real life ""Operation Donnie Brasco"" carried out by the FBI, in which Agent Joseph Pistone went undercover as a Jewel thief expert for infiltrating the Bonanno Crime Family in New York during the late 70s.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp stars as Joseph Pistone who goes undercover as Donnie Brasco and befriends Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Lefty is an aging, low-level mob hit-man who is not doing very good on the personal front. He does not seem to be financially well off and has a son who's a drug addict. And as is clear from the film's proceedings, he is an underdog in the family, inspite of having as many as 26 hits in his long mafia history. He seems to have remained where he is, and keeps getting stepped over. In his conversations with Donnie he keeps venting out these grievances and Donnie acts as the good listener.<br/><br/>Donnie, on the other hand, has problems of his own, trying to strike a balance between his family life and his demanding job. Anne Heche plays the Mrs. Pistone who is having a difficult time taking care of their three little daughters without their father around. What adds to her woes is the fact that her husband disappears for days together and does not divulge the details of his job to her.<br/><br/>From time to time, Donnie keeps providing his FBI fellow-men all the information he can about Lefty and the rest of the crew including Sonny Black (Michael Madsen). The story develops so forth.<br/><br/>As a gangster film, ""Donnie Brasco"" does not succeed as well as some other films out there which excel in quality. However, as a character drama centering around the two lead characters, Lefty and Pistone, it certainly delivers.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp delivers a knock-out performance as Joseph Pistone. He is simply great! He breathes so much life into the character that you can actually see his gradual transformation into a mobster when he begins to walk and talk like them, as his wife rightly puts in one key scene ""you are becoming like them""! If only he did more meaningful roles like these than all those comic book fantasy characters he plays in those countless Tim Burton films (""Ed Wood"" is an exception, of course!)<br/><br/>As for Al Pacino, it is very heartbreaking to see him as a failed gangster for once. This is the man who you've seen in numerous films as the angry, dominating, ruthless gangster who always has things his way. But ""Donnie Brasco"" is quite an exception. Here, he is the loser, who knows he is one and is constantly talking about being stepped over and sidelined all the time by others younger than him. He is tired of getting stuck at the same position inspite of a 30 year old life in the mafia and a commendable number of 'hits' under his belt.<br/><br/>Quite a few notable scenes in which Pacino is simply fabulous..one that comes to mind is the scene in which Sonny Black gets promoted or ""upped"" as they call it. Pacino's reaction is so natural and convincing, it instantly makes you empathize with him. Plenty of such moments and episodes in this film prove that Pacino delivers one of his finest acting performances in this film.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast: Quite nice, all of them. Michael Madsen is great, but we are so used to seeing him in gangster roles that it doesn't quite come off as anything different. Anne Heche does a pretty decent job as the frustrated wife of the busy FBI agent.<br/><br/>Patrick Doyle's original score is superb and melancholic and suits the mood of the film.<br/><br/>Paul Attanasio's screenplay based on Pistone's book ""Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia"" is pretty good, but one can't help but think that it certainly leaves a little to be desired.<br/><br/>Mike Newell directs well and pulls off a genre he had never attempted, pretty successfully.<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" is a fine film which succeeds more as a character drama than as a gangster flick. Absolutely ""fuh-get about it""! ;)"

","Michael Corleone. Tony Montana. Carlito Brigante. All classic gangster characters brought to life by the great Al Pacino. He can add his portrayal of Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero from ""Donnie Brasco"" to that rogue's gallery. Like a master musician, Pacino has found yet another riff on his gangster persona that is totally different from previous efforts. That's a true indication of Pacino's talent.<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of how FBI Agent Joe Pistone infiltrated a New York mafia family for years under the alias of Donnie Brasco in the late 1970s and the toll it took on him and his wife and kids. Pistone/Brasco (Johnny Depp) is taken under the wing of veteran mobster Lefty Ruggiero(aka Horse Cock) played by Al Pacino and it's the touching almost father/son relationship between them that is the heart of this movie.<br/><br/>The script does things to the story in the book that actually hurt its credibility. In the book, Pistone could not participate in any crime or even, where possible, not be present when one was taking place. In this film though, not only do we see Agent Pistone witnessing murders, we also see him hacking up corpses for disposal and stealing $300,000 from the mob. Complete nonsense, of course. The evidence he amassed would have counted for nothing if he had done that for real. To avoid participating in crimes, Agent Pistone had to constantly advise his mafia cohorts against carrying out robberies. This made them suspicious and eventually culminated in the most tense scene in the book, strangely missing from the film. One day, some wise-guys took Pistone to a warehouse and asked him for the name and number of someone who could vouch for him. If Pistone couldn't think of one or the name didn't check out, they would kill him right there and then in the warehouse. Pistone gave them and a name and number and the mobsters went to investigate, leaving Pistone to sweat it out, knowing he could die the second they returned. Hours later, the mobsters came back to the warehouse and said Pistone's alibi checked out. Pistone had to let them see that he was not taking it lightly and lashed out at one of them. They never questioned his loyalty again. That would have made an incredible scene in this movie and I don't know why it wasn't included.<br/><br/>This is one Al Pacino's best performances, his Lefty can be an ice-cold killer one minute or a desperate father the next (his son is a junkie). He gives out fatherly advice to Donnie, but is also like an annoying relative. Lefty is the opposite of Mafia don Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"" who was born into Mafia royalty and called the shots as the head honcho. Lefty is an older man way down the ranks of the mob who has missed his big chance and moans about it constantly. He feels disrespected by his Mafia colleagues and is drawn to Donnie Brasco as he is the only person in the film that gives him any respect.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does well in the title role of Donnie Brasco/Agent Pistone and this is part of what I call his Crime Trilogy; ""Public Enemies"", ""Blow"" and ""Donnie Brasco."" Michael Madsen, still riding the crest of the ""Reservoir Dogs"" wave back in 1996 when this was made, is good as mob boss Sonny Black. Sadly, Madsen's career kind of went off the rails after this and he started doing stuff like ""Species II"" and the awful Bond movie ""Die Another Day"" and he ended up doing DTV movies mostly. Oddly, this very New York movie was directed by Brit Mike Newell and this is easily the best movie he's ever made. I would like to see him do another mob movie to see if can recapture the form he showed here.<br/><br/>The script by Paul Attanasio was nominated for an Oscar and it gives a top actor like Al Pacino something he can really get his teeth into and he runs with it and makes it into something special (Pacino should have been Oscar-nominated too for his work here but he wasn't). Pacino needs material of this quality again; his recent movies ""88 Minutes"" and ""Righteous Kill"" didn't really set the world on fire.<br/><br/>""Donnie Brasco"" is an excellent mob movie that got rave reviews when it came out but is strangely forgotten about these days and never plays on TV much (possibly because it wasn't made by one of the major studios). That's a shame, as it's worth checking out if you haven't seen it."

","Donnie Brasco is one of the last true old school style gangster films. I think it's more a gangster film than a cop drama. And it definitely has some kind of Godfather-Goodfellas aura. Tough mobsters making their everyday living. Only with this small exception that Donnie Brasco doesn't praise the violence and criminal lifestyle like The Godfather. All I knew about Donnie Brasco the movie that it was very acclaimed film with great cast from director I hadn't heard anything of. I can't say that Donnie Brasco is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen but it's definitely darn good movie.<br/><br/>And Donnie Brasco has everything that one darn good movie needs: great story and screenplay, good directing and absolutely terrific cast. As much as I enjoy everything Al Pacino does, I have to say that Lefty is his best performance alongside Don Corleone (The Godfather) and Vincent Hanna (Heat). There is some depth in his performance. A beaten and disappointed man after all those years serving the family with the commitment and still being a running dog. He was tough man seen a lot in his life and at the same time he was a bit naive.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was enthralling as always. And his performance as Donnie/Joe definitely belongs into the list of his greatest.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen is always good to see in a good movie. Unfortunately, it seems like this was one of his last good performances in his career (last ones are in Kill Bill and Sin City).<br/><br/>Soundtrack is other thing I liked a lot. Original score that reminded bit Nino Rota's The Godfather score was mixed with the 70's disco. Very cool actually.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is film that I would recommend.

","Based upon the truest of true stories, ""Donnie Brasco"" presents us with a thoroughly researched look at an influential crime family that is undone by a Federal agent who literally becomes one of them. The film is based on Joe Pistone's autobiographical novel which details his infiltration of a world that rarely allows outsiders in.<br/><br/>The film's problem is, it lacks a beginning, a middle, and an end. Or the basic elements of a story. Sure this is based on reality, yet ""Donnie Brasco"" is no more than an episode in the life of some gangsters and an undercover agent. It is hard, therefore, for the audience to really get involved, especially given the lack of background we get regarding Donnie and his cohorts.<br/><br/>Having said this, the pic is well made and solidly acted, with Depp again impressing as the title character who is at war within himself and with those he loves over who he is. The film is made for Al Pacino, who slides into the role of the world weary gangster who adopts ""Donnie Brasco"" and grooms him as he would have a son.

There is of course a lot of bloodshed since the lives of those men are torn between to kill or be killed. It's also a story about human nature featured by the strange friendship that arises between the infiltrated agent(who has sometimes to behave like one of the so called ""wise men"" of the Mafia gang) and the member who acts as his ""protector"" and also featured by the familiar problems of these two prominent characters;for the infiltrated agent (performed by Johnny Depp) because he has got to stay out of home for long periods which annoys his wife very much and even puts his marriage at risk; for the petty Mafia member because he has severe problems with his son who is a drug addict. The second half of the movie is somewhat weaker than the first one since it's more about the conspiracies of the gang and the ensuing gunfights and killings than about the psychological analysis of characters shown through their actions and words.

","Based on real people and events, Donnie Brasco covers territory that I've not seen covered in other mob films. It examines the price that gets paid by those working undercover as well as their families. While unflinching in portraying the brutality of the mob, the film weaves a thread of sympathy into the fabric of mafia life and suggests that what motivates mobsters isn't always money, power or savage instinct. As much as possible, Donnie Brasco humanizes its mafia subjects without excusing their brutal acts and reveals the fundamental trap of gang life.<br/><br/>Pacino and Depp are truly masterful in their performances. I watched the film once again last night, and it's just a pleasure to watch them work. I can't imagine any other pair of actors approaching the verity they bring to the screen.

I was touched immensely, specially by the scene , enacted by Pacino, when he removes all his identification articles, jewelry, keeps it in the drawer, and walks away, to his obvious end, the death, as a punishment for his folly, with a last look at his house ! And then the resounding, one single gun shot ! Donnie gets all the honors, for his exceptional performance, but the prick of conscience, that he duped Lefty, is evident on his face ! A movie with a different perspective altogether, is worth watching, both for acting, as well as the other side of Mafia !"

","A great movie that probably doesn't get its due because of inevitable comparisons to Goodfellas (few movies match up against that competition).<br/><br/>The added element here, of course, is the FBI infiltration by Pistone, played by Johhny Depp. This was the first Depp movie that made me sit up and take notice of him other than as a ""young"" star. He's actually playing two characters within the movie. FBI agent Pistone and wiseguy Donnie. What I like about the performance is that he does a great job as Pistone acting as Donnie, making you believe you could have fooled all these wary, paranoid wiseguys. <br/><br/>Pacino as Lefty is another fantastic performance in what is now of the most powerful bodies of work by a male film actor. Compare this sad jamoke to his opposite on the spectrum of Mafia movie characters, Michael Corleone, and you have to remind yourself that it's the same actor playing both parts.<br/><br/>The supporting case is superb, especially Michael Madsen and Anne Heche.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Snoopymichele","9","0","0","22 August 2006"," Depp and Pacino, a one-two combination
","Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career as Special Agent Joseph Piscatone (aka Donnie Brasco), a man dedicated to his job to the point where he nearly loses his wife (played beautifully by Anne Heche). As such, he walks a fine line between law enforcement and a strange sort of loyalty to Lefty Ruggiero (the always brilliant Al Pacino)whom he is investigating for the FBI. The chemistry and camaraderie between Depp and Pacino is ever-present from their first scene together, to their last. Like Piscatone, the audience feels for Lefty, who at first glance is a tough mobster, but throughout the movie it is evident that he is just a foot soldier-a low man on the totem pole who has worked his whole life to be somebody in the mafia, only to sit on the sidelines and watch men like Sonny Black (Michael Madsen, playing this role to the hilt) rise through the ranks. Pacino portrays Lefty as more of a wannabe mobster than an actual menace, and it works. He's a loser, who doesn't know he is a loser. Lefty is a far cry from the powerful and hypnotic Michael Corleone.<br/><br/>This movie works on so many levels-it's not just a mob movie-it's a deep and penetrating character study of two men who are trying to survive in the worlds that they have created. For Joe, this is difficult, because he loses himself in the character of Donnie Brasco that he is now becoming. It's an atmospheric film, filled with great music, old cars, and it conjures up the toughness and dog-eat-dog world of 1970's New York City mobsters. My rating for this movie is a 9 out of 10."

","Another mafia movie? Yes, and a whole lot more. Directed by Mike Newell and based on the real life account of FBI agent Joseph Pistone, Donnie Brasco is able to transcend it's crime drama label by examining the age old battle between good and evil from a different angle. The outcome is pretty blurry.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Joe Pistone aliased ""Donnie Brasco"" who is infiltrating the 1970's New York City mafia. His main vessel into the goings-on of the mob is Benny Ruggiero a.k.a ""Lefty"", an unindemnified aging mafia underling played by Al Pacino. Pistone must earn the trust of Ruggiero in order to gain entry into the group and eventually incriminate him and his mob superiors. However, this proves more difficult as the goals of Donnie Brasco blur when Ruggiero's character emerges as a good but tragically flawed man, victimized by his own simplicity and plagued by a history that determines his future. Pistone understands that the consequence of his disclosure of evidence and unveiling of identity will result in Ruggiero, Pistone's voucher, being ""sent for"", mafia speak for a meeting where the invited is killed. Pistone develops a deep heartache for his friend making his job all the more harder. Meanwhile changes in the crime family ranks result in unforeseen circumstances. As Pistone's undercover duties grow more complicated, real life family demands remain, testing his marriage. But underlying throughout the film is his growing guilt over the hit that would be placed on Ruggiero when ""Donnie Brasco"" is revealed to the mob as Special Agent Joe Pistone.<br/><br/>Rarely do you find a film with so many layers beautifully acted by all, supporting cast included. The dialogue between Pacino and Depp is unforgettable with a full range of humor and drama that will have you remembering entire conversations word for word. The overall production is unintentional, appropriately realistic and inventively devoid of over-stylized techniques making it a true original. Unfortunately, Donnie Brasco is often overlooked when we think of the great mafia inspired crime-dramas. The only reason I can find for this unfair exclusion is that this film appropriately bleeds realism, not romanticism. For this reason I think some viewers are left with a sour taste in their mouths having had the all powerful image of the American mobster examined under a more critical microscope. Donnie Brasco goes beyond stereotypes to reveal men in their totality and in doing so finds it's own unique place in the mafia film genre."

","Donnie is a brilliant film from start to finish. Al and Depp have great chemistry. Wonderful script, realistic/brilliant acting.

Donnie Brasco is a must see, no, a MUST HAVE. It's been definitely underrated (on the IMDb). One of my favourite films. If I could mention anything that I found disappointing about the film, I would say that i felt that the ending could have been slightly longer and a little more revealing (that's just my opinion, maybe I was just enjoying the film so much I didn't want it to end)."

"MotoMike","9","0","0","7 December 2005"," A surprisingly compelling adaptation of a true story
","I had somewhat high hopes for this movie, but ended up amazed at how scene after scene turned out to be totally engrossing. Johnny Depp was mesmerizing and Al Pacino gave perhaps the most understated performance of his career. I've recently seen Goodfellas, and comparisons are unavoidable; they're both masterpieces but have very different characters. Goodfellas is vintage Scorsese; if there was a film he was born to make, this was it. Donnie Brasco, on the other hand, tells the by-now-familiar story of the tensions felt by the FBI Mafia infiltrator: the fear that his cover will be blown, the sense of abandonment by his family as they cope with his absence, and, most of all, a sense of identification with the group he is trying to send to prison. We've seen this before: Wiseguy (the TV series) played similar tunes (even having a central mobster named Sonny). More recently, The Sopranos tells as part of its sheaf of stories that of a mobster rat. I'm not as crazy about Michael Madsen's performance as other reviewers have been, and Ann Heche as Mrs. Pistone didn't do much for me. But the decidedly unglamorous portrayal of mobster life as lived by Lefty (Pacino's character) was wonderfully nuanced and detailed: his taste in clothes, his character's essential stupidity (cross-played with an almost animal instinct that doesn't always serve him well), and his tragic grief at his son's fate don't have any false notes in them.<br/><br/>I could, by now, get sick of Mafia flicks. After awhile, they rely on the same stereotypes of no trust, sudden violence, borderline or downright psychopathic personalities, and power games. But the performances and constant state of tension in this one made it very rewarding."

","This movie, is one of the best Mob films that we have today. While The Godfather provides us with a romantic view into the lives of Mafia bosses living in America and the movie Goodfellas gives us a different view of the mafia, showing us that they can be self destructive, and not always as organized as we think they are. There are many other Mob films out there, yet most of them aren't as well directed and written as the true story of Donnie Brasco, with the exception of the two latter mentioned films. I have seen them all, and i consider Donnie Brasco as number four, in the list of movies about the Italian Mafia.<br/><br/>1)The Godfather movies 2)Goodfellas 3)Casino 4)Donnie Brasco 5)Gotti<br/><br/>That is the list that i have formulated, after viewing each of these films several times. The Godfather is first as it has the best story, proving that a fictional story is always better than a true story. As it is the only movie on my list that is completely fictitious. While the Godfather is obviously based on non-fiction, the story is based on the fictional book ""The Godfather"", by Mario Puzo. As for Goodfellas, and Casino, these two films were directed by Martin Scorsese and were written by Nicholas Pileggi. These movies have also great acting, provided by Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, and Frank Vincent who are excellent at the job of delivering great Mafioso impersonations, and are based on true stories.<br/><br/>Now, Gotti is a documentary movie, solely based on the rise and fall of New York Italian Gambino mob boss John Gotti. I recommend you watch it if you are a fan of the Mob.<br/><br/>Then finally we have Donnie Brasco, starting Al Pacino, and Johnny Depp. Such a strange combination of actors for a movie like this one, the true story of Joe Pistone, an FBI agent played by Johnny Depp, who infiltrates the Mob. Al Pacino, one of the greatest actors of our time, plays ""Lefty "" Ruggiero, a wise guy Mafioso who is determined to become more powerful in the Italian Mob. However, he has a hard time getting respect from his superiors, as they see him as an old man with Testicular cancer. Its quite a touching story, if you like the Italian Mafia, and smile when they succeed, as their success will not be the main point of this true story."

","At times more like Heat in style rather than Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco is a mix of many gangster films that have gone before, drawing parallels between mob life, and the real family life of each character, and showing the blurring of boundaries which can often occur. The style, the dialogue, the wit, the violence, everything we would expect to see is here, but there are enough good moments to keep the movie unique, and there are some good performances from typically very good actors. The film does not dwell on the scenes of murder, but rather focuses on characterisation, and the relationship between Donnie Brasco, the undercover agent who succumbs to the mafia way, and Lefty, an aging mobster who, in spite of his dedication and respected work has little to show for it, and never seems to rise through the ranks.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Joe, an FBI agent, married with kids. He goes undercover as Donnie Brasco, an orphan from Florida to try and infiltrate the New York mafia. When Lefty, a member, takes interest in him, Donnie becomes part of the gang. Lefty teaches him everything and acts like a father, and they become close as Donnie sees how Lefty wishes he could get away with his family, and hates the fact that he is always 'passed over'. Madesen plays Sonny Black, a member who is rising ahead of Lefty even though he is younger and has done less. They move to Florida as Black tries to set up on his own, but the FBI raid his new club. They believe there is a rat, and kill one of their own thinking it was him. Lefty and Donnie know he was not a rat though. Black decides to kill Sonny Red and the other bosses so that he can have New York, and by this time Donnie is respected in the group and may one day become a 'made man'. His family have been deserted, and the FBI do not know what he is doing. Brasco says he is trying to get Lefty out of the group before he is killed, as when Brasco is uncovered, Lefty will undoubtedly die. Brasco is becoming just like the men he was supposed to be putting away, and getting deeper into trouble with each day.<br/><br/>Overall it is the acting which keeps the film running at a steady, watchable pace. Depp is very good as Brasco, convincing in his dual roles and in his portrayal of how easy it can be to be seduced by power. Pacino is on familiar territory, and again is intense and thoughtful when he needs to be, giving another strong performance. Madsen is also good as the short-fused Sonny Black, and everyone else does what they have to do. The script is nothing we haven't seen before, and although it sometimes seems like it is trying to too easily explain the ways and words of the mob, it still has a few refreshing moments. The life seems less glitzy than in other gangster films, and there are few shows of extravagance. These men seem to be low on the ladder, and not as good at what they do as other characters from other movies. We are left feeling great sympathy towards Lefty, even though he has been in the game for so long, he seems naive and in need of a real son or someone to connect with. He never gets a break, and is always the man given the smaller jobs. He has been in the business for so long that he knows little else though, and we sense from the start that he will never get away. Even though Joe completes his job, he knows blood will be forever on his hands and after having a taste of the high life, it will be difficult for him to return to normality.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","This is without question a must see film for several reasons. Firstly, Al Pacino (Lefty Ruggiero) and Johnny Depp (Donnie Brasco) are captivating and absorbing coz they paint a realistic portrait of a low level mobster and an undercover cop. Secondly, for the first time (that I know of), Mafia is shown from a different position; the viewer is revealed a member of organized crime on the bottom rung of the ladder, instead of the usual criminal hero. Likewise, this flick displays a potent chemistry between the two stars who both put humor and tragedy on the screen.

Along the lines of scarface and goodfellas (although goodfellas is better), this film is about the rise and fall of a small time hood, with a twist. Good story, great acting, great dialogue, lots of humor (the burial of Lefty on the beach, not in a ""hit"", its funny), a good sum of drama, though the ending could have been more dramatic if we knew what happened to Lefty, but they didn't tell us. I guess,according to hearing the gunshot, we are to assume he was whacked, i just wish they would have told us. Also they could have gone more into the relationship that forms between Donnie and Lefty to make the film whole. Overall a great mafia movie worth owning, 8 out of a 10."

Very effective, and a tribute to the players and director.<br/><br/>Some years back I read the book this movie was based on. Although the story was faithfully told, the depth of Pistone's betrayal of his friends (and wife and kids) and his egotism were not adequately portrayed.

","While the early to mid 90's had a slew of mafia films, 'Donnie Brasco' stands out. With its rich screenplay and strong performances, 'Donnie Brasco' is a good film that ultimately is more about the friendship between two people rather than the mafia.<br/><br/>Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an excellent FBI agent who goes undercover in the 1970s New York mob as diamond salesman Donnie Brasco. His lead man is Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), an aging and somewhat of a lowlife gangster who sees his chance for redemption in ""Donnie"". Pistone's wife, Maggie (Ann Heche) doesn't know much about her husband's career and soon their marriage begins to get rocky as he spends more and more time undercover, eventually seemingly one of the mafia's own. Also playing a central role in the story is Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), an up and coming gangster who seems to be getting more respect than Lefty. As the plot develops, Pistone loses himself in the role of Brasco and forms a true bond with Lefty. To his knowledge, and to the knowledge of his fellow mafia members Donnie is a trustworthy gentleman, and the friendship between Lefty and Donnie only increases. Lefty is clearly a degenerate, he constantly mumbles and complains about the poor treatment he gets from mafia chieftain Sonny Red (Robert Maino), and also is constantly asking people for money. He forms a true friendship with Donnie as he tries to gain some altitude back, and as he sees Black getting higher and higher than he does. Soon, the situation begins to escalate as the FBI begins to close in on Pistone's case, and Pistone must make a difficult decision about Lefty who he has formed the true bond with.<br/><br/>Paul Attanasiano (Quiz Kids) based his screenplay on the novel of the same name by the real life Pistone and Richard Wooley. While the novel is a clear autobiography of sorts, the film has no narration. Instead the narrative is made clear by Attanasiano's script as he blends the life of Pistone and of Brasco, two separate characters who eventually become one. His screenplay is dynamite. Many mafia films showcase tough guy dialog, but in the instance of 'Donnie Brasco' this dialog serves a higher purpose. The conversations and the actions between Lefty and Donnie form a true relationship, despite their opposite professions. There are also some magnetic scenes of drama and brutal violence, especially at a Japanese bar when Donnie doesn't want to take his shoe off. While some background characters may seem like the typical mafia lowlifes, the simple characterization of Lefty and Donnie is pure magic. Mike Newell, who's previous list of credits include the comedy 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' brings appropriate direction to the film. This film is not necessarily about the mafia at a certain time like 'Goodfellas' or 'The Godfather' is, but rather more of a relationship film, showing the way two men come together despite their circumstances. Also very worthy of mention is talented composer Patrick Doyle's musical score, which adds to the emotional effect of many scenes. The performances by Pacino and Depp, as usual, are fantastic. Pacino is given a real chance to shine as the aging Lefty, a man unlike his charismatic character in 'The Godfather' series. Depp once again displays his ability to simply submerge himself completely in a role, and as an added bonus the character acts, adding on layers.<br/><br/>'Donnie Brasco' is a good film. The fresh screenplay, strong acting, and sharp direction makes it very worthy of mention. While it at times gets too slow, or the story sometimes loses focus, it still is a very worthy film of watching.<br/><br/>9/10"

","As a fan of this film I recently read the book, I was surprised out how inaccurate the movie adaptation was, but it didn't bother me as I felt (and still feel) that this was one of the best mob movies the 90s had to offer.<br/><br/>Mob movie it may be, but at the root of it is real human drama. The sacrifices made by Joe Pistone, his dedication to his job and his courage, in light of what it was doing to his family, what it could do to him. But it is the relationship between Joe (alias Donnie Brasco) and his Mafia counterpart, Lefty that really drive the story. It certainly does help that they are played by two of the greatest actors of their respective generations.<br/><br/>Al Pacino delivers one of his best performances in years, as the likable, quirky gangster Lefty. A character as ruthless as some of his other gangster parts (Tony Montana, Michael Corleone), but surrounded with real warmth and a slight air of tragedy (not too dissimilar from Carlito Brigante).<br/><br/>Depp is also on top form. He subsequently delivered very accurate performances of real-lifers Hunter S. Thompson / Raoul Duke and George Jung, right down to their most subtle mannerisms. I can only assume the same level of authenticity, bearing in mind the amount of time he spent with the real Pistone. Either way it's a solid performance, and he delivers the difficult part of a double-life convincingly.<br/><br/>The supporting cast all do their job well with Bruno ""Young Clemenza"" Kirby as the Joe Pesci-alike (in name, too) Nicky Santora, and Anne Heche turning in a solid performance as the troubled housewife. Michael Madsen in a tailor-made likable tough guy role: an offer you can't refuse. Unfortunately these characters aren't developed nearly as well as they are in the book, with more emphasis on the Donnie and Lefty relationship. However with its slick pace, I find this a minor critique.<br/><br/>There are parts from the book that would've worked really well in the movie, but I am very happy with what we've got.

In Depp's case we see a great detailed portrait of life as an undercover agent, and what problems it brings, also on the home front.<br/><br/>Depp and Pacino works really good together, and i'm gonna be honest, i'm a big fan of Depp, and he does indeed once again show me why, this man is so talented, and the way he absorbs his character and gives them a bit of himself is really amazing, he once again does an amazing job here. Pacino is playing his perfect role, the mob, how many times has he done this sort of role now? I think it's many times, but he works very well in them, his whole attitude just makes him seem like a very realistic mob guy.<br/><br/>The directing in the movie is basically a standard job, i think many could have done a better job, the direction doesn't feel very deep, there aren't really any things there are noticed. Something i think makes a great director is when you can watch the movie and spot who made it because he uses personal phrases in it. This could have been directed by anybody, it's the acting that kicks this movie alive, together with a good storyline.<br/><br/>For a sum up, i must say i liked this movie a lot, maybe i liked it better because i found the particular subject interesting, but either way. It is a good movie, and it is well done, especially the brilliant cast brings good light to a good story. A story that shows a different angle of the mob side, in a very brilliant way. It's a movie to remember.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A good actor is one who we forget is on the screen seeing the character rather than the performer. Johnny Depp seems to achieve this often in his career and once again we are treated to an outstanding performance in Donnie Brasco. Depp plays FBI Agent Joe Pistone who goes undercover to infiltrate a New york mob family. Hollywood has been there done that with this subject matter many times over but this film has a feel that is different than most of those over the top productions. Joe Pistone becomes his alter ego Donnie Brasco, blurring the line between his job and reality. This is an intricate character study not a film full of flying bullets and cheesy bravado. Depp and Al Pacino both give Oscar worthy efforts as you see the fondness develop between their characters over the course of the story making the inevitable ending that much tougher for Pistone to deal with."

","While Johnny and Al are one of my all-time favourite actors, I was up to see this movie. It was just what I expected, an interesting story about an secret FBI agent(Johnny Depp) that was living a so called ""double-life"", as a though and cruel gangster with Benny(Al Pacino) and as a family father in a depressive relationship with his wife. Anyway, this movie got many interesting details that makes me like this movie more. First of all, the fantastic cars that they use in the movie! I mean, who does'nt like a 78' Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham? I liked it very much that they used almost one type of cars; the cadillacs(except for the terrific Mercedes-Benz and some other vehicles)... And then we got Al Pacinos clothes... Man, they¬¥re really something... And the third point is the funny music. Comparing classical music with such songs like ""Disco inferno""(The Trammps) and ""One way or another""(Blondie) is a funny thing that makes the hole movie better.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

","I didn't know much about ""Donnie Brasco"" when I watched it, and I really didn't know what to expect.  What I got, however, was an intense, unnerving drama dealing with one's man struggle to cope with two different lives.<br/><br/>First of all, the direction of Mike Newell and the cinematography of Peter Sova were breathtaking.  They manage to keep the atmosphere dark, yet with glimpses of light as if to show the hopefulness in even the worst circumstances.  The acting is also incredible, with Johnny Depp even, in my opinion, out-acting Al Pacino.  Also, Patrick Doyle does an excellent job with the score, similar to the direction and cinematography in its tones. The best thing about the movie, though, is the brilliant way in which it shows the effect an undercover job can have on one's family, one's marriage, and even one's friendships.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is against the director that I just recently praised.  The pacing at the beginning of the movie fails to satisfy.  It starts and stops, until finally, after the first 20 or 30 minutes it decides where it's going and follows the right path to near perfection.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A."

","The main interest in Donnie Brasco is the characters and their relationships, as the film questions the hypocrisy of the mob's supposed principles of honour and respect. Pacino's character draws sympathy in a way that an old family dog might. One of his most subtle yet impressive performances as an ageing mobster. This is supported well by Johnny Depp as the protagonist. As the undercover cop in an operation to infiltrate the mob, we follow Depp's character in his descent into mob life. Depp proves his versatility once again; this is a straighter role than you might expect, but he does it as convincingly as he has done any other role. The support cast is less memorable, though Michael Madsen is typically edgy as the psycho-gangster. Director Mike Newell handles the pace comfortably, gently shifting from low to high tension. I would mark this as one of the most enjoyable films of the gangster genre, as stereotypes are largely ignored in favour of a more unexpected portrayal of gangster life."

","A mafia movie either makes for a stud or a dud.  To make a classic mafia film work, there has to be a great chemistry between the cast.  There is no doubt about the chemistry when Al Pacino and Jonney Depp are involved in the film `Donnie Brasco.'  Al Pacino plays the character Benjamin `Lefty' Ruggerio.  Lefty has been in the business for quite sometime, but still hasn't been recognized for the respect that he feels he deserves.  Depp plays Donnie Brasco, a young eager man trying to make his way into the mob. The twist comes as Brasco is a FBI agent named Joseph Pistone, who is collecting evidence to take down a New York mob organization.<br/><br/>The main story line for this movie is a student/teacher relationship. Pacino's character takes `Brasco' in under his wing.  When a new person is introduced in the mafia, the person who brought him in has to take full responsibility for all the actions committed by the new gangsta.  So, Lefty takes a chance on Brasco, and introduces him to his boys.  I found it interesting and funny when Lefty explains to Brasco, `When I introduce you, I'll say this is a friend of mine that means your good.  If I say this is a friend of ours that means your dead.'  From day one, Lefty plays as a mentor towards Brasco.  He watches his every move to make sure his new boy on the job acts real gansta.  Lefty even tells him to shave his mustache off and start wearing suits, because that's what `real Mafioso men' wear. Everything is going as planned for Brasco.  He is gathering all the information needed to bring this mob down, and on top of all of that, he is the new hit man whom everyone can't stop talking about. Then the unexpected happened.  Brasco character was starting to grow attached to his new life, and he was leaving his wife and children behind.  He knew that if he blew his cover, Lefty would have to take the heat for it, and the other mobstas would kill him for bringing a rat into the group.  Brasco couldn't betray someone who he looked to as a father figure.  His marriage was falling apart, and he was growing accustomed to the Mafioso ways.  The only thing that could set him on the right tract is his family and other co-workers. Does he do it? Does he betray the only man he has known to be anywhere close to a father? This movie is based on a true story.  It is filled with suspense and drama that keep my eyes peeled to the TV set.  This movie is a good example of life, respect, and honor.  Some critics have mentioned that Donnie Brasco didn't get the attention it deserved as a film.  This film is Oscar material, but didn't get the acclaim for it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is an Al Pacino fan, and knows what a good mob movie is all about.  If viewers don't like the blood and gore of a mafia hit, FOGETABOUDIT!"
"Quirky-","Null","0","0","26 January 2003"," Good, solid mob effort from Mike Newell
","Inevitably compared to Goodfellas, Mike Newell's 1997 effort, Donnie Brasco is just as good as Scorcese's film in many regards. The performances, including Johnny Depp as the title character and Al Pacino as his wretched wise guy pal, are flawless, with Depp great as the undercover FBI agent and Pacino in excellent form as Benjamin ¬ëLefty' Ruggiero. A less romanticised, more low-key look at mob life, Donnie Brasco follows Special Agent Joseph Piston, known to the mafia as Donnie Brasco, a friend of Lefty's who, unbeknownst to his mob friends, is collecting enough evidence to put them all away for many years. Too late, Lefty and his colleagues realise they've been had. Also coming to an overdue realisation is Joseph/Donnie who, too late, recognises his genuine affection for down and out Lefty and the predicament he's placed him in by befriending him. There are some justifications as to the Goodfellas comparisons, however: Bruno Kirby's Nicky sounds eerily like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito, even encompassing a similar kind of character. Moreover, the gaudy excess of Goodfellas is also on display Donnie Brasco, with the similar period setting and plot points (the bringing down of the mafia). However, the comparisons should probably end there, as they are two different films. In one of the funnier moments of the film (albeit, darkly humourous), Lefty (Pacino) laments to Donnie about being left out of the hit on their boss. This kind of tragicomedy also makes Pacino's character the more sympathetic of the two, I think. Lefty's greatest dream is to board a boat and escape his way of life. Although he underplays his role, Pacino still manages to overshadow every scene he's in. As a true story, it's also pretty fascinating; with the closing credits, we learn that the real Joseph Pistone, through his undercover work, ensured that 200 indictments and 100 convictions brought against the mob. An achievement for Pistone¬Öjust like the film is for Newell. 8/10"
"ntbond","Null","0","0","30 December 2002"," Don't read the book first
","Major Spoilers below<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy this movie, don't read the book on which it was based before watching. The book is a true story written by Joe Pistone - the real Donnie Brasco. The film purports to be based on it but the story is so mangled that it hardly bears any resemblence to Pistone's truth.<br/><br/>At no point in the book does Brasco witness a hit or be asked to cut up bodies. Whilst he's given the contract to whack Bruno in the book, as in the film, he never actually finds Bruno in reality so is not put in the position mentioned in the film. If you read the book, you'll realize that these are vitally important points as Pistone would have been in serious trouble with the FBI if he'd taken part in a hit. Also, Pacino's character Lefty was not killed in real life (as is implied in the film) but died years later from natural causes.<br/><br/>Also, Brasco's motivation is totally different. In the film, he tries to get Lefty to leave the mob but in the book he specifically says, several times, that he would never do this as it would be futile. In the film he feels guilty that Lefty will be killed by his actions but in the book he knows that Lefty would whack him if need be so feels no guilt. Also, generally, Brasco's character is much more violent in the film. Besides all this, there are also several major plot differences which just didn't happen in reality.<br/><br/>I can accept a certain amount of artistic licence when transferring from book to film as they are different forms of media. But, as I said above, this film bears little resemblence to the reality of the book and suffers greatly because of it. (unless, of course, Pistone left a lot of truth out of the book but, I guess, only he knows that!)"

","It is important to remember that in probably every gangster film, from the Public Enemy to Goodfellas, the anti- heroes are hugely likable characters who we easily gain empathy more. Al Pacino as Lefty is so convincing as an ignored foot soldier and world weary gangster, it is easy to see why joe/donnie likes him so much.  It continually amazes me that in the 90's, Pacino just by the gestures,postures, and voices he employed in his characterisations seemed to jump between ages. As frank slade he seemed like a washed up blind man, who to get out bed was a strain, whilst in the same year, as Carlito he seemed twenty years younger.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is another fine example of this. At times he seems as old as your grandad but always somehow manages to mix menace with pathos and humour. Donnie Brasco- the last great gangster movie.It not as magnificent as the godfather or as epic as Casino, but in it's portrayal of the insidous nature of the 'life'on even straight shooters like Depp it is unrivaled.

In most of his movies he is the star but that doesn't change the fact that he is first and foremost a character actor instead of a movie star who just basically plays himself every single movie.

A totally different character from The Godfather, no comparison in the two different acting styles. That's what makes Mr. Al Pacino such a great actor. His different acting approaches for his different projects. Johnny Depp gives a great performance in the role as the FBI agent. The scenes with Deep getting stressed out from the job are powerful. The last sense, when Pacino leaves his apartment, gives me some sad feelings. Although, he is in the Mafia and he has killed about thirty people, Pacino's acting is sad and so convincing; it makes me a little sad as well. Maybe because the people he has killed are in the Mafia and they know the consequences of being in that organization. You definitely feel at the end of the film the sadness of Johnny Deep's character. You can tell that he feels for Lefty (Pacino), and that he did become friends with him. Lefty knows that he is going to be killed because the FBI informed them that Depp was an undercover agent. I give this film * * * * (out of 5 stars)."

"krumski","Null","0","0","24 July 2001"," One of the best
","I've seen this movie three times now, and every time I've seen it I've come to like it *more*than the previous time - which is fairly incredible. I definitely liked it well enough the first time, but upon the third viewing I became convinced: this isn't just a good, solid movie - it's one of the greatest of all time.<br/><br/>Why? Well, for me, I'd say that ""Donnie Brasco"" is the movie that ""Goodfellas"" wasn't.  I don't actually get what the big fuss is over ""Goodfellas"" (which I realize, for many people, disqualifies my opinion right there, but here goes) - it's objective to the point of not taking any kind of stance at all on its characters or its situations. And even at that, in comparison with ""Donnie"" it actually *does* glamorize mobsters' lives: they are all the masters of their little world, and are entitled to the best of everything, even in prison.  By contrast, ""Donnie"" shows the cheap and petty underside of mob life: a bunch of frustrated grunts, hanging out in the local grease joint, hatching schemes to make any kind of buck in order to pay off their bosses. It's sad and pathetic - and the attempts of Pacino's character to puff himself up (as well as the life he leads) into some kind of mythic significance is just unutterably sad. It's the ""Death of a Salesman"" of mob movies. <br/><br/>And that in itself would be quite enough. But in fact, it's also something else, something equally gripping and profound. It's maybe the best ""undercover cop"" movie I've ever seen, as well.  That is, not only does it gives us a good inside view of the actual mechanics and legwork involved (wearing a wire, reporting to superiors, etc.) but also the effect that staying perpetually ""in character"" can have on the undercover cop's personal sense of self. Johnny Depp's character here is torn between his two separate identities: that of Joe Pistone, upstanding cop and family man, and the slimy and amoral ""Donnie Brasco"" that he is forced to live out every day as. His loyalty also becomes torn between his superiors, who stand loftily and sanctimoniously above him, and the everyday mob characters that he spends his time with and comes to feel a closeness for - particularly Lefty (Pacino). The relationship the movie builds between these two men is one of the strongest and most tender (while still understated) that I've ever seen in any film. And the conflict that it brings about in Donnie is made very real and poignant to the audience.<br/><br/>Also helping to make Donnie's dilemma effective are the scenes between he and his wife, played (perfectly) by Anne Heche. I bring this up because there might be a tendency to view these scenes as filler, since they take us away from the main action, and are pretty touchy-feely to boot (the quality of writing in them, I'll admit, is not as consistently high as the other scenes in the movie - though never less than competent). However,  I find them just as necessary and vital to the film as all the mafia stuff: those scenes add incalculably to the composite picture of Johnny Depp's character, and how it is being pulled this way and that by the call of duty and the pull of his heart and conscience.<br/><br/>A FINAL NOTE: Concerning Al Pacino's performance here; it's been lauded as one of his best, but I'm not so sure. The CHARACTER of Lefty is definitely one of the greatest he has ever been handed, but there's not much subtlety to his portrayal, i.e. it's of the hambone, ""Hoo-Ha"" variety that has become his stock in trade (""Sea of Love"" being the last time he created a fully three dimensional person on screen). However, what's affecting and poignant is how the film *uses* that portrayal: we're so used to seeing Pacino as the big boss, the head honcho - where his bluster is justified by his position - that to flip the formula on its head, and show him as the lowliest of the bottom feeders, yet still maintaining the same bluster, is tremendously jarring, in a sad kind of way. It's as if we're seeing the character of Lefty say to himself: ""I'm a nobody, but maybe if I puff up enough and carry myself more like Al Pacino does in the movies, I can become a somebody."" In this situation, is it the actor who's creating the magic, or the filmmakers' canny *use* of the actor, with all of his associations? I'm inclined to think the latter, but ultimately it doesn't matter: the bottom line is, Lefty Ruggiero is one of the greatest characters in all of film, and his story will break your heart.<br/><br/>A great, great movie. I'm sure I'll revisit it many more times through the years."
"Howlin Wolf","9","0","0","9 March 2001"," A mini masterpiece...
","Much as I like the classic examples of that particular film, when I first started to watch this I thought I might be getting a little tired of 'Mob expose' pictures. I was wrong.<br/><br/>Here you have two of the greatest actors in modern American cinema finally sharing a screen together. Boy do we get chemistry. Add to that the presence of an able supporting cast and a great script and you got the recipe for one heck of a film, and it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>It's very impressive that Mike Newell had previously directed ""Four Weddings..."" and then made this. Both are accomplished films but this definitely beats the earlier effort. The films are obviously very different but both are quality pictures and that's the mark of a good director. If you hated FW&AF then perhaps this little film will convince you that Newell can direct...<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Pacino has done this schtick countless times before and it seemingly never gets old, he's superb as usual. Depp matches him every step of the way and even overshadows him at some points, showing laudable restraint in difficult sequences that show him trying and failing to balance his home life with the requirements of his job. One outstanding scene has him forced into violence to keep up the charade of being a mobster. The expressions we see on his face perfectly capture the inner person who is disgusted at his actions and also the outward appearance of a man indulging his violent streak. Superb.<br/><br/>The pacing is perfect, the movie never feels rushed and plays out as you expect it would. This is not to say that the move is particularly predictable. I look at this more as a character study than a plot driven affair, and it is refreshing in a gangster movie not to be a mite confused about who's doing what to whom, a la ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"".<br/><br/>I wonder about the film stock that Newell used. The movie has a peculiarly grimy but not dark feel that aids the idea of Pistone going undercover perfectly. We are also treated to several interesting shots, as if the camera is a 'spy' itself, taking us right into the heart of Mob dealings. <br/><br/>Depp and Pacino were made to be on the same screen. More of them together please! The movie they and the director deliver is probably my favourite gangster flick, and it's up against some pretty stiff competition with the likes of ""The Godfather Trilogy"" and ""Casino"". Simply put: Brilliant film making."

","Goodfellas is still the undisputed gangster movie by which all standards are set, but DB is altogether slicker,even more brutal.  Depp is superb but is still outacted at every turn by a docile and almost dopey Pacino.  Pacino's calm makes his acts of violence seem much worse than they are (although the pool table scene is still pretty hard stuff.)  Overall I would have to reccommend the film to anyone who has even a passing interest in gangster movies and even those that dont will find something here as the film has humour, loyalty, betrayal and violence.  I dont say this often but this really is a must see movie."

","""Donnie Brasco"" is the true story of an FBI agent(Johnny Depp) whose job is to gradually infiltrate a lower, yet still quite dangerous, rung of the New York City mob in the 70s.  Masquerading around as ""Donnie Brasco, the Jeweler"", he gets the attention of Lefty(Al Pacino), a veteran mobster who knows he'll never get ahead in the mob again, and subconsciously wants to mentor a mob foreigner to bring purpose back into his life.  Lefty is enamored with Donnie, and isn't afraid to ""vouch"" for him to bring Donnie into his circle of the mob.  Soon Donnie becomes like another son to Lefty, and gradually gets to know his friends, including the ambitious Sonny Black(Michael Madsden).  Unfortunately his time on the job doesn't leave much for his wife Maggie(Ann Heche), who is tired of never having a husband around to support raising three children.  Furthermore, as he spends more and more time with Lefty's gang, Donnie proportionally loses his old identity and actually becomes ""Donnie Brasco"".  Saying more about the film would be time-consuming and wrong, since I only feel like I should give the basic meat of this very intriguing story and let anyone who hasn't seen it experience it for itself.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is of the highest caliber.  Al Pacino, of course, gives an unbelievable performance as Lefty, able to elicit a lot of sympathy and empathy from the viewer despite the viewer's knowledge of his ""26 hits"". It's clear that if his Lefty wasn't in the mob, he'd be your very admirable old next door neighbor, telling you stories and capturing your attention. From what I have read of reviews, people seem to be downplaying Johnny Depp's acting abilities.  I thought he did an amazing job, as the transformation from his real identity Joe to the cool Donnie Brasco is very visible and intriguing.  We know that he finds a lot more truth and meaning in the hectic and real mob life than in the impersonal bureaucratic FBI. When he says to his wife late in the film ""I can't breathe anymore"", we know exactly what he means: Joe is almost faded away, and Donnie the Quintessential Gangster's lifestyle is his own.  Also not to be written off is Micheal Madsden, who also did a tremendous job in Reservoir Dogs.  Hey Micheal, why'd you waste your time with Free Willy and not take Quentin Tarantino up on his offer to play THE Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction???<br/><br/>
A lot of people have written that this film forces a 70s vibe, but I don't think so at all.  Maybe I was too busy noticing Lefty's defeatist stare when he sees buddy Sonny shaking hands with ""The Boss"" he so wanted to please- scenes like that made the film for me, and they're sprinkled throughout to create a very well-done picture.  It does have some flaws, however.  The family scenes could have been a lot better done, and I have the feeling that a lot more about the mob could have been explained.  Oh well, I can't even express how much value I got out of this film, as I got it for free from the library.  Please take the time to watch it- it's an excellent glimpse of the life I think we all sometimes desire to live, and also an exploration of the great loving relationship of Lefty and Donnie.<br/><br/>Rating: Highly Recommended, 8.5/10"

","This excellent movie gives us another look at  the evil yet fascinating life of mobsters. ""Donnie Brasco"" shows us the mafia from the perspective of the title character, a perspective that changes as the film progresses; from the outside at first, then a slow u-turn to an insider's view. Pacino is superb in one of his few mob roles (the Godfather films may have typecast Al). I haven't seen Depp before, except in ""Edward Scissorhands."" He is a fine actor in this role, although he does seem a bit young to be the father of three children. The supporting cast is believable, particularly Bruno Kirby.

","Donnie Brasco is a film based on a true story about Special Agent Joseph Pistone (Depp) who infiltrates the Brooklyn mob element to clean up the streets. He must decide whether to put these people that he's become friends with in jail, or go down the same road they have and get trapped into a life of crime and violence. His mentor in this world, Lefty (Pacino), is an aging hitman and is really the only person he can trust¬Öand even though it's Brasco's job to take down people like Lefty, he becomes a true and valuable friend. Brasco must decide whether to take down this new found world as his job requires and betray those who trust him and those he's learned to respect, or succumb to the mob and betray his job.<br/><br/>It was a nice change to see Pacino play a character that I felt sympathetic towards, as his usual tough-guy roles leave little room for that. He plays a passed-up aging hitman with dreams of leaving the life of crime behind and never looking back. Both Depp and Pacino perform with respectable style as usual and the chemistry between them seems to work, even if it's not the duo you'd expect to see on screen together. Michael Madsen was also a joy to watch as the quick-tempered Sonny Black. He doesn't get many quality roles, so it was nice to see him here and he fit the role perfectly.<br/><br/>
Very Minor Spoilers:<br/><br/>My main reason for enjoying this film though would have to be for Pacino's character, Lefty. You just feel bad for the guy. He's been working for the mob for 30 years, just waiting to get the respect he deserves, but somehow has always been cheated out of. After making friends with him and gaining respect of the mob family, even Donnie and Sonny B. get offered opportunities that Lefty was more deserving of. It's easy to see why Lefty felt the way he did and wanted to leave that life, and start over. It simply wasn't worth it anymore.<br/><br/>Typically, I don't enjoy undercover style mob movies, but there are exceptions, and this is one of them. For example, Goodfellas was an awesome movie, up until the end. Even though it was based in a true story as well, it ticked me off when Henry Hill ratted out all of his lifetime friends and family to save his own hide and took a little enjoyment out of it for me. But with this movie, I felt it ended perfectly. My only qualm about the movie is how much they use the phrase `fogettaboutit'. It's already a clich√©, so why feed the fire? Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie and the performance therein. Overall 8/10."

","Donnie Brasco is one of my favorite films. The true life FBI story proved to be very captivating and the performances were excellent. Pacino should have secured an Oscar for his brilliant character role of 'Lefty' who is struggling to move ahead in the mob. I was also impressed with Johhny Depp's successful development of the Joe Pistone character who goes from a normal guy to a foul mouthed mobster. I've always thought that Depp, although not in a league near Pacino, is one of the most under-rated screen actors and this film is one of his better works. I thought the movie had a fresh and more sensitive approach to the mafia life, and the fact that it was a true story made it even better-of course taking into consideration the seriousness of the real life situations and consequences. It's a work of true art that brings depth back to the mafia genre."

Michael Madsen as Sonny Black is the best bad guy in film today.  He has that John Wayne quality going for him in this one.  Who could forget his equally stunning performance in Resevoire Dogs.

The on-screen chemistry between him and Pacino is amazing, and even though it is more focused on the relationship between Donnie (Depp) and Lefty (Pacino) than portraying life in the mob, it is, in my opinion, the finest mafia film since the Godfather part II."

","Donnie Brasco is certainly an entertaining film. I has that depth that, sadly, many films seem to lack. All the actors come together nicely and gel well, however it is Al Pacino who steals the show.<br/><br/>Playing a low-down mafia odd-job man, he sees his final chance to make an impact on the mob world. You really do feel for Pacino throughout the film. He longs to be a 'made-man'- a successful mafioso, but seems to be stuck low down on the ladder. His character is strangely pathetic- aging, and with a drug addict son. Even though he is a trouble making, gun toting, man hitting scumbag, you want him to be successful in what he does. A moral conflict without any doubt.<br/><br/>Just a short review then, but don't think that the film couldn't have had a long one. You really should see this film, if just for Al Pacino's character. I've heard more than one person get in a flap about historical inaccuracies, but for the average person (ie. you and me), don't worry. Very entertaining and thought provoking, and a worthy 8/10"

","A great cast including 3 of my personal favourite actors (Depp, Madsen, and Pacino) made my expectations of this film high. Other positive attention from people, critics, and not least the Oscars led me to expect a gangster film to rival The Godfather for the first time since Goodfellas. However, this it did not do. Although the acting wasn't bad, the script made it impossible for their characters to be taken seriously. One clich√©d attempt at recreating the aforementioned films after another made this tedious and cringe-worthy to watch - especially in light of the resumes of the cast. The fact that the film was based on a true story does give it credibility, and doubtless it may be a faithful version of the actual events considering the involvement of Pistone himself in the production. However, this does not excuse the fact that we are presented with one mob stereotype after another - regardless of how close to reality these stereotypes are. It may have worked as a tongue-in-cheek film along the lines of Wiseguys, but as a serious, emotionally affecting gangster film it fails. If you want a ""How To.."" guide in being a stereotypical Hollywood-style gangster, this is the film for you. If you're a fan of Depp, Madsen, Pacino, the gangster genre and good films as a whole - DON'T see this movie."

Pistone, an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco, aka, ""The Jewel Man"".It was directed by Mike Newell.<br/><br/>Joe Pistone is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero , a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime.However,as Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.It also drives a wedge between himself and his wife and children, and he realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly, Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend, and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates, he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself.<br/><br/>This is a first-class Mafia thriller.No question about it.First of all,the performances were nothing but spectacular.Pacino and Depp are a match made in acting heaven, riffing off each other with astonishing subtlety and wit.Also, is like a de-romanticized, de-mythologized version of The Godfather as it offers an uncommonly detailed, privileged glimpse inside the world of organized crime from the perspective of the little guys at the bottom of Mafia hierarchy rather than from the kingpins at the top. This not only one of the great modern-day gangster movies to put in the company of The Godfather films and GoodFellas, but it is also one of the great undercover police movies probably even surpassing Serpico and Prince of the City with respect to richness of character, detail, and moral complexity.In summary,it is a gangster movie that succeeds on all levels.Highly recommended indeed."

My opinion. No. Because it was his quality of family life, and normal life that suffered. I had heard the real Joe Pistone, tell quite a terrifying tale, which had him in another room, where two mafia guys were fifty fifty about him, and were having a discussion on whether to whack him, where Joe heard the whole tale. Now, put yourself in this situation, you can imagine. Depp, plays the real life Pistone, again to polished perfection, who went undercover as Don the jeweler, and was taken in by Lefty, (a feared mafia man, who becomes a pathetic pussy later on, as his status deteriorates, where Sonny (Michael Madsen, doing what he does best, smiling and looking intimidating with those mannerisms, we love) one of Lefty's gang, replaced him. It's really hard to rate Madsen's performance in this. The other two of Lefty's mob are played by Bruno Kirby and James Russo. Russo really surprised me actually. He's hasn't done work this good for a long time. Pacino as Lefty is just another masterpiece of a performance. I mean, what else can I say? He really carved out this real life character so deep, especially playing the pitiable part well, where Donnie seems to be his real only friend. Anne Heche is great as Depp's suffering wife, and is sexy too, as well as being a great actress. Violence wise, it's only violent when it needs to be, but when it happens, when the blood sprays, it's strong. In particular I'm taking about one scene, before human dismemberment, takes place. This is very smartly modified, as the visuals could of been much worse. Here's just another well told mafia tale, with great acting and writing. In contrast, bits of this one I familiarize with the current Black Mass, with Depp on the other end of the law.

","""Donnie Brasco"" is the name assigned to an undercover FBI agent who's assigned the task of infiltrating the New York mafia and ends up getting farther than anyone ever thought he would manage. Johnny Depp was quite good in the role - one of the few ""straight roles"" that I've seen him in, as opposed to the quirky style of character he usually seems to play. Depp had to play his character in two different settings - one as Brasco, the young mobster seeking to work his way up through the mob, and then as FBI agent Joe Pistone, who finds his mob life overtaking his personal life, to the point at which his marriage and family almost break apart under the strain. It was a fine piece of work by Depp, showing the character becoming almost overtaken by his mob persona, and steadily rising within the family to a level not even the FBI expected.<br/><br/>Al Pacino was the perfect partner for Depp in this. I don't think anyone could play the role of ""Lefty"" - a ""middle management"" mob type as well as Pacino. Lefty is a frustrated mobster, unable to advance in spite of many years of service, who recruits Brasco and then finds himself overtaken by the young newcomer to the ""family."" Pacino was completely believable in the role, as you would expect from such an accomplished actor. Depp and Pacino were teamed with a pretty solid supporting cast, the most notable of them being probably Anne Heche as Joe's long- suffering wife Maggie.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness in this was probably some poor pacing and structure in the first hour or so. It didn't seem to be fitting together all that well, and it actually seemed to start too abruptly, with Lefty trying to sell Brasco a diamond. How did Brasco get into that position in the first place? I wondered that all the way through. How did his undercover work begin? There also seemed to be a number of points at which Brasco should have been found out, but wasn't. Those points aside, though, this was a very entertaining movie."

He's a talented actor and very versatile, but I am very sick of him as Willy Wonka, Jack Sparrow, and coming soon as the Mad Hatter. Michael Madson and the rest of the cast were very good as well. <br/><br/>I did not like this film quite as well as Goodfellas, but that is not taking anything away from this. I would recommend both if you're interested in mob movies."

","""Posing as jewel broker Donnie Brasco, FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone (Johnny Depp) is granted entrance into the violent mob family of aging hit-man Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino). When his personal and professional lives collide, Pistone jeopardizes his marriage, his job, his life, and, ultimately, the gangster mentor he has come to respect and admire,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. The film is ""based on a true story,"" and begins its action in November 1978.<br/><br/>The old ""lawman infiltrating the gangsters"" storyline is really nothing new; but, Mike Newell's direction, and the great characterizations, are so good, you should become engrossed. Mr. Newell and writer Paul Attanasio focus on the relationship between young, upwardly mobile agent Depp and middle-aged Mafia middleman Pacino. Though there is, at least, one stomach churning (and vomit inducing) scene, ""Donnie Brasco"" is mostly a character study.<br/><br/>Depp is excellent as the young man who both poses as, and becomes ""Donnie Brasco""; you can see the ""Joe"" character succumb to, and struggle against, possession by the ""Donnie"" disguise. Pacino is also excellent; he struggles with his age, receding position in the ""family"", and realization he may have made the mistake of his life (in trusting Depp).<br/><br/>The relationship between Depp and Pacino is, perhaps, a little too vague. In my opinion, Depp sees Pacino's ""Lefty"" as a life he may have had, if luck and life had been different; and, Pacino sees Depp's ""Donnie"" as the failed promise of his lost youth. Depp and Pacino are award-worthy; and, Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are supporting standouts. Ms. Heche's role, as Depp's increasingly neglected wife, is especially important. She explains her distance well, ""I pretend I'm a widow."" <br/><br/>******** Donnie Brasco (2/28/97) Mike Newell ~ Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche, Michael Madsen"

A decently paced movie,you can sit and watch during your free time! No glamor. Depp at his best! Pacino at his Best! Very good work by cast and crew. A reality movie. Purely NewYorkie movie,need to catchup with the language. Some times things may get draggy,but movie is worth a watch.

","Donnie Brasco is the true (or at least mostly true) story of FBI agent Joseph Pistone undercover in the Bonanno crime family in the early 1980s. Exactly what you expect to happen in a mafia family does happen.<br/><br/>At first, the film was nothing special... the fact it was ""real"" meant that it had some of the more sensational things I have seen in other mob movies missing. But, this is made up for in the second half when Brasco gets to the higher ranks. So, if you are bored at first... wait it out.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is golden as always. He simply can do no wrong. Sure, you think ""Gigli"" sucked (and you are not alone in thinking this) but I will tell you that he was the crown jewel of that film (even more than my man Christopher Walken). In this film, he is a little more washed up than in other roles, but still very menacing in his own way.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp? Sure, he has made a mistake or two (I am still not sold on ""Secret Window"" or some of his later work with Tim Burton), but this is not one of them. Not only is he fantastic as Brasco, his acting is convincing enough that I might not even have recognized him as Depp if I was not aware of the fact. Well played, Mr. Depp.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen, a godsend. ""Trail of a Killer"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" are both Madsen goldmines, and this is another... ""Kill Bill"" a little less so. Ignore ""Free Willy"", it is films like this that Madsen really shines in.<br/><br/>Worth a watch if you like gangster films or historic films... or both, I guess. Quite a delightful piece of cinema."
"stoned_bunnies","10","1","2","10 June 2006"," Astounding and different
","I sat down to watch ""Donnie Brasco"" with the idea of a typical mafia movie in mind. When the movies was over, I decided that it wasn't exactly what you would label as, ""A typical mafia movie,"" because there is a whole side of the movie that involves, more than any Mafia movie does, a lot of sentimentality.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic and it is based on a true story. It's about an undercover agent for the FBI, Donnie Brasco, who joins the mafia in order to find information about it and completely infiltrate it. (Johnny Depp plays the undercover agent.) Donnie is practically adopted by Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), who is a lower-class Mafia man. Lefty guides Donnie through the New York gangster scene and they develop a very strong relationship. But as Donnie loses himself in his job, he becomes distant to his wife and kids. (The wife is played by Anne Heche). This causes problems with the family. Donnie turns into a confused, guilty, lost man as he goes on to mix his professional and personal life up and create one hell of a mess.<br/><br/>The story itself, I found very interesting. Then there's the perfectly chosen cast.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, there's nothing negative I can say about either Johnny Depp or Al Pacino in this movie. I've already decided that Johnny Depp is a generally a splendid actor (though a little too underplayed/subtle if that makes any sense at all), but I think that he did an exceptionally good job on this movie. I don't recall ever seeing him in a gangster movie, but he was in this one and he really captured the role and created a masterpiece of a character.<br/><br/>As for Al Pacino, he is most definitely on my Top 10 list of favorite actors, no doubt about that. And this movie only makes me think even more of him, so you can imagine how good he was. After having seen Donnie Brasco, I thought for the 100th time to myself, ""Al is untouchable."" The way he talks, walks, acts, laughs and moves with the other actors is simply astounding. He really makes you feel for him, which he hadn't been able to do since his classic performance in the ""Godfather Pt. II"".<br/><br/>Then comes Anne Heche. She used to be very popular around the '90s, and I was wondering what had happened to her. Well, now I know what happened to her. People got sick of Anne Heche. Her roles are never exceptionally challenging, and although she played a very believable role in this movie, her character wasn't a very powerful one. Many would disagree with me, but the whole concept of a wife scolding her husband every two scenes simply bored me and therefore the character became banal in my eyes. So although Heche did a good job in playing Donnie's wife, I'm not going to give her a standing ovation because she mostly annoyed me.<br/><br/>All in all, I would probably give this movie a 10/10."

","Donnie Brasco, Mob/Cop-Drama<br/><br/>In Johnny Depp's versatile repertoire, this stands as his Mobster movie. And like everything else he's done, it's done almost perfectly.<br/><br/>Donnie Brasco is based on a true story of an undercover FBI agent to who goes uncommonly deep into mafia circles to, of course, gather evidence of wrongdoings of in the world of organized crime. The film co-stars Al Pacino and Michael Madsen as mobsters who take a liking to Depp's Brasco, and eventually lead him deeper into mafia circles, doings, and evils. Anne Heche plays Depp's relatively angry wife.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--Obviously, as any film with Johnny Depp, the acting is very good. Pacino and Madsen roll along as convincing as ever in their roles as mobsters. Like they were born to play only these kind of parts.<br/><br/>--Excellent cinematography and very nice atmosphere.<br/><br/>--The brief gore we have is fantastic.<br/><br/>--A lot of snazzy rules discussed in detail about the underworld of Italian mobsters and their lingo.<br/><br/>--Excellent costumes. The story takes place in the late 70's, and the wardrobe and scenery is quite accurate.<br/><br/>--Giant 70's Cadillacs. What's not to like about that?<br/><br/>--Brilliant character depth and development, especially from Depp and Pacino's characters.<br/><br/>--Nice action sequences.<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br/><br/>--The music, aside from the Disco, is quite good.<br/><br/>--Occasionally, the pacing of the story seems a bit odd. This doesn't hurt the film, and won't be obvious to everyone, but to me, there seemed to be some ""off"" moments. <br/><br/>--Over two hours running time.<br/><br/>--Anne Heche must be going through menopause or something. One second she's happy, the next she's crazy, the next she's p*ssed off. Her acting was quite good, but her character was occasionally annoying. It worked to emphasize the growing problems in her relationship as Depp's wife.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--For some people, the pacing and length will be a turn-off. Some may become gradually disinterested in the film as it progresses.<br/><br/>--Aside from that, there isn't a whole lot to dislike here.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--Tons of Disco! Once again, what the hell was wrong with people in the 70's??<br/><br/>Memorable Scene:<br/><br/>--Hard to pick just one. I'll go with any time Depp's character slips over that line between undercover FBI agent and Mobster. For instance in the Japanese restaurant.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10 , Story: 9/10 , Atmosphere: 8/10 , Cinematography: 9/10 , Character Development: 10/10 , Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 (very minor, but good) , Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (brief breast shots only) , Violence: 6/10 (relatively brief, but very entertaining) , Gore: 1/10 (extremely brief, good quality) , Dialog: 9/10 (fagghettaboutit) , Music: 7/10 , Direction: 9/10 <br/><br/>Cheesiness: 1/10 , Crappiness: 0/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10 <br/><br/>Overall, I'd have to recommend this, especially to Johnny Depp fans, and fans of Mafia/Mobster movies.

"Alex-Tsander","7","1","2","14 April 2005"," A solid gangster movie allegedly based on fact.
","A very entertaining movie. But I am unsure whether the things I find entertaining about it were deliberate or unintentional.<br/><br/>For a start, there's Pacino's character. All the way through the show I could not help thinking that he was parodying his own gangster clich√©s, speech, body language, etc. A self-parody in fact. Or was that unintentional.<br/><br/>Then the ""gags"". For example, when Depp and Pacino sneak along the quayside and depp hears the click of Pacino's gun behind him and stops suddenly. This for me has a slap-stick quality about it and actually made me laugh. Was this deliberate or what?<br/><br/>The man with the ""voice-box"" is a walk-on clich√©. Surely an intentional gag. Or was it?<br/><br/>Michael Madsen, by comparison to Pacino, just plays out his one-role clich√© style of ""acting"" that is certainly not self-parody but is totally risible. Are we meant to laugh at his stereotyped performance?<br/><br/>Then the Mormon FBI boss. Certainly his objection to swearing is a clever way of conveying his small mindedness. But it is also blackly comic.<br/><br/>Then there is the serious aspect of the film. The scene in the counsellors office is hilarious. But it also brings home the irony of the Depp character's position. The more he adopts the ""mask"" of his mob persona, in fact the more real a person he actually becomes. This was, for me, the most intriguing aspect of the story ( as it is told in this version ). However, it is not developed in any systematic way.<br/><br/>The more Depp's character falls out of the family-man role the more I found myself disliking his wife. She chose to marry an FBI agent, then crucifies him for doing the job. Is it any wonder if he flies into the quasi-homosexual emotional bond that develops between him and ""Lefty"".<br/><br/>This is of course the bottom-line of the story ( no pun intended ). How loyalty and an emotional tie can develop even towards someone who, frankly, is as bad a serial murdering thug as any of them in the movie. In spite of what we know about him, such as his admission to involvement in killing at least 26 of his ""buddies"" in the mob, the scene where it comes to his turn to take the walk and he strips off his meagre jewellery,depositing his bits in a drawer with a five buck bill, is still very moving.<br/><br/>Depp emotes very understatedly in the last scene, expressing silently his disgust at the paltry medal and five hundred dollar cheque that were the pay-off for a mans life."
"dr_foreman","10","1","2","23 January 2004"," not your average mobster movie
","I have no particular interest in mobsters or their movies, but I make an exception for ""Donnie Brasco.""  I'm a sucker for true stories, and this is one of the wildest ones out there; I can hardly believe that an FBI agent so effectively infiltrated the mob, but apparently he did, and it makes for great drama.<br/><br/>There's a bit of everything in this movie.  We see Agent Pistone's developing relationship with hit-man Lefty (played to perfection by a hilarious Pacino), his domestic troubles, and his struggle to stay connected with the FBI as his fellow agents keep letting him down.  There's even a lion thrown in the mix for good measure; can you beat that?<br/><br/>Although there are mobster trappings all over this movie, it's essentially a compelling story of friendship and betrayal that would work even without the guns and slang and seedy New York locales.  Unlike so many other movies, it doesn't rely on criminals being intrinsically fascinating; it makes them fascinating with genuine character development.  And that's what won me over."
"rupie","8","1","2","24 June 2003"," superb
","Definitely a movie that bears rewatching, Donnie Brasco, is - as the consensus of opinion here says - among the top rank of mob films, right up there with the Godfather epic, and certainly superior to the cheap, flashy and overrated ""Goodfellas"". I would say the character development and moral ambiguity in this movie is even more well-developed than in the Coppola movies. To repeat yet again what has been noted below many times, the venerable Al Pacino is at his best and Johnny Depp shows his chops as one of our best young actors, and the way they work together is one of the most superb instances of screen chemistry. Multi-faceted, gritty, realistic, touching, suspenseful - this movie is not to be missed."

","Infiltration of the mob by a young FBI agent (Johnny Depp) leads to fireworks in this impressive little film from 1997.

The strong relationship between Depp and criminal Al Pacino is at the heart of this smart motion picture that works due to a clever Oscar-nominated screenplay and top-flight performances by the key players involved. Based on actual events ""Donnie Brasco"" is one of the more impressive films of 1997. 4 stars out of 5."

","Hollywood has produced a number of classic gangster pictures, but this is unique because it shows the nickel-and-dime guys at work, and how sad it is that some of them think they have it so great.  In the relationship between Donnie and Lefty, it also brings in a DEATH OF A SALESMAN tone, which is also well done.  Pacino, of course, has a good history with the gangster, having played Michael Corleone, and here, he brings the same ability and restraint to someone 180 degrees from Corleone.  You may hate what Lefty does, but you won't be able to stop thinking about him.  And Depp matches Pacino point for point in this, his first real adult role.  Credit should also go to director Newell and writer Paul Attanasio for the authentic feel this movie has.  The only complaint I have is Anne Heche (a wonderful actress) is wasted on the role of Donnie's wife, since it's a nothing part."

","For many years after I watched Donnie Brasco, I longed for the type of technology that could extract the film from my brain. Fortunately, years have passed since, and unfortunately, other more disturbing movies have taken its place in my mind as movies I wish I'd never seen. If you're a sensitive person who gets seriously upset by gritty, upsetting true crime stories, don't watch Donnie Brasco, no matter how famous you think it is.<br/><br/>As a young film student, I was pressured into watching this movie by my male peers. This is a very masculine film, with no redeeming qualities for female viewers. It's the true story of an undercover FBI agent, played by Johnny Depp, who gets so immersed in his assignment that he loses touch of who he really is. His assignment is to join the mafia and get close to head mafioso Al Pacino, and while it's understandable that Al is magnetic and alluring, the audience is constantly aware that this is a true story. The killings and the choices and the danger are real, unlike many ""gangster pictures"" that glorify street violence. To me, that made all the difference in the world. One might say that the film, and all the people involved, must have been excellent for me to have such a negative reaction. Frankly, I don't care. There was no purpose in this ""expos√©"" for me; I can't wage a one-woman campaign against mob violence, nor do I have the opportunity to stop anyone in my environment from joining such a crowd. It was merely upsetting, and I wish I'd never watched it.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","3","27 June 2016"," Unusual gangster story works very well
","At once a worthy and intelligent gangster tale, with less emphasis on extreme violence and melodrama than previous offerings in the genre. This is a character-led drama which draws excellent performances from both Johnny Depp and Al Pacino as the cop and seasoned criminal who become unlikely pals during the course of the film. The supporting players are also good - particularly Michael Madsen, on hand to play yet another sociopath - but it's Depp and Pacino who the film belongs to. Depp gives an ambitious, multi-layered performance of a cop torn between his duties and his loyalty for his new friend, while Pacino is surprisingly restrained and different to his normal persona.<br/><br/>Of course, there are still the typical gangster trappings, such as the dismemberment of a corpse in a basement cellar and the systematic beating of a Japanese waiter in some toilets, but this is a film more about people than anybody else. As the inevitable conclusion draws closer, the suspense level rises to an unbearable level and there's a powerful, upsetting conclusion to prepare for. A gripping, involving piece of mature entertainment."

While the film starts out very promising with the bonding of Pacino and Depp and some good nuts and bolts gangster action, the whole thing soon becomes trivialized and ultimately destroyed by a pointless domestic storyline that keeps eating away at the main narrative like termites, before consuming it utterly in the final reels. An unromantic take on Mob life is a refreshing departure from what we are usually fed. Very matter of fact and business-like killings, and penny ante heists more accurately reflect the day to day life of a wise guy if this is movie is accurate. Depp and Pacino might be said to red line the NY accent, but they don't. Born bred NYers talk like this and worse.

Donnie Brasco is in a jungle where he does not belong, yet he must somehow push himself to fit in with the hollow sociopaths around him... Even at the cost of his own family. He is a true hero, not chivalrous, but doing what is necessary at great sacrifice to himself and those he holds dear... And yet there is no reward for him in the end, no glory to behold. He's just another cog in the machine, more meat for the meat grinder, but at least he made the world slightly brighter.<br/><br/>What this film does particularly well is its ability to demonstrate that in the ecosystem of organized crime, values such as honour, compassion, civility, and honesty are weaknesses-not strengths.

Only to be starkly reminded that for the monsters inhabiting this dark underbelly of society, they will gut him like a fish should he reveal himself as a human being walking among them.<br/><br/>This film has excellent performances by its entire cast and good direction... My main criticism is that the ending feels a bit abrupt, and left me with the feeling there should have been more explanation for the aftermath of the events transpired. It almost feels tired, but maybe that was the whole point all along."

","To start, the pace of the movie and the acting (specially Al Pacino, Depp and Madsen) for me were very good. It is one of the movies that will leave you wanting to know what is going to happen next as Depp (Donnie Brasco) starts to get himself deeper and deeper in the mafia life leaving his own family on the sidelines. However, this movie has its flaws. Although the writing is very good there are some moments that leave you thinking why the mob did not investigate Donnie Brasco deeper before getting him involved w them? I mean, they could have very well just followed this guy to find out he had a family living right there not too far away. This is a true story so Im sure the mob did do their research at the time but this is not shown in the movie. I just do think they could have explored that a little more.
Also the duality of Depp's character is great and will leave you wondering. I mean this guy was neglecting his own family to serve his country but also starting to like some of the people in the mob (Lefty, Al Pacino's character) to the extent that he couldnt leave anymore or this guy would be killed. It's interesting and it did make a great movie in the end. Although its not perfect, I enjoyed it and definitely recommend."

","It's been a long time since I read Joseph Pistone's story in the book ""Donnie Brasco"", but I can still recall three essential elements that kept recurring throughout his story. They had to do with the principal fears Pistone had while working undercover for the FBI. The first obviously was being found out, which would have meant curtains for him. That would have immediately brought recrimination by the Mob against his sponsor Lefty for bringing him into the Family. And there was one other element that didn't get singled out specifically in this film, Pistone's qualms about what he would do if he was actually ordered to perform a hit on someone. I remember his wrestling over the idea that if the hit was ordered on another mobster whether he would do it or not, since they were all bad guys and the victim would have deserved it in line with the Mafia code of honor. As it is, I don't think he was ever asked to perform one.<br/><br/>Now I don't know about anyone else, but while watching this picture and knowing that it was based on a true story, you had to give unparalleled credit to the real life Joe Pistone for his ability to infiltrate the Mob under circumstances that could have been a career ending move. He must have had nerves of steel to balance his gangster life with his real identity and home life, which as we saw began to unravel as time went on.<br/><br/>After experiencing Johnny Depp in any number of identity altering movie roles, and seeing him here as agent Pistone, alias Donnie Brasco, it doesn't even look to me like Depp in the role. Pretty weird if you think about it. As for Pacino, he's quite good as a small fish in a big pond so to speak, a gangster with twenty seven hits to his credit who looked like he wouldn't hurt a fly except for the tough talk and wise guy demeanor. His frustration at not rising higher in the Family ranks is given palpable resonance in the story, yet he never overstepped his superiors or demanded more for his loyalty.<br/><br/>As far as gangster films go this is a good one, and without the typical type bloodshed one might expect from a story like this. There's some of that of course but it doesn't overwhelm the senses like some flicks do. Among the seventy or so gangster films I've seen and reviewed here on IMDb, this one ranks in the upper tier."
"stones78","Null","0","1","15 October 2015"," Very good, but some flaws too
","This slightly different mafia film has several familiar faces, including Al Pacino, Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby, and Anne Heche, with Pacino giving the best performance as the down-on-his-luck mobster Lefty Ruggiero, who is responsible for introducing Agent Joe Pistone(Depp)into the mob. The best moments were the interactions between the 2 great actors, Pacino and Depp, as they were both very believable in their roles. I thought they both followed the factual book by author Pistone rather well. On the other hand, I felt that Sonny Black's character(Madsen)could've been developed a bit more than just a secondary character; in the book, he's just as important as Lefty, maybe more than that. Without spoiling too much, the ending of the book is very different than the film's convenient ending, in regards to Lefty and Sonny's fate. I got slightly bored when Pistone had arguments with his wife Maggie, played by Heche, as it slowed the film down. Other than those aspects I just mentioned, I still find this a very solid mafia film, but not a great one."

","Donnie Brasco (1997): Dir: Mike Newell / Cast: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche, Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby: Containing not a shred of originality and looks like every other gangster film. Johnny Depp plays Donnie Brasco, an undercover cop getting caught up in the crime. Graphic scene includes bodies being sawn up. Conclusion is pretty obvious. Director Mike Newell is aided by good locations. Depp is in fine form as Brasco drawn into crime without regret or acknowledgement. Al Pacino is in his right element as a mob boss who takes in Brasco like a son until certain facts eventually surface. Anne Heche plays Brasco's wife who struggles to maintain his true identity but unfortunately the role is pretty predictable and one note . Michael Madsen is typecast as a mobster. He was great in this sort of role in Reservoir Dogs but here he is doing nothing new. In fact nothing about the supporting roles uphold any belief that this is anything other than a routine gangster film. It is a who's who in gangster casting and it is a weak element in the film. Formula and clich√© with superb climax. It is well crafted but contains all the elements seen in countless other films of its kind. It is the performances by Depp and Pacino that make this outing better than it might have been in lesser hands. This is what you call a glorious familiarity, or perhaps everybody shares the same story in the mob. Score: 7 / 10"
"Red-Barracuda","6","0","1","4 March 2015"," Solid but middling Mafia movie
","This gangster film is based on a true story that occurred in the late 70's. An undercover FBI agent goes under the moniker of Donnie Brasco, a jewel expert from New York. He soon finds favour with an aging mob hit-man called Lefty Ruggiero. Under his wing, he discovers the ways of the Mafia. The older man sees Donnie as someone he can trust and who he can help with his street wisdom. Donnie, in turn, finds himself slowly turning into the gangster he is pretending to be.<br/><br/>On the surface this is another mafia movie but it's more about the relationship between the two protagonists than anything else. As Donnie rises in the mob, Lefty is left behind; while the FBI agent has to deal with the knowledge that if he is successful in his objective he is effectively putting a death sentence on his friend. So the themes of loyalty and betrayal are strong. At the same time both men experience marriage difficulties on account of their lifestyles, so this operates as a domestic family drama too, as well as a look at the small details of mob life. Johnny Depp is okay in the title role but in the main he is surprisingly bland and uninteresting; Al Pacino on the other hand, is very good as a beaten down unglamourous gangster, who is a far less assured character than the ones he plays in most of his other starring roles in crime films. The movie as a whole is a solid but not upper bracket addition to the Italian American crime film sub-genre. Although, it's true life origins do give it something extra."

","This drama about an undercover cop who learns the hidden dangers of working his way inside the mob was based on a true story. Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who is given an assignment to infiltrate the Mafia; calling himself Donnie Brasco, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters. Lefty's marriage is falling apart, his son is a junkie, and his health is failing, which only adds to his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years with the Mafia (and killing 26 people) with little to show for it. But in Donnie, Lefty sees someone who can succeed where he failed; he takes the young man under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly rises through the ranks of organized crime; however, the longer he plays the role of the gangster, the more Joe Pistone finds himself becoming Donnie Brasco in his increasingly rare off hours; it drives a wedge between himself and his wife (Anne Heche) and children, and Joe realizes that a break in character among the hoodlums he's come to know could mean a death sentence for himself and his family. Just as importantly, Joe has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend, and Joe realizes that when the day comes where he has to turn in his Mob associates, he'll be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he put a slug in his head himself. The supporting cast includes Michael Madsen as Sonny, Lefty's boss, and Bruno Kirby as Nicky, one of Sonny's henchmen. The real-life Joe Pistone today lives under an assumed name with a 500,000-dollar contract on his life still in effect."

But the movie basically shows all its cards early on. I would probably consider not revealing the FBI undercover story or have their bosses push them harder. Something is needed to drive up the tension. The movie just doesn't translate the danger onto the screen. Director Mike Newell really needs to amp up every cinematic opportunity to represent danger. For example, Donnie finds a picture of their Miami boat in a magazine on the plane. A more compelling scene would have somebody almost picking up the same magazine or even pick up that magazine. True or not, the director needs to pump up the tension."

","Due to his long term Collaboration with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp name is mostly highlighted next to films which bare the Disney indent. However he has acted in films targeted at a older demographical group and Donnie Brasco is one of those films.<br/><br/>One word of advice, if your expecting a full blown Mafia film then this film will upset you. We follow the true story of a FBI agent who for Six years, is thrown in the deep end of the Mafia , participating as a undercover cop. The pairing of Depp and Pacino is fantastic with Pacino as always being top dog. However, if your thinking his character Lefty is at the calibre of Michael Corleone or Tony Montano, they you would be very mistaken. Instead, we witness a man whom looking over his shoulder 24/7, afraid of being whacked. A man who has pipe dreams like the rest of us. Despite his Mafia history, you engaged in some sort of supportive connection with Pacino character and hope at the end that things will work out fine for him.<br/><br/>With his one liners and old dog's tales, He steals the show. Depp with him only helps the pairing to be even more enjoyable. It still has the night clubs and the 70's soundtrack.

In this case it is Pacino, doing his usual crime boss shtick. Despite the claims about being based on a true story, it is hard to believe that a fresh-faced cop like Depp would be able to fool so many hardened criminals.

","In 1997, two of the screen's greatest actors, Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, got together and made the true story of undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, whose alias was ""Donnie Brasco,"" which is the film's title. It's not a movie you hear a lot about, as it probably got lost among the plethora of post-Godfather mob films. However, it's well above average for the cast and characterizations.<br/><br/>Pistone risks everything to get in with the mob, attaching himself to Lefty (Al Pacino). Lefty isn't a big boss - he's a middleman, the one who takes all the risks and continually is passed over for promotion. He takes Donnie under his wing, teaches him the lingo, how to dress, etc. All the while, Donnie is meeting his FBI boss for coffee and passing him information. As Donnie gets in deeper and deeper, his harried wife (Anne Heche), who rarely sees him, becomes disgusted. He is constantly disappointing his children. Soon he begins to identify with the mob, even speaking like them, more than he identifies with the FBI. And he realizes that once he comes out of the mob, Lefty, who brought him in and with whom he has a bond, will be murdered.<br/><br/>Pacino and Depp are extraordinary together and give fantastic performances. Pacino isn't the powerful don as Michael Corleone was; he's a worker bee who takes orders. One feels sorry for where his life has gone. Depp's Joe is badly treated by the FBI - his frustration, anger, and confusion over his own feelings are apparent. They both elevate this film.<br/><br/>Anne Heche does a terrific job as Joe's unhappy wife, who adores him nevertheless, and Michael Madsen is great as a big boss with more temper than brains.<br/><br/>Mike Newell directs ""Donnie Brasco"" well, showing us the mean, depressing streets of New York, and the violence and stress of mob life, where your best friend can be the one who takes you out. It's not a glamorized picture of either the Mafia or the FBI. In fact, the two organizations have a lot in common. They're both lousy to their employees."

A relationship that as longs as it runs for, is likely to get them, or someone they love, killed.<br/><br/>Directed by Mike Newell and starring Johnny Depp {Brasco} and Al Pacino {Lefty}, Donnie Brasco is adapted from the true story novel written by Pistone himself called My Undercover Life In The Mafia. Choosing not to go the operatic Scorsese way with a Mafia topic, Newell instead goes for a sort of grim realism, something that in an oxymoron way makes this one of the freshest ""Gangster"" pictures of the modern era.<br/><br/>Tho this is very much an actors piece {both Depp and Pacino deliver royally good and complimentary performances}, the credit to Brasco's quality should probably go to Paul Attanasio and his screenplay. Choosing to make it a tight character study over violent bravado histrionics, Attanasio's adaption could never stand charge of glamorising the thugs. Sure there's violence, and the usual array of wise-guy nastiness dots its way throughout the piece. But it's the central relationship between Donnie and Lefty, that coupled with the strain evident on Pistone's home life, that keeps the film afloat.<br/><br/>Of course there is the obvious problem of knowing that our intrepid undercover agent could pull out at any time, so in that where does Newell and Attanasio gain their tension and sense of danger from? We know Pistone lives, he wrote the book and told the tale, so with a slight trick of the hand, the makers make us wonder who else is going to be in the pain zone here. And this includes Lefty since his bond {and vouching for} with Brasco is tender, perhaps even sad? Thus lifting him away from your stereotypical movie gangster. Perhaps Pistone's family will suffer? The marriage is crumbling as Donnie goes deeper, is there a sting in the tail coming there? And on it goes, we may just be following these two guys on their path to reckoning {the film does suffer when they are not together on screen}, but the tension and wondering is palpable in the extreme.<br/><br/>With a fine supporting cast of Michael Madsen, James Russo, Brunno Kirby and the badly formed Anne Heche, the film is served well in the acting department.

","Donnie Brasco (1997)<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>A different type of Mafia movie centers on the relationship between an undercover FBI agent (Johnny Depp) and the older, somewhat ordinary gangster (Al Pacino) who never really was special enough to move up in the ranks. DONNIE BRASCO isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it's certainly an intense, highly entertaining and at times thought-provoking film that manages to have many strong points. There's no question that the strongest is the relationship between the two men and this is perfectly brought to life thanks to the terrific performances by the two leads. By this point in his career Pacino could play a gangster in his sleep but the character of Lefty is certainly something very different than what we've seen from him in the past. The most noticeable thing is that this guy is pretty much a sad loser. There's really nothing special about him and I really loved the low quality that Pacino brings to him. There's just a certain sadness that floats around this guy and Pacino simply nails the role. Depp is just as impressive as the undercover agent who quickly finds himself becoming like the men he's spying on. The relationship and chemistry between the two actors is simply wonderful and certainly carries the picture. There's also strong support from the likes of Michael Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche. What I enjoyed most outside the performances was the fact that the movie also has a good sense of humor. There are some very intense moments scattered throughout the picture and especially the constant fear of one of the two leads getting killed but there are also some clever bits of comedy thrown in. The late 70's and early 80's setting is also perfectly captured by director Mike Newell who also manages to keep the film moving at a very good pace. With so many gangster movies out there it's sometimes hard to find one that gives us a new and fresh look at the subject. DONNIE BRASCO does that and it's certainly one worth watching."

","Lets face it, all of the best gangster movies were all made before the '90's. That however doesn't mean that some good gangster movie are stopped being made. ""Donnie Brasco"" is such a good movie, that's a typical gangster movie with most of the usual ingredients, with as an extra touch some drama added to it.<br/><br/>Perhaps that the movie tries to be a bit too dramatic at times. Some moments feel too forced and fabricated, just to enhances the movie its dramatic moments. It's just not always interesting and distracts from the movie its main plot. Still lot of things work out, such as the growing sympathy, from Donnie Brasco/Joseph D. 'Joe' Pistone for the small time gangster Lefty, who has never really made it- and gets drawn into the gangster-life. But lots of things also don't. Such as the whole plot with Pistone's wife and children. <br/><br/>The main story is good and compelling. Its all the more interesting since its a true story. Its a typical gangster movie story that is solidly written, with all of the much needed ingredients and characters in it. Genre fans will most definitely be not disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is as great as you would expect from him, in a this sort of movie. Johnny Depp also suits his role well. James Madesen also plays a rather big role in the movie but I don't know, he sort of feels out of place in a this sort of gangster movie. Works for Tarantino movies but just not the 'Scorsese type' of movies, so to speak. Further more the movie also has Paul Giamatti and Tim Blake Nelson in small roles, before they were really known.<br/><br/>Too bad that at the time of its release this movie never really got the praise it deserved. The people mostly ignored the movie, myself included. Luckily now more and more people start to 'rediscover' this movie and are given it the praise it deserves. For ""Donnie Brasco"" is a well made gangster movie, that perhaps was made at the wrong time, when the gangster genre was already presumed death and dried up. It's the same reason why ""Casino"" failed. Who knows, if this movie was made in the '70's, people might regard it as a classic by now.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"rajdoctor","7","0","1","19 August 2007"," Donnie Brosco
","This movie was recommended to me and I saw it because of that.<br/><br/>It is based on a true story of a FBI undercover agent Donnie Brasco (Johny Depp) who infiltrates the underworld and mafia by taking into confidence a second in-command Benjamin ""Lefty"" (Al Pacino). The trust both of them build in each other pushes Donnie to a point of being a mafia himself and associating in many crimes the gang commits. There is a power struggle of their team leader Sonny Black (Michael Madsen) who over-throws their rival gang and senior boss to become a leader. It is in the end that they realize Donnie is an undercover agent, which leads to them killing Benjamin. There is a parallel plot running of problems faced by Donnie Brasco in his family life due to the kind of job he is handling.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me a lot of Departed. Surely a part of Departed story is lifted from Donnie Brasco with additional angle of undercover mafia in police is added.<br/><br/>But Donnie Brasco excels solely on its story and screenplay. It is honest, tight and gripping. One remains glued to the seat till the very end. Al Pacino performs the role of Lefty with such a punch and marvelous acting that puts him in the top bracket of best Hollywood actors. Johny Depp is good, but this was not his best performance.<br/><br/>The Director Mike Newell (who took almost 30 years to make his first movie after his debut as TV director) does a very good job in direction.<br/><br/>The story had drama and thrill in it. There were only two shooting or violent scenes in the whole movie yet one felt on the seat at every moment. That was the difference between good cinema and today's violent cinema that is sadly considered good.<br/><br/>It shows that one can depict a mafia story with all the thrills and chills even without showing crude violence and shootings.<br/><br/>(Stars 7.5 out of 10)"

","Finally, after 10 years, I watched Donnie Brasco. And that was the kind of experiment where you ask yourself ""shit! How can it be that I didn't heard of this movie before??"" To resume, Donnie Brasco tells the (true!)story of a special FBI agent, Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp), who infiltrated the New York Maffia at the end of the 70s. He becomes friends with Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino), who let him slip into wheels of the organization around Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), lately with the rank of chief of Brooklyn. Ruggiero and Pistone (under the name of Donnie Brasco) become close whereas the group leaves to collect money for the boss. During all this time, Pistone collects evidences, photographs and audio tapes. But his investigation becomes more than that, whereas it also put in danger his marriage, his family life, his safety and his own life. As he makes his place in the Maffia group, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to freely communicate with the outside world, until he even has to cut its bond with the FBI during weeks whereas the Maffia suspect a rat in the organization. But the true dilemma to Pistone is that if he leaves his character and the Maffia, Ruggiero will be punished for letting Pistone coming in and helping him to integrate the organization¬Ö One of the best Maffia movies I saw, Donnie Brasco was in nomination for the Best screenplay Oscar in 1998. Also, one of the best Al Pacino performances. And, according to the ""making of"" featurette included on the DVD, Johnny Depp really discussed with Joe Pistone and tempted to imitate not only his actions, but also his attitude, his step, his way of expressing himself and his nonchalance. Michael Madsen is also really brilliant in the role of Sonny Black. All the gangster activities are fascinating and we really want to know how they will find the rat.<br/><br/>Really excellent, very good suspense, brilliant performances by the actors¬Ö It is just really strong! (For those which already watched it, I really hoped that Johnny Depp would not carry this mustache all the way through film!)"

","When I heard about the main actors in this film, I was already sure that it had to be good; with names like Al Pacino and Michael Madsen, you can't go totally wrong. Johnny Depp is also pretty good, in some films, this definitely being one of them. I have to admit, not having seen too many good gangster films, I was very excited to see this, considering the great names in the cast, and the promising commercials I saw for it. It was really a great movie; the whole atmosphere of the gangster world, organized crime, was perfectly captured in the movie. The ""wiseguys"" acted, talked and moved like gangsters. The plot is very interesting and captivating, and it moves along at a great pace, considering the length of the movie. It keeps your interest for the duration of the film, as it develops almost constantly. The actors all do terrific jobs, especially the three main actors. The characters are well-written and their actions are entirely credible. The cinematography is pretty good, especially when depicting violence, as it really has the effect on you that the director obviously wanted it to. All in all, a great movie about the mob and the whole environment, but it could have been slightly better. You know too little of the gangsters' intentions and motivations, which makes it too difficult to relate to anyone else than Johnny Depp's character, and his wife's character. I recommend this to anyone who's interested in the environment of the world of organized crime, who likes dramas. I also recommend it to any fans of Depp, Pacino or Madsen. 8/10"
"arunbristol","10","0","2","18 March 2004"," A great gangster movie
","Donnie Brasco starring Al Pacino and Johnny Depp is nothing short of mesmerising. The story line may have been tested and tried over the years at Hollywood, alias Scarface and Goodfellas, however this movie is slightly different. The movie is about an undercover FBI agent who needs to bust a local New York gang. Depp plays the role of the FBI agent and Al Pacino that of a gangster. Depp is great as the undercover agent and Pacino is his usual best when it come to movies of crime and cocaine. The perspective of a FBI agent on gangsters life has never been tried in Hollywood that is what makes this movie unique. Great movie especially for lovers of gangster genre."
"counterrevolutionary","7","0","1","19 March 2003"," Save the book for later (SPOILERS)
","I might have enjoyed this film more if I hadn't read and enjoyed the book by Agent Pistone. It's very well-made, Pacino's performance is outstanding, and even Madsen and Depp (not my favorite actors) are adequate.<br/><br/>I understand the necessity for dramatic license, and I'm not in the habit of nitpicking small details (e.g., much of the relationship between Lefty and Donnie was in fact based on Donnie's relationship with Sonny Black, and I appreciate the reasons for the change). In this case, however, the changes alter the very spirit of the story, and the original story was better. Apparently, the story of a cop heroically risking his life for what he knows is right is beyond the understanding of cynical Hollywood filmmakers; in their hands, it becomes a story of a cynical FBI agent driven by his cynical bosses into the loving arms of the mob.<br/><br/>And what makes it even worse is that the film actually portrays low-level mob life accurately as Pistone actually saw it. These guys are pathetic, sleazy, money-grubbing lowlifes, constantly afraid that their bosses will decide to have them ""whacked,"" generally over a few dollars. It's possible to believe that an ordinary person with decent career prospects could be attracted to mob life as portrayed in THE GODFATHER. But this? Fugeddaboutit!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Not that they made this stuff up out of whole cloth. Pistone himself admits that he really liked Sonny Black and felt bad when he found out that he had been killed. But he never indicates that he considered taking any other action. He also admits that, although his moral attitudes and mannerisms didn't change, he did pick up a certain combativeness and unwillingness to back down from confrontation.<br/><br/>The end of the film would definitely have been more enjoyable if I hadn't known the real story. Lefty's death in the movie was based on the real-life end of Sonny Black. I understand the poignancy of giving Lefty the big ""getting called in"" scene at the end, but the real-life story is better. ""Lefty Guns"" Ruggiero, lowlife sleazeball that he was, never talked. He upheld his twisted code of honor, even when the feds offered to keep him out of prison (he served ten years thanks to Pistone's testimony) and protect him against his former associates. When he was dying of cancer, the money-grubbing weasel reportedly turned down $1,000,000 to promote this movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to be unfair to someone like Benjamin Ruggiero, but this film manages it.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the film (or even if you don't, but are interested in what mob life is really like), be sure to read the book to learn the true story.<br/><br/>7/10."

"drjimmy11","Null","0","2","6 August 2002"," I know Ray Liotta, i've seen Ray Liotta...
","and Johnny Depp you're no Ray Liotta. From the first moment he appears on screen his character is just plain boring. He never gives us any clue why we should be interested in him, he looks like a dork and has no charisma at all- miles away from what Liotta did in ""Goodfellas.""<br/><br/>Of course the script isn't doing him any favors. Why is this guy a cop? He seems to enjoy being a mobster a lot more. All the cops in the movie are stupid, out of touch losers and the mobsters are cool- just like in most mob movies- except most are told from the mob POV, not the FBI's. Normally it's a guilty pleasure to root for the bad guys and we can all identify to some extent with the desire to live outside the law and lets face it-  mobsters are cool.<br/><br/>This movie could've shown the other side, that hey, these are bad people who deserve to be put away, and the cops who risk their lives to do it are heroic. But who knows why Depp's character is going after them? They could've at least given him a stock ""mobsters killed his dad"" motivation or something!<br/><br/>And then there's his wife- Ann Heche- she married an FBI agent not expecting he might be away from home or work odd hours? By the time he finally punches her in the face near the end you almost feel she deserves it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a confused mess of a movie and just plain boring. There is a lot of Pacino mumbling incomprehensively interspersed with some standard gory violence.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie never really resolves itself at all. There is $300,000 in stolen money in his house- so where did it go? Who knows? He could've given it to pacino so he could buy his boat and disspear but for some reason he just forgets and lets mumbly Al get killed instead (we assume)And apparently his wife loves him again at the end, since she wanted a divorce and then he punched her, everything seems to be fine b/c he got a plaque from the FBI?<br/><br/>

"Raskolnikov","10","0","1","17 January 1999"," Humanising the Mafia.
","After the hip, razzle dazzle glamorising of the Mafia that was 'Goodfellas', Donnie Brasco is a breath of fresh air.  While watching Donnie Brasco I was so appreciative of the realism that the characters have to them, this is what stood out to me most in comparison with other mob films.<br/><br/>This feeling is summed up beautifully early on in the film when we see Lefty (Pacino) sitting in front of the TV, watching a nature program, in an ill-fitting red tracksuit, in a 'lived in' looking chair.  This simple and brief moment has the effect of humanising Lefty.  He isn't the larger than life figure that 'wiseguys' are usually depicted as in film, but a real person, who does the normal banal things that all people do in their lives.<br/><br/>The believable characters are not the only fine thing about this film however.  Donnie Brasco is as close to perfectly executed as any film you will see from 1997.  Not a minute is wasted in the slowly unraveling story. Every scene is worthy and important.  The performances are rock solid. With this Depp has graduated to the top grade of leading men, which is quite an achievement for one still so young. Pacino too is superb, offering his best performance in years as the tragic Lefty.  The overlooked Anne Heche and Michael Madsen are both fine in support.<br/><br/>I have little hesitation saying that this is the best mafia film since 'The Godfather Part II'.  Its realism and moving characters place it a notch above the tragically hip 'Goodfellas'.<br/><br/>10/10 - The best film of 1997."

This is the true story of an undercover cop who infiltrates the New York mafia, who get to be good friends with them yet still has to rat them out which leads to their convictions and for some death. Johnny Depp comes up with his best ever acting performance as Donnie Brasco and Al Pacino is out of this world as the wise guy who vouched for him to get him in on the inside. Pacino's performance is as good as any i have ever seen. He comes across as a likable but sad character who ultimately pays for befriending Donnie.

"doodah367","6","0","2","26 November 2001"," Good enough, but let down by length
","I was looking forward to seeing Donnie Brasco as I'm a fan of 'mafia type' films.  This, however, fell short of my expectations for a few reasons, but then again, I did like some themes and ambitious storytelling techniques in the film.<br/><br/>My main faulting with Donnie Brasco is that some parts of it seemed rather rushed to me, which resulted in an element of unintentional confusion. Screenwriter Paul Attansio has ambitiously tried to converge several strands of the story into the film, probably trying to achieve all the elements of the book.  These strands include not only Joseph Pistone/Donnie Brasco's (expertly portrayed by Johnny Depp) undercover work in the Mafia but also the effect his profession has on his home life and the current events in the Mafia.  While this would work well with more explanation, it seems that some parts, especially Pistone's home life, were too rushed and too big jumps were made in the plot.<br/><br/>Some people may be deceived into thinking that Pistone's increasing devotion to the Mafia is because he feels at home or accepted within the organisation but I think that it is much more to do with the theme of friendship, more specifically his friendship with 'Leftie' (Al Pacino on fine form).  The look on Pistone's face when his mafia 'buddies' are beating the hell out of the Japanese waiter is clear evidence to me that he does not want to be a part of it. Friendship is usually a common theme in films of this genre, but it is conveyed in fine detail in the film, showing that despite the obvious, the friendship between the two protagonists is not betrayed.<br/><br/>The character of Pistone/Brasco is developed wonderfully from an FBI agent pretending to be a jewel expert, to actually temporarily becoming part of the Mafia, and back again.  The in depth insight into the character is one of the film's strongest points undoubtedly, almost it's saving grace.<br/><br/>However, the themes and characters do not make up for some of the gaps in the storyline which I observed on a first viewing, and so this film never does excel the tag of just 'good'<br/><br/>6/10"

","We've all seen The Godfather, Scareface and Goodfellas, so who needs Donnie? Johnny Depp headlines as Joe Piscone, an undercover FBI agent, who infiltrates a mob family using the name Brasco. His voucher is Lefty (Al Pacino), a third-rate gangster who has never climbed very far up the corporate ladder. Let's face it--Lefty will never make Senior VP in Bonnano Inc. Pacino plays it conservatively and actually manages to generate some feeling for this hit-man loser who lives vicariously through his protege/surrogate son. We can see the inevitable conflict coming a mile off, as the younger man becomes emotionally involved with his mentor, the revelation of Donnie's true identity growing ever more imminent. Robert Miano is the tough older godfather, Sonny Red, and Michael Madsen is a tough up-and-coming boss, Sonny Black. Black and Red? Those names don't sound Sicilian. Anne Heche has the thankless role of Donnie's ever-complaining wife, and Bruno Kirby is the Joe Pesci wannabe. Betrayal and loyalty are the conflicting themes scrutinized, but Donnie Brasco fails to make a wrenching impression. Mike Newell, a marvelous and intelligent director, goes a little soft here. Still, Donnie Brasco is worth a look for Pacino and Depp in parts they couldn't refuse."

Johnny Depp isn't bad either.  It's based on a true story, but the portrayal of the characters is a bit stereotyped to say the least.  The usually excellent Anne Heche is pretty poor as Depp's wife, and there were a few sloppy parts of the plot.<br/><br/>The FBI had an operation called ""Operation Donnie Brasco"".  Now, I just don't believe that for a second.  That operation name would have got out, with mob connections in the FBI, and he'd have been killed.  They're just not stupid enough to do things like that.<br/><br/>All that aside, it's as good as most other films of this genre since Goodfellas.  Worth a look."

It is just a masterpiece of directing actors and performances and above all, a particular, brilliant performance for Al Pacino.

Al is his usual overacting self, especially in the beginning of the movie, where there's no need for emotions. Johnny Depp is acceptable, even if he's not perfectly cast. But the moustache is ridiculous. In general, there is an obvious effort to give a 70's feel (and I don't mean just the costumes and the premises, but even the way the scenes are shot), maybe trying to capitalize on the success of this genre at the time.
