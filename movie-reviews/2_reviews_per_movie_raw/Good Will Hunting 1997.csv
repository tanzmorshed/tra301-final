"Stephen-12","10","520","570","17 March 1999"," A slow burner, a fine achievement
","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.<br/><br/>Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.<br/><br/>Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.<br/><br/>You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.<br/><br/>The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.<br/><br/>As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement."
"gufando","10","279","322","3 March 2006"," Incredible, moving movie.
","A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.<br/><br/>The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn't even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.<br/><br/>Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.<br/><br/>Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.<br/><br/>The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt's best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet's Society.<br/><br/>If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it's time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>This one is a keeper in my movie library."
"rondine","10","243","289","21 January 2001"," This movie has a brilliant script...
","It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER."
"Eight Two","Null","143","178","18 June 2000"," The Real Best Picture of 1997
","While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was:  a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.<br/><br/>Because before they were anybody, they were just the writers of this tale of a reluctant human being named Will Hunting, a mathematical genius who wore the guise of a hoodlum, and all of the sudden obstacles he had to take on to truly step in to manhood.  Among these obstacles were a straight-forward shrink who outright dared Will to bulls*** him (played by Robin Williams, who got his overdue Oscar for it), a brilliant M.I.T. professor who felt it his own personal redemption to put Will's mind to great use somehow (Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who never fails to steal nearly every scene he's in), and a girl who doesn't understand why the boy she loves so much cannot love her.<br/><br/>It was these obstacles that made Will Hunting such a complex character: while he was a genius at the definite (math), he was a bit of a moron at the indefinite (human relationships).  His rough-edged exterior was simply a cry for help, and the process of which the obstacles in his life realized that and attempted *to* help him was nothing short of extraordinarily touching."
"RedRoadster","9","51","62","29 October 2008"," ""I had to go see about a girl""
","This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" is the story of Will Hunting played by Matt Damon. He is a young man who is a mathematical genius but has no formal education and who is so traumatised by his past that he will not allow himself to be the man he could with his talents. Will works as a Janitor, but chose the Massachusetts institute of technology (the finest mathematical institution in America as we are told) as the place to work in order to be close to an outlet for his brilliance. Early on in the story, the resident Maths guru Professor Gerry Lambeau sets a problem for his students to solve which should take the whole semester for the average mind. When this problem is solved and written on the faculty blackboard the very next morning, he sets another that took him personally two years to solve. The following day he is conversing with a colleague when he witnesses Will writing down the perfect solution on the blackboard again. The Professor realises he has a genius hiding in his midst.<br/><br/>When Will is later involved in a fight, he is eventually given the choice between a short prison term or working with the Professor on a daily basis and also attending psychiatric therapy sessions. Will chooses the latter but uses the therapy sessions as a chance to mock the Psychiatrists assigned to him and show off his knowledge. When no one else will work with him, Professor Lambeau turns to his old room mate at college, Sean MacGuire (played by Robin Williams on Oscar winning form.) who manages to reach the boy emotionally and start to repair the damage that has been done to him.<br/><br/>It is widely known that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck co wrote the screen play as a reaction to their slow progress in establishing Hollywood careers. It is a testament to their talent as writers that they came up with so many touching scenes and passages of dialogue. In particular, Williams monologue to Damon when sat on the park bench is sublime. Wills relationship with ""Skylar"" (played by Minnie Driver) is perfectly believable and as the story unfolds the viewer can see the change in Wills character from the cocky kid, pushing everyone away, to the young man who understands who he could be with the right encouragement.<br/><br/>There are very few flaws to be found in this film, largely because the story is so well told and Robin Williams performance is worth the entry price alone. It is a genuinely touching experience which relates to so many people and is easy to empathise with in real life. The characters are richly written and they are all interdependent in the telling of the proceedings. You really care what happens to these people.<br/><br/>I could ""nick pick"" and draw attention to the psychiatrist scenes in Robert Redfords ""Ordinary People"" (1980) which bear close resemblance to the ones in ""Good Will Hunting"" but I think Damon and Affleck just took the bar up another notch with their interpretation of the Doctor / Patient working relationship.<br/><br/>All in all an uplifting and worthwhile movie going experience which will stay with you long after you leave the cinema."
"Alberto-15","Null","114","154","12 April 1999"," Good doesn't describe it!
","I am totally dumbfounded by some of the reactions to this film.  I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket.  Then there are the people calling it unrealistic.  Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently.  Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing!  Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK.  Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel.  The script is one of the best I've ever seen.  The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like ¬ëThe Catcher in the Rye'.  Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, ¬ëget in touch with your inner Robin Williams'.  But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board.  Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells.  Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines `Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?'  `Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it.  Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will!  I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms.  But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast.   It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream.  Let them watch this ¬ëchewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema.  I think a quote is in order here directed to all you viewers who deemed this film boring or unrealistic `If ignorance is bliss, there should be more happy people.'"
"Gath","10","196","276","23 February 1999"," ""Whatever blows your hair back"" - This movie does it for me!
","This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers.  Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would ""lay down in traffic for you"".  Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing.  Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list.  I was captivated from beginning to end.<br/><br/>If you've not seen it, Good Will Hunting is without doubt a ""renter"", and I think after seeing it, it's one you'll want to own to watch again and again."
"bkoganbing","10","64","87","3 September 2008"," The Genius In Our Midst
","So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor. <br/><br/>Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.<br/><br/>When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.<br/><br/>Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.<br/><br/>Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.<br/><br/>Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.<br/><br/>Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.<br/><br/>I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.<br/><br/>He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.<br/><br/>Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. <br/><br/>I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent."
"obrofta","10","63","86","29 January 2007"," Worth Seeing
","This is a screenplay, whose script was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon and sold for $ 600,000. (They split the proceeds)I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and I still want more at the end (Isn't that what good movies do to you?) The subplots make for mini-movies of their own, especially the interplay between Robin Williams' character and Stellan Skarsgard's character.<br/><br/>Damon's real life buddy Affleck plays that same buddy role in GWH, and provides the definition for true friendship.<br/><br/>Minnie Driver is compelling, and I just love a couple of scenes when she and Damon are in a novelty store, and another where she is telling a joke in a bar with Damon, Affleck and friends. The love story which develops with Driver is very convincing, and it's ""under the surface"" portrayal plus input from one of our favorite characters makes for one of the best definitions of intimacy I have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>When I see some of the movies in IDB's top 250, I am sad that this movie isn't in there, but that is my opinion. Torn between GWH and Rounders as Damon's best movie, though I think GWD plays to a wider audience."

","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script.  The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.<br/><br/>What ""Hunting"" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating.  Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck ""paid their dues"" -- and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality. <br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the  creativity of Damon and Affleck."

","I admire films that shoot high and miss. But it really rankles me when a film pretends to shoot high, avoids doing so because of lack of talent, and lies to us in the process.<br/><br/>There's great drama in the mere existence of an idiot savant. These are people who often are intolerable socially, inadequate in common thinking skills, and generally lead a cursed `elephantman' life, except for their celebration as (in this case) mathematicians. Instead, we're given a watered down likeable homeboy who has been abused. Oh and he has a photographic memory which is a separate pathology (the two never coincide). Depth discarded.<br/><br/>There's truly deep drama in the mathematical problems good Will would be dealing with. But this would require a Nabokov, and his mastery of metaphor. Instead we get the koolaid version for dummies in some (as it turns out) meaningless scribbles and a bubble diagram. Depth is twice discarded. Believe me, this could be played up big; the power of a christ in some of the insights that are speculated -- the voice and eye of God.<br/><br/>There's also common, but good drama in the dedicating of one's life to their gift at great personal sacrifice. We actually have some good films in this regard concerning musicians. Math is better since you don't even get the applause. Here the guy with the insights but lack of language would be codependent martyr with the expert in the formalisms but no vision. But too hard, so pass.<br/><br/>I can attest that there are cinematic depths to be mined at NSA, MIT, even Southie in terms of the absolutely unique and strange feel of the places. How could this film have missed those dark assets and end up so totally without atmosphere?<br/><br/>This movie got made for one reason only: Robin Williams saw a part for himself. Therefore, the previously described  ignorances are filled by an amplified  backstory so Williams can find himself after losing his wife. Pretty damned offensive given the possibilities. I predict that someone will do this story (or something like it) well sometime before I die. It's just too rich, and we do have some bright minds available. Its just not these two kids."

","Good Will Hunting is a story about a 20 year old MIT janitor named Will Hunting (played by Matt Damon). The not-so-flashy hobbies of Mr. Hunting include hanging out with his friends, telling jokes, drinking beer and starting fist fights. But you know what? He's also stupefyingly gifted at mathematics. Will seems to know math better than anyone else in the world, including a Field-medal awarded professor with whom he talks in the movie, just because he has heard some MIT lectures and read a couple of books.<br/><br/>Sounds realistic? No it doesn't. What the movie loses in it's realism, it aims to gain in it's emotional power. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story of the hardships of a mathematical genius the way they did to make a typical moviegoer identify him/herself with the main character. At it's core, Good Will Hunting is a collection of very finely executed drama: romance, violence, fight against authorities. You name it, GWH has it. The level of acting offered by Damon, Affleck, Skarsg√•rd and Driver is good. Robin Williams is excellent.<br/><br/>The movie contains a reference to Srinivasa Ramanujan, a mathematical prodigy from a poor Indian background, who astonished the world with his unconventional theories in the early 20th century. This real life genius received a big book about advanced trigonometry from his teacher at age 10, came to understand it fully by the age of 13 and dedicated the rest of his life to mathematical research.<br/><br/>If Hunting was portrayed as an eccentric like Ramanujan and if his mathematical abilities were an integral part of the character's way of seeing the world, this movie wouldn't probably have had as much viewers as it ended up having, but it could have had some depth and believability.<br/><br/>Sadly Hunting's mathematical/logical abilities are only portrayed in scenes in which he draws some diagrams on paper or chalkboard. It's understandable that creating a superbly talented mind entirely from scratch is hard for writers who are not mathematical geniuses. You might ask then, why did Damon & Affleck choose to write a story about a mathematical genius in the first place? Had they chosen any other type of talent, they would very probably have been able to create a more convincing character. My guess is that they did that simply because mathematical abilities are often seen as something mystical and mystical abilities draw in crowd to theaters.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Good Will Hunting.

But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.<br/><br/>What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons.  And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.<br/><br/>Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while.

When I attended film school I was told GOOD WILL HUNTING is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . This movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15<br/><br/>Structure aside the idea of a member of the American underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . Ask yourself this : If he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? Not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? Highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . And if Will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in American prisons ?<br/><br/>But it`s the casting that let much of the film down . You want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough Irish gang members ? Let`s get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do gooder . I failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed Damon and Affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all Billy Bob Thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here<br/><br/>There are some good points to the movie . Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of Europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as Williams character explains to Will what he has seen in life<br/><br/>But I`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and I`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said GOOD WILL HUNTING is boring and unconvincing"

The chemistry between Damon and Minnie Driver was non-existent.

"Carlton","3","21","41","7 January 1999"," An over-rated drama for popular culture
","It's very predictable that a movie like this would soon be placed into that undefined category of ""good"" recent movies, which includes any film having the smallest bit of sincerity and meaning. The fact that the popular trend is toward the visual and that special effects are replacing plots and subtle nuances tends to lead the average viewer to the opinion that any film that attempts these is a grand effort. This is not true. ""Good Will Hunting"" does not even have a well-defined plot, but that fits into the movie acceptably: it's an extraordinary man's search for himself through love, psychoanalysis, and philosophy. The premier problem is that the movie overplays it's best card: Matt Damon's(character's) incredible brain. There is a certain point at which the audience should halt its fascination at his mental profencies and sigh in boredom. It's unfortunate that this was not the case for most theaters. Though the meaning of life and gifted individuals are good themes for movies, they are not original, and this ""tear-jerker"" makes no unique contributions to either idea. In fact, if you want to see real meaning in a popular movie, rent ""Rocky"", a title which many supposed ""film experts"" would probably not want to admit conveys deeper human meaning than most ""good"" movies, like (appropriately) Good Will Hunting. Shame on you,  movie fans, for falling in love with such a butchered attempt at profundity."

"Serva","1","33","69","7 February 2009"," Not So Good Will Hunting
","Good Will Hunting is a story about a genius who for various reasons has not been able to take advantage of this and, when we are introduced to him in the film, is working as a cleaner at a university. This guy's name is Will Hunting and he is played by Matt Damon. He solves a ridiculously difficult maths problem and is found by a maths teacher at the school played by Stellan Skarsg√•rd. And it goes from there.<br/><br/>I think that if I had watched this movie when it was released, prior to Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's careers, I would've been able to enjoy it much more. Since they have both written the script and play leading roles in the film it's hard not to judge it with this in mind. Neither Damon nor Affleck appear to be people who would pick fights, rather they appear to be people who would avoid something like that to a large extent in order to not danger their good looks. They are very much cast against type, but that ties in with the fact that most likely one of the main reasons they wrote this script was to shape roles for themselves to launch their respective careers. I would have no problem with this, if this was a good movie, which unfortunately, it is not. Minnie Driver also is not good looking enough for her part to be believable.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant is one of my favorite directors, although I find his later more ""experimental"" movies - like Elephant, Paranoid Park and Psycho - much more rewarding as opposed to his earlier work which is more conventional and main stream. The main problem with this film though lies within the script, so I suppose he did what he could with what he was given in this case. For a movie to be entertaining, gripping and interesting, you need a conflict. I fail to find such a thing in this motion picture, and I did look for it the entire running time.<br/><br/>It is a mystery as to what you are supposed to feel for the main character in this film. It is hard to feel pity for him since he himself is the main obstacle to getting what he wants, success, money, respect and so on. Many people try to help him but he fights them with all he has got. He has the personality of a spoiled brat (funny enough that in the picture this is the very opposite of what he is supposed to be: A poor bastard who has had to fight his way to survive). It is also hard to identify with him since a very small percentage of the viewers of this film are geniuses who has not had to lift a finger to get where they are.<br/><br/>It's easier to understand the problems of this movie if you compare it to a film about a similar subject which actually works. In Rain Man the main character truly is pitiful. His fate is a sad one since he is gifted but his disability has rendered him unable to interact normally with other people. The film is gripping since the viewer feels for the main character and his brother trying so desperately to reach him and find a place for him in this world.<br/><br/>In a word you can sum up this film as plastic or fake: It's a pseudo-intellectual movie of the worst sort, it tries to go deep but only scratches the surface. A positive: Robin Williams does a great job with his role, he always seems to do better when he is given a serious part to play. When I saw Matt Damon in this film all I could think of was his involuntary part in Team America: World Police. ""MATT DAMON!"". Even though he was played by a doll in that film, his part seemed more real than in Good Will Hunting."

So, when some dumb kid sees this movie, he's suppost to say to himself, ""You know, I'm not as smart as Will. I'm more like his friend. So, I really shouldn't worry about succeeding in life. Like Ben Affleck's character, I should be happy working construction while my smart friend needs to get motivated and succeed.""

Here's a news flash:  this kind of knowledge doesn't come from innate intelligence, it also requires incredible amounts of reading. So when did Will supposedly do all this reading?  we see him depicted as a working-class goof-off who spends his time carousing with his friends and getting into fights.  Sorry, but that doesn't compute.  At all.<br/><br/>2: The direction and editing is terrible.  All of the key moments go by as if they weren't even important.

For me that says it all. Little imagination, laughably hackneyed worn out characters and a plot with more holes in it than a sieve.<br/><br/>We are expected to swallow the fact that he knows more about law, history, mathematics and English literature than the 'experts' we are haplessly presented with in these various fields. OK but how on earth does he achieve this from the public library while holding down a full time job and apparently cultivating lasting friendships with the ne'erdowells with whom he associates, relationships, we are also expected to believe led him regularly into trouble with the authorities?<br/><br/>Anyone who knows the 'genius fallen by the wayside' scenario in real life knows only too well that there is never a happy ending.

Impossible also that he had read so many books and acquired so much knowledge and in addition still have understood and memorized everything with only 20 years. And no one in his right mind, with such a gift, would prefer to lay bricks for the rest of his life and be a criminal with an enviable record at the age of 20 - as Will Hunting himself says in the film, putting down bricks is also a very dignified and noble profession, but the entire plot of the film becomes unrealistic with his insistence on living in rejection of his potential.<br/><br/>The direction of Gus Van Sant is insipid and does not help to improve the movie.

In one scene at the beginning of the movie he almost beats a former high school student colleague to death.  At this point I wanted to stop watching the movie. The beating was disgusting.<br/><br/>Will solves mathematical problems with the same ease that the average guy solves crossword puzzles but his psychological problems are an obstacle to utilizing his genius. I shall say no more about the plot except that, as expected from a sophomoric project, the ending is predictable and even banal.<br/><br/>The movie won a number of awards including the Oscar for Best Screenplay (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) and the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams). In my humble opinion, the awards were a reflection of the appreciation by the movie industry that two inexperienced guys, Damon and Affleck, could pull off a full-length feature film and were not a reflection of any inherent quality in the movie.  Robin Williams was much better in ""Dead Poets Society"" and in ""Fischer King"" but didn't win any oscar for these performances.<br/><br/>Further evidence of the immaturity that so typifies this movie is the fact that the supporting cast were all chosen from family and friends:  Skylar, Will Hunting's girl friend, is played by Minnie Driver who he was dating at the time.  Furthermore, Hunting's screen-friends are played by Casey Affleck, Ben Affleck's brother, and by a personal friend, Cole Hauser.

Furthermore, the ""psychological"" side of the story is simple and really contains nothing new or interesting (basically, it's the story of a normal guy who's had some issues in his life, who reads avidly and has a great interest in math, yet somehow does not even know the names of the theorems he makes use of in his ""proofs"").

The point of the entire frame was to get Matt Damon and Robin Williams in the same room. They could've saved so much time shortening it. The rest was just transport. Everything about the kids life was uninteresting. The silliest sob story. His relationship with the Harvard girl was a yawn-fest. Bad acting. <br/><br/>I'm a liberal, so they were preaching to the choir, but even I found the long liberal speeches a bore. People don't talk like that. There's a rule in fiction... show don't tell. They forgot that rule. How did this film get nominated for nine Oscars, including best picture?!? This is first year English major level of writing. So bad dialogue. Such a weak contrived script. It tries to make some blindingly obvious points about it sucking to be poor. This is not news. Also... everybody was hot and sexy with a smoking hot body. Not believable at all. Just took me right out of it. <br/><br/>Both me and my girlfriend sat with dropped jaws wondering how this got so high ratings. The good acting does not save this film. Yes, there's some top notch fine acting here. Both Matt Damon and Robin Williams to stellar performances. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, who I know is a good actor, couldn't save his silly role. Such a stupid idea for a film. <br/><br/>I do not understand this films greatness"

","I wanted to like this movie-- and did like a few minor elements of it-- but my enjoyment was greatly overshadowed by my overwhelming distaste with Damon's insanely unbelievable self-aggrandizement.<br/><br/>Sorry, no one is a 'genius' in all fields, including the fields that he hasn't even studied! What, he got the info by osmosis? Telepathy? When did he find the time to read up on every subject in existence?<br/><br/>The film did have a few things I liked-- I liked Robin Williams' character; and I liked the academic environment. This movie might possibly have worked if they didn't go so ridiculously, ludicrously overboard. If they had made Damon's character even a halfway believable ""genius"", this might have possibly worked. But gee, one of the writers just happens to make his character into the greatest genius in Earth's history. How self-indulgent is that?"

","What is so good about this film? I hated this film with so many reasons. The hero,Matt Damon is a handsome genius with early life trauma,so he is allowed to do anything and using foul language and fist fighting and all that gives him extra charm. But he seemed like either a complete hypocrite or a artifice-made-to-plot to me.  If all he wanted in life was getting drunk and fight why did he choose to work in the university(what a convenient place to be noticed for the sake of story) as a janitor in the first place? Why not burger king? With the vast knowledge and deep insight in politics, economics and psycho-analysis, why wasn't he able to get over with his own problem?<br/><br/>And that counselling session, learn-from-each other and klick!problem solved!!! No, it's so schematic and unconvincing as the whole film. I totally agree on the user comment(what an arrogant...) During the film, listening to their ping-pong talk, I thought of Forrest Gump. Despite all the flaws and non-sensical coincidences, I think Forrest Gump is a very moving film. If you ask the differences of the two films, I would say:<br/><br/>surrealism vs pseudo-realism<br/><br/>running(release of freedom,metaphor of advance, hope)vs talking(do you know what you are talking about?)<br/><br/>Ideal simpleton and whiny, pretentious genius.<br/><br/>Should've watched on big screen, wouldn't have watched on video."

Am I supposed to relate to the poor misunderstood prodigy with the humble, blue collar heritage? This is just a typical Hollywood Cinderella fantasy relocated to Academia with some heartrending pablum tossed in for the ladies.

","I'm aware of the significance of this movie in bringing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to prominence not only as actors but as screenwriters and watched it with a degree of expectation. However the story of Damon's rebellious, tortured working-class genius flowering in the rarefied hot-house atmosphere of Boston's Harvard University didn't quite engage me, despite some good acting.<br/><br/>The story is implausible in the extreme, as Damon's gifted character shyly but deliberately puts himself forward to get noticed by answering a difficult mathematical problem on display in the halls of the university and then follows his difficult progress to self- awareness which he ultimately achieves through encountering burn-out been there-done that psychologist Robin Williams and a pretty but feisty Anglophile student, played by Minnie Driver.<br/><br/>I was entertained by the movie but felt its mix of low comedy (profanity is frequent, especially when Damon gets down with his gang of fellow low-lifes which includes best mate Chuckie, played by Affleck) with heightened psychological drama didn't always convince. Naturally, Damon gets off to a frosty start with last-resort Willams and even more naturally they open up to each other before the tears really flow in one of the movie's well signposted climaxes further down the line. Ditto the obvious conclusion too when Damon finally lets his heart rule his head.<br/><br/>It's well acted although at times it seems pretty stagy, with lots of male-bonding and man- hugs on board. Damon is believable as the gifted misfit but overdoes the angst at times. I didn't quite get Affleck as the goofy sidekick and got the impression he was cast for the part because he wrote it. Williams is good as the broken-down professor but his winsomeness and adoration of his deceased wife grate a bit by the end, Spencer Tracy he's not and while Driver is okay in her part, I didn't really feel the attraction between her and Damon..<br/><br/>In the end, while the film engaged me enough, it did seem to me somewhat overrated and didn't quite take me fully on Will's journey to rehabilitation and spiritual redemption."

It only goes to show that no matter how great the accolades or how high the rating you can still end up watching the most appalling drivel, dressed up as some kind of worthwhile exercise in entertainment. Bulls balls, last night I watched ""in Bruges"" and it was very good, a million miles away from this Oscar winning (substitute prohibited word).<br/><br/>OK so now I must get down to a serious criticism of the movie, based on twenty five minutes and twenty seven seconds, after which I couldn't stomach it any more. Where do I start? Hollywood in its purest form is a place (a fantasy) where we are taken and everything is wonderful. But this kind of Hollywood is just a pretend world which is not real and not uplifting either, it neither corresponds to an ideal or a real, it is just pap. It is a depressed fantasy of a reality that never existed. The idea that you have a genius cleaning a college corridor and filling out maths equations on a blackboard, and then having a verbal fist fight with a student at a bar by quoting lots of long words and phrases at him, which will really impress the girl at the bar with the English accent is just so lame, why would anybody think that that was cleaver. Is this film just patronising uneducated but intelligent people or what, I don't know. I give up."

How can a street kid without any education solve mathematical puzzles that even professors at Harvard University can't work out ??? Albert Einstein is mentioned several times in the movie as a parallel to Will Hunting, but don't forget that Eintein said, that to become a genius, you need 2% inspiration and 98% transpiration. What makes it even worse is that Will not only masters mathematics but history, literature, chemistry etc. as well. To me, Will is much too much of a Superman, and I couldn't identify with him in ny way.

Not only were Will and Chuckie endearing characters, every one else in the film conveyed a smooth and natural performance. Even Minnie Driver proved she could fit in her role as Skylar.

"jonsefcik","6","8","14","25 April 2017"," Easy Math
","Overall, I think this movie is good but perhaps a little overrated. I'll talk about everything else later but the biggest issue everyone overlooks is the supposedly ""difficult"" math problems Professor Lambeau assigns at the beginning of the movie. The first problem has four parts which involve finding an adjacency matrix, a new matrix after 3 walks in G, and generating two functions for walks. To be fair, the average moviegoer wouldn't know what the problem is about, but it would be no problem for a graduate-level math student. The second problem asks for the number of trees with n labeled vertices and to draw all homeomorphically irreducible trees with n = 10. An undergraduate student who has taken discrete math and/or graph theory would be able to solve this problem as well. The extra attention to detail of assigning the class a genuinely difficult problem for a graduate- level mathematics course would've given the film more credibility, without feeling like it was ""dumbed down"" for the general movie-going audience.<br/><br/>I'll briefly mention everything else: Robin Williams is the best part of the movie; he turns in a strong, versatile performance and is the only likable character. Matt Damon's acting is also great but his character is (for me personally) so abrasive and hard to sympathize with, despite his tragic past. The first 30-40 minutes dragged for me and I felt almost half of that section could have been cut. Once the movie gets going, its pretty engaging and there are a couple genuinely emotional scenes. If you're curious about checking it out, don't be discouraged. It might sound like I'm saying a lot of bad things about it, and even though its not perfect, its worth seeing at least once."

","This is undeniably a character-driven film, and I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more if the eponymous character was a little more realistic. Matt Damon clearly knew he would be playing Will Hunting- he and co-writer Ben Affleck crafted a self-indulgent character that actors dream about. First of all, he's great looking.  Secondly, he's wild and rebellious. Thirdly- and best of all- he's a genius!  Any flaws in the character are created only to give Damon opportunity to display himself as an actor. Robin Williams is totally uninteresting- how'd he get an Oscar?  And Minnie Driver- why is this woman an actress?  Had this movie been written by someone with any sense of character, it could have been great; as it stands, it's barely good. (Gee- a closing line almost as cute as the movie's title!)"

","From reading reviews of this film I could not figure out why anyone would want to see it, so I didn't bother. As fate would have it though I happened to be on a plane when it was shown as the in-flight movie and so I got to check it out.<br/><br/>I have to say that my view might be influenced by the awful mangling that films get before being unleashed on the flying public. Firstly, all swearwords are either removed or changed to something different, often with hilarious results. (When I saw Money Train ""mother-f*!@er"" had been changed to ""mother-fouler"". I think the original was preferable, don't you?) Secondly, anything that resembles a swearword, such as ""oh dear"" and ""my, my, how distressing"", is removed. Thirdly, anything of a sexual nature is removed. Ultra-violence is left in and I believe the airlines have a special arrangement whereby extra scenes of violence can be inserted. Finally the colour is distorted, the sound passed fifteen times through a bucket of slime using 1920's technology and the whole thing is projected onto a screen the size of a postage stamp which is half obscured by a person in a big hat. So you have to bear in mind that these things could jaundice my views.<br/><br/>The film, as everyone in the world knows, revolves around a young mathematical genius who works as a janitor until he is discovered by a professor and sent to a shrink. Will Hunting is played by an attractive young man who everyone raves about but whose name escapes me. Robin Williams, almost acting for the first time in his life, is the shrink who shows him tough love. An attractive young woman with an English accent whose name escapes me plays Will's girlfriend. Other characters drift in and out of the film.<br/><br/>So this young genius gets discovered, has a few traumas along the way, teaches his prof and his shrink things they had not realised themselves and they all live happily ever after. End of film.<br/><br/>About half way through the film I began to get interested when Will Hunting actually started to show some anger and treated his girlfriend with casual cruelty. Unfortunately this only lasted about ten seconds before we went back to everyone being nice and speaking in clich√©s. If only they'd let rip at this point, what a film it could have been. It could be that the airline cut out thirty minutes of dark and dangerous stuff but I don't think so somehow.<br/><br/>Let's have a reality check here shall we? A young man grows up in poverty and is abused by his parents whilst secretly being not only a mathematical genius but also an expert on diverse other academic fields and able to wipe the floor with all comers. His other poor friends all have hearts of gold, club together to buy him a car and feel not the slightest resentment towards him. In a matter of weeks he seduces a conveniently rich young woman, solves the secrets of the universe, gets offered jobs worth zillions of dollars despite lacking formal qualifications and being fashionably anti-establishment, finds a therapist who is not him/herself dysfunctional, heals his inner child and rides off into the sunset in a glow of sickly-sweet ickyness. I don't think so.<br/><br/>I didn't like the in-your-face manipulation of this film, directed by a dazzling young person whose name escapes me. I didn't like the clich√©d and hackneyed script. I didn't like the glib solutions to really tough personal problems. This was just the American Dream in another version. We all have some hidden talent and when we decide to follow our dream we will be rich and happy beyond our wildest imaginings. The fact that we received emotional and physical traumas that would cripple the average person for this lifetime and their next fourteen reincarnations can be overcome. We can heal our lives. Hallelujah! <br/><br/>Actually, if I saw this on late night television and I'd had a few beers I'd probably quite enjoy it. But it does not deserve the massive hype and Oscar wins that it has received. No way"

However it owes more to Ordinary People (the film best remembered - or is it forgotten!? -  for  robbing Raging Bull of the Best Picture Oscar!) than any other.<br/><br/>Hard to really believe the central character who seems to have read lots of books and done a lot of studying off-screen (how, why and when are not fully explained). On-screen he seems much more interested in fighting on street corners, shouting at his working class friends (even when they are sat next to him), and getting clever-clever with authority.<br/><br/>Good performance from Matt Damon in the central role, but Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who helps him (and who himself ends up helped), is the standout. Here is guy who can say more with a look than most actors can do with a hundreds lines of dialogue. Shame that even the academics seem  to swear just as readily and just as often as those lower down the food chain.<br/><br/>Mini Driver is quite touching as an English student (rich - but not a bitch!) who catches our hero's eye. While bringing dimension to the movie, you get the feeling that this was included in case the rest of the plot flopped. It wouldn't take too much editing to make this the central theme with the rest being the background. However this was not needed.<br/><br/>Too many good moments and too much of an engaging plot for us not be lightly charmed - but I wasn't moved by this movie. Our hero's working class friends are loyal - but that is about all you can say for them. Ben Affleck (in the ""best friend"" role) shows that haircuts, cheekbones and teeth are still what really counts in tinsel town. <br/><br/>The sterile world of (Boston) academia and the juvenile world of the street (as portrayed here) both alienated me.

","The only reason this movie got made, I suppose, is that Robin Williams found a role he liked and wanted to do. A few notes : (1). The type of ""genius"" that is portrayed here does not, to my knowledge, exist. Mathematics and the humanities emanate from two different areas in the brain, both of which are NEVER simultaneously developed to the extent indicated here. On top of that Will Hunting has what is apparently a photographic memory. AND he's very good-looking, *AND* he's a tough. Wow. This is really yet another dumbed-down Superhero movie in disguise.<br/><br/>(2). Psychiatry is a highly complex and arcane field, as intellectually formidable as anyone could want. You can neither embrace it nor reject it wholesale. The pompous, self-deluded disdain shown by uneducated people for ""shrinks"" is here also shown by Will, thereby negating his supposed intellectual worthiness. Also, psychoanalytic theory ceased being at the forefront of psychotherapy decades ago. People who are still bashing Freud should really do a bit of reading.<br/><br/>This falls into the category of 99% of films that are designed for passive viewing, and not to challenge or stimulate the viewer in any real sense. It all adds up to a big nothing ; just a bunch of oversweetened moments that will work for people who have no real mental life. The ""math"" here is little more than a set-prop with no real depth or detail (Disclaimer : I am an engineer). Will Hunting and his coterie of ""friends"" are really total dumbasses. The ""girlfriend"" is skin-crawlingly obnoxious, but then again men are desperate fools, so I guess he COULD endure her.<br/><br/>The two kids who wrote this movie have never actually read a difficult book.

","Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.<br/><br/>It is very hard to believe two 25yos wrote this script with such realistic relational depth. There are some very powerful emotional dynamics in this movie--the scene with Will & Skyler in her apartment when Will unpacks. The monumental scene with Will and Sean ""It's not your fault""--when a movie is a template for real life, this is an epic work of art! This movie allowed people to talk and relate when emotions were road blocks, to point to a scene in Good Will Hunting to establish a base for communication.<br/><br/>Here's a point in real time. I was writing this review and a friend called. He ended up hanging up the phone on me because I questioned him about a project. He did a ""Will"" in Skyler's room on me because I tapped a dark shadow in his life. His sensitivity to being questioned is such a part of his identity he is unconscious about, but something that causes him great conflict in his marriage which is now a divorce, his inability to stay employed, and history with addiction.<br/><br/>This movie lays a template for men's issues!"

Then I saw it again today on TV and was dismayed at much I had apparently been sucked in by the Hollywood hype:  two kids write the screenplay, star in it as well, it's an utterly brilliant film and gets an Oscar -- and I fell for it hook, line and sinker.  OK, I will let this be a lesson to myself.  The way I see it today is that it is a well - executed film, but the story is pure drizzle.  Not just non - academic yob turns out to be talented, that would have been a realistic premise and could have made for a likeable movie.  But not good enough for Hollywood -- instead it has to be a janitor at the MIT, and of course he is a gazillion times more brilliant than the professor (who is of course a field - medal - aspiring genius in his own right) of the very building he is working in.  Hold on, I'm not finished. And this dude is also a genius in other areas, at least enough so to impress the judge with his legal cognizance, and he can quote lengthy passages out of philosophy books and he's into organic chemistry just for kicks, and he is a total fire - fighter - cute hunk as well, and he's good at fisticuffs too, and he wins the heart and hand of this super - intelligent, cute and rich chick who turns out to have a heart of gold and is the only one to accept him for what he really is, but he has got this problem facing his own genius because he would rather continue his squalid life of petty crime and dead - end jobs (hey, don't we all?), but then this brilliant psychiatrist who looks ten times more like Sigmund Freud than the man himself comes to the rescue, and -- totally unexpected -- things tie up to a happy end.

Did it just appeal to people because they think they are really smart and have never expressed themselves, so they identify with some character who has an inherent knowledge of differential equations and sociology.  Nothing was believable in this movie: the love, the pain, the character, or the premise.  Ben Affleck's character was the only redeeming quality in the movie.

Other dialogues are so over the top, so vehemently direct and so unaware of the circumstances that one has to cringe or laugh in reaction. At one point in the story the movie seems to forget the concept of narrative progression. And oh boy, don't let me start about the ridiculous and self-indulgent plot. Do I have to mention how inconsistent it is? Or how stupid? Just from the get go. Anyway, is not that awful and there's a couple of thought provoking lines here and there, and Robin Williams is good, so all hope is not lost.

Good Will Hunting was a simple film that offered a lot. It had a bit of everything, some very nice relationships amongst characters which was great drama and at times extremely funny. The film flows at a good pace which kept me interested all the way through, the story was intriguing as I really related to the characters well.<br/><br/>There were plenty of good laughs throughout the film as well as some truly memorable scenes packed with emotional punch, mostly from the meetings between Sean & Will, the way their relationship developed was full of heart. My favourite scene has to be the ""farting wife"" scene, absolutely hilarious and made even better when I found out after that it was improvised, Robin was so funny that even the director was laughing, making the camera shake during that particular scene.<br/><br/>Overall a truly memorable film that I certainly hope to watch again & again.

"ES-III","Null","7","14","8 November 2002"," Essential Resolution?
","Twenty-year old Boston `southie' Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is madly charismatic and absolutely intelligent and understanding, but is, at the same time, a loose cannon; a roughneck-psychopath who lashes out at the nearest target.  And while that may be the stark, conflicting, didactic point the film is making, it also serves as its weakest element.  So what if he `finds himself' at the end by hugging Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) ¬ñ he's still a presumptuous and brazen maniac with severe psychological problems (and a societal mutineer that's half humanitarian, half dipsomaniac).  I don't think he especially meets his match in McGuire ¬ñ he just gains a friend with a solid foundation that only points part of Will in the right direction. Hunting has a photographic memory (he's like Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character without the autistic disorder, or Little Man Tate), and can solve problems that only frustrate Nobel Prize winning mathmaticians.  Eventually, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau (Breaking the Waves' Stellan Skarsgard), who saves him from a jail sentence, and he is introduced to McGuire.  Now, Robin Williams is one of my all-time favorites, but I didn't like him at all in this film ¬ñ he plays the role far too cutesy.  I didn't particularly believe his struggle, his stories or his fleeting tough-guy flash.  He just seemed over-emotional and gooey, downplaying his high-strung energy.  Likewise, he could've been brainier and more quick-witted; more of a match for Hunting (their silent chess-game should have been replaced with a shouting match of facts and figures).  On the other hand, Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British student at Harvard, who falls in love with Will and tries to help him, is both absorbing and playful (just as she was in Grosse Point Blank).<br/><br/>So I have some objections with the film, but it's still, for the most part, a smart, involving story with good characterization. It's got individual flashes of brilliance within an otherwise predictable story.  Apparently, Damon and Affleck wrote the movie years ago, and finally got to see the project made ¬ñ good for them!  In their defense, the two spin a great underlying theme about the working class, and how straightforward (and thus, romantic) it is to be an unassuming bricklayer.  Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck) says it best when he tells Hunting, `You're sitting on a winning lottery ticket -- it would be an insult to us if you're still around here in 20 years.'  I just didn't experience the essential resolution I was, perhaps, supposed to feel by the final frame."
"buzznzipp1995","10","5","9","13 September 2006"," First Script, Brilliant, the wonder-boys, Ben and Matt.
","I was just starting to write stories, scripts, in my spare time. I wanted to get the form down, so for me, just writing was an exercise in itself. I was putting together a rather simple, down and out story nothing special. Writing in early 97'. <br/><br/>I had heard a story on how Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had put this script together and had 'shopped' it all over Hollywood and were both kind of ready to sell it, even for a 'piece of chicken' (Jokingly they said in an interview) but they were sort of at their wits'-end when....- it finally happened.<br/><br/>Then, look what happened...2 Oscars, 16 other awards and 34 nominations on top of that! Why? Two reasons I can find. First off, they did not give up, or give in to the temptation to finally quit. The other, and this is just a 'shot in the dark' but, the movie was victorious. No, arguments can truly take solid ground against the film, other than yes, they had an affinity for the 'F'-word. <br/><br/>These 'Southies' were really playing the 'streeters' of Boston to steely perfection. They were who they set out to be in their writing. I was amazed, this story touched deeply. they showed the struggle and the belief in and they all sort of had a love for their 'Brilliant' janitor friend, knowing that he is destined for more than they were going to encounter in life. And they still stood up for him and with him on everything from street fights to getting him in the end to embrace what he needed to do and follow and not fear the great task ahead of him. The biggest thing for me in this story is the element of distrust, that came from Matt's Character. He was abused by his dad and through that impact that started the massive down-slide (avalanche) of destructive behavior and thoughts of uselessness in himself. He was almost brought to a place that he might not return, as he didn't feel that he could love or give anything to Skyler, because he was scared of love itself. What should have been there at his childhood home (love) was abandoned to an evil overlord that was nothing more than a 'liability' to his life and personal growth. His biological father became a 'bully' worse than any kid at school on the playground. <br/><br/>They even brought back some classic seventies tunes that I had forgotten for years, I enjoyed the way that they, placed the music in the different sequences, it was just right. To boot, Matt's character needs to keep the !! Skylar loved him, and he would eventually learn to love other than what he had known before, new and more openly. <br/><br/>When the movie ended I was no less than blown away. As a matter of fact I got scared. I was so intimidated, that I stopped writing. Than I heard about the Oscar wins. Robin's first I think it was. And the other wins and nominations and I thought, after a while later, if I quit, I may miss having something to offer to my friends and family, maybe even this country. So I looked at their example and remembered what I took away from the movie and put it back together again for myself. <br/><br/>This one is an inspiration all around. This was a winner through and through! It may have been crass and vulgar and just slightly violent, but that just identified the plot of the story as it got going.<br/><br/>They deserved every award that they received. <br/><br/>This goes beyond just movie for me, it's not as some have been merely entertainment, but it strikes me like life does sometimes, even when God wants to get through to us. We just need to listen and then do the 'right' thing. But we have to follow through for anything good to happened. <br/><br/>I recommend this Gus Van Sant, directed and gifted film highly. <br/><br/>If you can't get passed the expletives.... check out Cleanfilms.com on the web."

This is how intelligent people are represented in our society. Every film one sees about this subject touts the virtues of the retard, and deprecates and misrepresents the smart. The ultimate example of this stuff, The Mighty, last year's film starring Sharon Stone tells the story of her son (in the movie), who is a sickly boy who will soon outgrow his bones. His organ will be too large for the space between the bones and he'll die. And he does. The only mitigating factor is that he meets a boy his age who is all muscle and no brains. Together with this boy Stone's son can get about. It's like the old joke ""Well, I'm the bum whole and if I shut down operations, you'll all be in torture, including you stupid brain! This movie Good Will Hunting is like so many movies from the kind of people who have given us things like child protection services, repressed memories suits, the abuse excuse in court, etc. America lives in an orgy of equalization, destroying everything and anything that looks better, let along outstanding.

Sean Maguire is brought in for the therapy while Will and his friend Chuckie go on with their normal lives.<br/><br/>This is a quite hyped film (the rise of scriptwriters Damon and Affleck was already along the way before this hit - there's is not quite a rags to riches story for them), however there is much to enjoy here.  The story never fully explains how Will came to develop his talent or even how he came to know about it - was he born knowing everything about maths?  You feel that Will could have been given a little less arrogance - nobody knows everything.  However the story is quite interesting and it's given such a fairytale gloss that details are not important.<br/><br/>The script also gives Williams a chance to do yet another tear-jerker role and get an Oscar for his troubles.  Affleck and Driver are also good in support but Damon is the lead.  His character has layers and he does have plenty of good scenes, but the main problem is that his arrogance is not shown as a negative trait and it tends to make him a little unsympathetic.<br/><br/>Overall a good piece of Hollywood fairy tale gloss that does what it has to do - not a classic but it's a nice bit of sentimental tosh."
"daver-4","4","4","7","2 May 1999"," Ordinary People, anyone?
","This movie is overrated, predictable and manipulative. There is some quirkiness in the dialogue and Matt Damon does a great job (giving credit to where credit is due), but I can't believe how some audiences and critics view this movie as ""revolutionary.""  First off, the relationship between Damon and Robin Williams echoes, right up to the ""it's not your fault"" climax, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People.  The people in Will Hunting's life who attempt to get through to him--Ben Affleck, Williams, Minnie Driver, etc--was also liberally borrowed from Robert Redford's classic.  As for Williams, the fact he won an Oscar for what is basically a replay of his ""Dead Poet's Society"" role is baffling to me.  I'd like to think that Oscar rewarded him for his overlooked dramatic performances in World According to Garp, Moscow on the Hudson, Awakenings and The Fisher King--his performances in all of those films blew his ""GWH"" Oscar-winning performance away. Much of this movie is paint-by-numbers (especially the climax).  There were some deeper aspects to Will's life that Damon conveyed with his fine acting, yet they were never explored.  Bottom line:  If the movie had not been described as being ""brilliant"" and ""groundbreaking,"" my expectations would have been lower.  Put this with ""Rain Man""and ""Terms of Endearment"" as one of the most overrated films of the last 20 years.  Give me overlooked, unpredictable character dramas like ""Dominick and Eugene"" and ""Birdy"" over this one."

","Will Hunting is a young working-class man from South Boston who works as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His favourite pastimes are hanging out with a gang of his friends, getting drunk, getting into fights and breaking the law. He also happens to be a mathematician of genius, whose talents are revealed when he is seen writing out the answer to a problem which has baffled the world's greatest mathematical minds and which Professor Lambeau, a lecturer at the Institute, has written on a blackboard. The Professor becomes Will's mentor, trying to nurture his mathematical talents, and when Will again gets into trouble with the law on assault charges, Lambeau arranges a deal whereby he will qualify for parole provided he agrees to psychiatric treatment. The first two psychiatrists Will is sent to find him too much to handle, but eventually Lambeau refers him to an old friend, Sean Maguire. <br/><br/>Maguire is an unhappy man, grieving over the death of his wife. At first he and Will find it difficult to get on with each other, but later discover a rapport. The rest of the film can be seen as the story of the psychological journeys of Will and Sean. (The film's title is presumably a laboured pun on the main character's name and on the meaning 'hunting for goodwill'). Will must decide whether to develop his talents or to remain with his friends in the blue-collar milieu with which he is most familiar; he also needs to overcome his childish, self-destructive impulses and develop a more mature, responsible attitude towards others, particularly his girlfriend Skylar. Sean needs to come to terms with his devastating loss.<br/><br/>Robin Williams's touching performance as Sean is nonetheless a very good one, and quite the best thing about this film, although I am not sure that it was really deserving of an Oscar (I preferred Anthony Hopkins in 'Amistad'). On the other hand, I thought that Williams deserved Oscars for 'Good Morning Vietnam' and 'Dead Poets Society' and was passed over on each occasion, so justice has finally been done. I was less impressed, however, by the other leading actors. Stellan Skarsgard was not convincing as Lambeau and Minnie Driver as Skylar even less so. <br/><br/>More crucially to the success of the film, Matt Damon never succeeded in bringing Will to life or in bridging the gap between the two sides of his character, brilliant intellectual on the one hand and street thug on the other. To be fair to Damon the actor (as opposed to Damon the scriptwriter), the fault lies less in the way the character is played than in the way the character is written. Will is not just a brilliant mathematician but a brilliant polymath with an encyclopedic knowledge of subjects such as history and law. (He uses the former in a devastating put-down of an arrogant Harvard student in a bar, and the latter in an attempt to defend himself in Court). To judge from his conversations with Sean, he also seems to fancy himself as a psychoanalyst. It is possible that a person with only basic formal education could have acquired such knowledge of diverse subjects, but only through a rigorous programme of study, and Will's life outside of his work seems to revolve around bar-rooms rather than libraries and boozing and brawling rather than auto didactic learning.<br/><br/>Besides the central character's lack of credibility, the film's other main weakness is its funereal pace- too much talk and too little in the way of action. The central message- that man cannot live by the intellect alone, but also needs emotional sustenance and a system of moral values- is a worthy one, but I would have liked to have seen it conveyed in a more believable and less long-winded manner. 5/10 (a mark that would have been lower but for Williams)."

","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve every word of praise they got for this movie, IMO. Instead of complaining that there weren't enough meaty roles around for them they got to work writing their own, and beautifully written it is too. There is some debate about whether veteran screenwriter William Goldman had a hand in the finished product, but nobody slags off Tobe Hooper because Steven Spielberg supposedly directed the lion's share of ""Poltergeist"", do they? Anyway, I reckon if Goldman WAS involved, it was only to polish up a few minor details. The bulk of the screenplay has the air of being written partly from experience. I think the criticism the lads received may just have been jealousy from the Hollywood establishment at having the temerity to nab their first Oscars so young. In all areas, not just the script, ""GWH"" stands out as being a quality product.<br/><br/>The guys deserve great credit for tackling a serious issue with their first screenplay and not merely filling the script with a lot of scatological humour (Though there is some of that here too, it just doesn't seem out of place) All of the characters are well rounded and sympathetic in some way, and you never feel they are there simply out of formula or to further the plot. The development of the story grows organically through the characters. Even Skylar, the love interest (played beautifully by Minnie Driver, as too are the rest of the performances great) is an interesting character in her own right and someone we want to follow through the story. The only measurable difference between her role and that of Matt Damon's is that he has more screen time, but this is understandable, given that he is the title character.<br/><br/>In reply to those who say that the repeated profanity use highlights a lack of writing skills, I disagree. Often I DO think that repeated swearing is unnecessary to a story and unimaginative; not that it offends me, it doesn't. I do think that film-makers look at the success of a guy like Quentin Tarantino, who writes great dialogue and also uses a lot of profanity, and think that the former is because of the latter. It isn't. Here, the profanity seems natural. Look at the monologues given to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) I think they are superbly written, and they contain very little profanity. Same goes for Stellan Skarsgard's dialogue.<br/><br/>There are 3 scenes that stand out as being superbly written for me (not necessarily in chronological order)<br/><br/>* Will's monologue about why he doesn't want to work for NASA<br/><br/>* The scene with Skylar when he tells her of his abuse<br/><br/>* Sean Maguire pouring scorn on Will's supposed 'life experience'<br/><br/>(paraphrase) ""Someone that could level you with their eyes,<br/><br/>Wakin up every mornin' feelin' like God put an<br/><br/>angel on earth just for you...""<br/><br/>On a sombre note, I can relate to the above quote because it mirrors what I feel about a 'special someone', who I unfortunately can't be with. Still, personal identification aside, these are all wonderfully written.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant also does an under-appreciated job with the direction. It seems like he realised that he had a good script on his hands and he didn't want to ruin it with any needless showboating. Even though there are no visual acrobatics, I would bet that almost every scene came off better than Matt and Ben envisioned when they were writing it.<br/><br/>Deserves to be seen at least once by everyone.

","Good Will Hunting was written by Matt Damon for a film class in college. At the time, he did not even think he had put all of his potential to use. Despite this, Matt Damon crafted this masterpiece, and it fittingly marks the beginning of his very successful film career. <br/><br/>Will Hunting is a genius who seemingly has misused his talents. It seems he is not motivated to pursue his talents and instead takes a carefree method of going about life. He often is getting in trouble and is surrounded by the wrong kinds of people. It turns out Will is facing a problem much deeper than lack of interest, which requires the help of a therapist (Robin Williams). Will Hunting's chemistry with Robin Williams defines the rest of the film. The genius of Will Hunting is clearly present but it never shines due to his psychological problems. His relation with his therapist allows Will to develop as a character, which is particularly nice to see. The film is shot really well with some emotional scenes. Even though the character of Will Hunting is portrayed as a difficult person to deal with, I was able to connect well with the character and his growth. <br/><br/>As with his later movies, Matt Damon was saved against insurmountable odds. However, here is saved psychologically from his traumatized past. Good Will Hunting surely saves Matt Damon just as he begins his remarkable Hollywood career."
"Wuchakk","5","3","5","12 September 2013"," F***, Will Hunting (the character) isn't that f***ing good
","I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film. If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).<br/><br/>The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down. <br/><br/>For one, Will Hunting is not a ""good"" person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, ""What the f*** do you want?"" Could anyone be that stupid? How about, ""Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?"" I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film. <br/><br/>In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived. <br/><br/>I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama. <br/><br/>Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows. <br/><br/>The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested. <br/><br/>Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, ""Good Will Hunting"" is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsg√•rd is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).<br/><br/>Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.<br/><br/>The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"
"WestAct","5","3","5","15 April 2000"," Feels like it was written by two guys in their mid-twenties. Oh wait...
","Good Will Hunting is a very frustrating movie.  It feels like it should be good, and I very much wanted it to be good, but it never quite reached that point.  A movie with so much going for it--a good cast, a great setting, and an interest basic story--shouldn't be as simple-mindedly written as Good Will Hunting is.  Hardly Oscar-worthy, the script plays more like a final assignment from a first year screenwriting class.  Almost completely lacking in invention and subtlety, the script seems aimed toward the lowest common denominator of the age group that wrote it--in this case, early to mid-twenties.  While the movie is not completely devoid of meaning or entertainment, there is so little of either one present here that the movie is only worth watching if you don't know there are a number of better and more mature ways the story could have been told."

","I know I'm against the grain on this one, but I truly hated this movie to the point where I almost walked out. I had absolutely no sympathy for the Matt Damon character. He's not mentally ill, rather he's a spoiled brat who needs a slap on the face. He treats everyone badly through his own self centeredness--the point is we are supposed to believe he has changed at the end. Not to give the ending away, but he's as self centered as ever as the movie closes, and that is what I found so annoying about the story. Indeed, everything in this movie was annoying from the downbeat girlfriend to the mawkish Robin Williams, who spouts some of the most embarrassing dialogue I've ever heard.

It's about ¬ñ not them but guys similar to them: young, intelligent, but very insecure concerning their future. I guess, this is how many script debuts are like. Luckily, they found some good actors with Minnie Driver and Robin Williams and a famous director, so they managed to make a solid movie that doesn't get boring and makes you think about life. It's a small film, with no particular peculiarites (except the fact that Will is a maths genius, a fact that doesn't dominate the film as much as I believed before I saw it). This makes it even more remarkable to me that it became so successful and won two Oscars. 6 stars out of 10."

","Thank God for Jay Mohr and the short lived series Action. At least they had the courage to directly, on-the-air, from other Hollywood players, lambaste this monstrosity of a<br/><br/>script that went all the way to the Oscar's!<br/><br/>Bad scripts come and go. Just part of life. Giving them Oscars as Best Screenplay is criminal.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are fine human beings and good looking guys living great lives.  They just can't write to save them, that's all.<br/><br/>The barroom debate scene between the snooty student and the self educated Damon is merely the most pretentious and stupid scene EVER to portray itself as having any connection to reality whatsoever. Why didn't it get THAT Oscar?<br/><br/>This awful film was a top ten grossing movie in 1997. That's the really scary part.  This bad a film does that well. And it's not an action flick, it pretends to be an intellectual flick with an important message!  As you read this, if you didn't see the gruesome falseness of the barroom debate scene, just remember that your really dwelling some place far out, but nowhere in the real world.  I bet you liked Blair Witch.<br/><br/>A very distant second in the removed-from-reality category could be Jason Robarbs in the ""senior partners take a shower together scene"" in Philadelphia.  But that's not really close to this masterwork.  One can also think of the Happy Days episode where Fonzie and Richie go to a snooty rich people's party and are treated so badly.  Another worthy contender. Several episodes of The White Shadow perhaps? James At Sixteen? I'll wager young Matt and Damon loved those shows!<br/><br/>The bar is set. That barroom debate scene may not be the worst thing ever filmed.  But it is certainly the most intellectually pretentious and cloyingly stupid scene ever made.  No surprise to finding Robin Williams in this film. How did he let them leave him out of this scene? Oversight."

Gus Van Sant also did a good job adding feeling and color where dialogue was absent. Hell, even the score chosen was appropriate for the scenes they portrayed. Williams did a tremendous outshine everyone job acting, and even Afleck and Damen were far from shabby.  And as much as we all like to hate Driver, she too was ok I guess.

"rmax304823","6","6","14","31 May 2003"," Manipulative and Heartwarming
","SPOILERS. <br/><br/>I can see why this project was greenlighted. It's got everything a Hallmark feature should have -- plus profanity. A love story between a brilliant lower-class boy and a young girl at Harvard. (In the original ""Love Story"" it was more or less the other way around.) A tortured boy barely out of his teens who is a miscreant and unable to expose himself to others and who is not ""in touch with his feelings."" (I've always wondered how you get in touch with your feelings.) Well, it's worked dozens of times before -- ""Blood Brothers,"" ""David and Lisa,"" inter alia. <br/><br/>In this instance he's wary of others because he was abused as a child; cf., any of two or three dozen Lifetime Movies for Women. A very human but somewhat remote academic mentor, and a warm, humanistic, unpretentious bearded shrink, as in ""Ordinary People."" A score that tells us when we're supposed to laugh and when we're supposed to tear up. Good, evocative location shooting in Boston. Is Will Hunting going to be able to overcome his fear of commitment, leave Beantown, and find himself emotionally and intellectually? (How do you find yourself?) <br/><br/>We viewers want him so badly to choose the right path, which we can discern amidst the murky and myriad possibilities even if he can't, that we feel like we're watching someone trying to shove a boulder and we find ourselves sitting in our seats and humping along with him. Does he make the right choice? Does a bear hibernate in the winter?<br/><br/>Well, I'm sorry. I kind of enjoyed the first half hour or so, when Will Hunting's genius is being finally and painfully uncovered. It was kind of confusing though, in a technical sense. Mathematics is one of those creative talents that appears at an early age, rather like genius in music. It tends to peter out in early adulthood. (If you haven't made it as a professional mathematician by the time you're twenty-five you're considered over the hill in academia.) In other words, mathematical genius has a life course of its own, almost, but not quite, independent of what is generally recognized as ""intelligence."" But Matt Damon, as Will Hunting, not only has this isolated talent, but something that resembles a photographic memory as well. He's remembered practically everything he's ever read, which is practically everything ever written, from law to organic chem, although we never see him reading a book. If a kid in my working-class neighborhood ever was caught reading Nietzsche, he'd be twitted to death. <br/><br/>Well, eidetic imagery (or photographic memory) really does exist. You can hold up an ordinary comb in front of a kid who ""has"" it, for a few seconds, then put the comb out of sight and the kid will be able to tell you the number of teeth in the comb, because the image in his mind is so clear that he can count them. But, like musical or mathematical genius, it shows up early, in young kids, then tends to fade. And again, it's independent of ordinary intelligence. For one individual, especially at the age of twenty-one, to have both singular geniuses at the same time, is so unlikely as to constitute an irritation for someone watching the flick. I mean, it's like drawing two straight flushes, one after the other. <br/><br/>And then too, it makes me squirm when I watch a scene in which a shrink brings up the abuse his client suffered in childhood and then tells him over and over (and over), ""It's not your fault,"" until the client breaks into a cascade of fulsome sobs and the two of them hug one another like Esalen grads. Who ever claimed it was the client's fault in the first place? Why in God's name should the client blame himself for the brutality instead of the foster fathers who are the guilty parties here? (Hint: the script calls for it.) <br/><br/>And there are shouted arguments between the academic mentor -- played in a most engaging way by Skarsgard -- and the humanistic shrink -- done devilishly by Robin Williams -- that seem to take place only because they add texture to the picture. Neither the mathematician or the shrink show the slightest evidence of being the shouting type. There's also a shouted argument between Will and his girl friend that isn't called for either, although a simple disagreement would have been plausible. <br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that this is a commercial product. It could have come out of a course in screen writing taken through Phoenix University. Introduce interesting characters with idiosyncratic traits, pull the audience in, then tug at the plot and the heartstrings. Have a scene in which an emotionally distant person finally breaks down and cries. In the last half of the movie, when the interest may be dying down, pump it up with fights between people we like. <br/><br/>This isn't meant as cynicism or a blanket condemnation of the talent involved in the production. Matt Damon is particularly good as a bragging roughnecked Southie. Contrast this performance with what he does in ""The Talented Mister Ripley."" When he and Williams have a quiet confrontation on a park bench, Damon gives the scene entirely to the shrink. Robin Williams does a fine imitation of Oliver Sacks. (Why does he choose so many other poor vehicles?) <br/><br/>Van Sandt handles the direction competently, but see ""Drugstore Cowboys"" for a more personal Weltanschauung, in some ways just the opposite of the one presented here. It isn't nearly as heartwarming as ""Good Will Hunting,"" thank Bog."

","I had originally reviewed this movie a year after I saw it, and in my review, I gave it restrained praise.  'Does it have it's flaws. Yes. It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature'. After rewatching, I have to take those two comments back.  It didn't seem too long during the second viewing, and Minnie Driver's character had real depth, something I had missed on my original viewing. <br/><br/>  However, one thing that I have to comment on is the script.  It felt much better the second time around.  Damon and Affleck have a natural ability to create dialogue that flows, almost like lyrics to a song.  None of it seems forced, and it becomes quite moving in several scenes.  The scenes between Williams and Damon are so well written, and are acted very precisely, they become quite powerful.<br/><br/>  The music also works quite well, something else that I overlooked in my first viewing.  I'm glad I watched it again, and it's status had certainly risen in my mind."

","How many handsome mathematical geniuses working as janitors and whose ambition in life is to get drunk and get into as many fistfights as possible have you ever met in your life? <br/><br/>The main problem with Good Will Hunting is that the main character is as believable as Godzilla or Forrest Gump: it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to swallow Will Hunting's behaviour and motivations. At least Forrest Gump was a nice guy: Will Hunting's attitude, which is supposed to be the product of an abusive upbringing and therefore ""not his fault"", gets on your nerves after a while. Sure, it's satisfying seeing poor Will defy the establishment figures (judges, psychiatrists and snob rich college students) and getting away with it. For a while. Too bad this get boring after a while, with the viewer always ahead of the story until the predictable finale. But as long as you don't think too long about the implausibilities of the movie's setup, the story is convincingly acted and reasonably well-told, though director Gus Van Sant doesn't show any of the offbeat touches that marked his earlier efforts (the closer he gets here is a weird slow-motion courtyard fight).<br/><br/>Robin Williams is fine as always, and more restrained than usual; the rest of the cast is adequate, though I would have loved to see more of Stellan Skaarsgard's math professor, easily the most interesting character."
"TheCasualReviewer","10","2","3","10 December 2019"," ""That boy is wicked smaht.""
","If there is any film that you can call ""perfect"" it's this one.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS:
Will Hunting (Matt Damon) seems to have everything you'd want from unparalleled intelligence to incredibly loyal friends to the most loving girlfriend, but even with all of this Will still keeps a wall between him and everything he cares about. A life that would appear to be so simple, is in fact a lot more complex than it seems.<br/><br/>DIRECTION:
Gus Van Sant directs this thing to near perfection. Through his direction there is so much life and grounding added to a story that otherwise seems quite plain. Knowing at which points to change the focus of the camera from one character to the next. Knowing when to hold a close up to really cease a beautiful scene and capture the expression. Now, I'm not going to sit here and act like no one else could've directed this film, however, a film like this could've easily been ruined by poor directing and editing. Great work.<br/><br/>WRITING:
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really knocked this one out of the park. Not only was both of their acting on-point, but the dialogue in the film is so pure. There are so many memorable moments in this film just from incredible dialogue. It feels as if there's not a single line in this film that goes unnoticed or should be cut. If the heart could write a script I'm pretty sure this screenplay is what would be the result. This film definitely deserved the Best Original Screenplay Oscar that it won.<br/><br/>ACTING:
It's not your fault. It's not your fault. I swear Robin Williams had me screaming ""I KNOW, SEAN!"" followed by aggressive tears from the guilt I felt that I never actually had a reason to feel, but damn you Robin Williams. On top of that, Matt Damon, how dare you memorize ridiculously intellectual monologues like the one at the Harvard Bar scene and the one that cut from you being at a job interview with the CIA or whoever to you being seated in Sean's office. I'm starting to feel this is an autobiography. Are those just books? I don't know. Shut up. Then moving on the Ben Affleck who is my dream best friend. One I can confide in and a man who will willingly go to my job interviews in an over-dramatic BAHSTON accent acting as a pretentious. Yes, please! Minnie Driver. That heartbreaking scene over the phone... ""I love you."" Say it back... SAY IT BACK, WILL! What a killer Irish accent by the way. Not an Irish bone in my body, but trust me... killed that accent. Stellan Skarsgard, I understand how much you care for him Stellan, but he doesn't want to be a damn mathematician. Do you know how easy it is for him?! DO YOU? And Casey Affleck, stop worrying about your damn double burger. I do have to acknowledge how resourceful you were with that baseball glove though. *Tips the hat*
I realize I just pretty much reiterated lines from the film, but the acting is so damn good that I don't even know what else to say. It's so amazing. I will say this film does possibly have the worst performance of anyone ever, however. Professor Lambeau's assistant. He looked and sounded like he was continuously trying to put himself asleep during every scene he's in.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
This is my favorite film of all time. Though the directing is anything to go crazy about, the writing and the acting in this film, elevates this film to an entire different dimension for me. I can watch this film on repeat 24 hours a day. Actually, make that like 16. Sleep is essential to get another productive 16 hours of Good Will Hunting. That's my review."

","I watched this movie for the third time today and it was just as powerful to me, if not more so, than when I saw it upon its release.
Gripping story and characters.
Superb acting all-around.
Robin Williams earned every ounce of his Oscar and his grand performance here is one of the great efforts in movie history. It's one of those roles that should be replayed every year at the Oscars ceremony along with Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca and Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain. Williams is not the lead actor but his interplay with Matt Damon in the key scene near the finale is one of the best film history has to offer us.
As most should know, Damon wrote the script with a young Ben Affleck. Affleck's younger brother Casey has a solid supporting role as well. Cole Hauser, who acted with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in the 1992 film School Ties, has a small role but makes an impression. Hauser also acted with Ben Affleck in Dazed and Confused (1993) and I assume must be a real-life friend of both.
Minnie Driver is really great in a difficult role.
I have a small problem with a couple of the lines which I won't give away. There is some tongue and cheek humor and a few things that might seem implausible today but were realistic in 1997.
The brilliance of the writing, the youthful energy and the power of the performances (along with a great soundtrack that features the haunting songs of the late Elliott Smith) make this a landmark film for a generation - especially those who came of age in the 1990's."

For the ears in particular, as FANTASTIC, deep, meaningful, powerful dialogue pours out of the mouths of the stars.<br/><br/>Ironically, when I first watched this - not too long after it was made - I felt annoyed and exasperated with Damon's character Will Hunting (hence the clever nature of the title). I just got fed up with someone that gave so little back to (or actively abused and rejected) 4+ great (if of course quite flawed) human beings who were prepared to devote so much time and unrewarding effort.<br/><br/>This time round I'm more charitable. Will is a genius that leaves supervising Prof. Lambeau (Skarsgard) in awe, jealous, admiring, and above all immensely frustrated. For Will comes from absolutely the wrong side of the tracks, and yet is a mathematical genius the likes of which Harvard/MIT have never seen, yet is listless and aimless and drifting over to the bad instead of the good, because of fearful psychological experiences from childhood that psychiatrist Dr Maguire (Williams) seeks to help him with, mostly to no avail.<br/><br/>So Lambeau has his academic and other reasons for going the extra mile, the latter's old schoolmate Maguire has his occupational commitment (though both are strained to and beyond the limit by their pupil-patient), but the Minnie Driver part (Skylar) just has her love for Will - and his throwing that back in his face hurts us even more than the other rejections. Seemingly most complacent and non-judgmental is Will's co-worker on the construction site and drinking and free-time buddy Chuckie (Affleck), who ultimately stops being easy-going when he shakes Will by saying that his non-gifted, worker pals EXPECT Will to make what he can of talents they would give anything to have.<br/><br/>All the interactions here are exquisitely, searingly well-observed and magnificently well-written, but the genuineness of the Affleck-Damon dialogues are the ones that hit home most of all, reminding us of the remarkable kindness and insight and true understanding that can at times exist in real life among ostensibly non-intellectual, tough-exteriored working-class men.<br/><br/>For most of the movie, it seems that none of these helpful and well-meaning interventions is going to cut any ice; and indeed the happy ending may look a bit too cute. However, we would have found the whole thing very tough-going without it.<br/><br/>In any case, the film is indeed an almost excruciatingly erudite work of intense meaningfulness and genius, and a no-possible-shirking must-see for those who haven't."

The extremly good and complex written character of Matt Damon, what is also based on the great screenplay. 2nd...the few very deep, emotionally and well played Scenes between the Matt Damon Charactor and Robin Williams/Ben Affleck and his Girlfriend.

","I'd been wanting to watch this movie forever, but I never felt like it was the right time.
Yesterday however, I finally sat back to enjoy myself a nice movie with some of my favorite actors (Damon and Williams). I enjoyed it, but in a very different way from what I had expected. 
I went through a rollercoaster of emotions. I laughed, I cried (a lot), I got frustrated, and sooo much more. This was, for me, definitely the right time to watch this movie. It's mostly about finding yourself and what you want in life, and I think I really needed to hear many things that were said in the movie. It opened my eyes, and my mind and I already know that this movie's going to have a huge impact on the rest of my life.<br/><br/>I absolutely love everything about it.

","Will Hunting (played by Academy Award Winner Matt Damon) has a brilliant mind. He can solve any equation and loves to read school books, thus he is very smart. He is also there for his friends, particularly his best friend Chuckie (played by Academy Award Winner Ben Affleck). But he is also very young and reckless. After one too many brushes with the law, Will is placed in jail, but he is offered a way out: study mathematics while his professor (played by Stellan Skarsgard) tries to get him job offers and he will get psychiatric help. After going through many psychiatrists, he finally meets his match in Sean Maguire (played by Academy Award Winner Robin Williams). Whilst doing these math problems and going to appointments, he also meets a beautiful young woman named Skylar (played by Academy Award Nominee Minnie Driver). All of these people are amazing people who are there for Will. The question is: Can he figure out his own problem before he pushes them all away?<br/><br/>This is a beautiful movie. Plain and simple. The editing...the music...the song ""Miss Misery"" by the late great Elliot Smith...there are so many things that are worth mentioning here. But let's start with the writing. I said that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won Oscars in their career. Well, it was for this movie and it was for their writing skills. This is the movie that put both actors on the map and they have done it in a way that nobody else has ever done. There is a lot of swearing in this movie, yes, but it is essential to the story. It's an amazing thing, the writing in this movie; they were in their twenties and they both wrote this movie as if they had been doing this for a long time. An Oscar that was well deserved.<br/><br/>Also worthy of praise is the great Gus van Sant. While he hasn't directed a lot of films, two of the three that he is well known for show his greatness as a director (Every director has their own personal ""Psycho"" remake, unfortunately). While he was also nominated for his direction of ""Milk"" in 2008, it's this film that shows his strengths as a fine director. He knows what to do; he is a hands-on director. One such example of his hands-on approach is the painting in Sean's office. That painting was painted by van Sant himself. It is just a small but vital example as to how van Sant knew what he was doing. Honestly, he should have gotten the Best Director Oscar that year.<br/><br/>Speaking of well-deserved Oscars, let's talk about the cast here. The two main cast members that were not nominated for Acting Oscars - Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard - both do an outstanding job nonetheless. If Ben Affleck's movies have convinced you that he can't act, check this movie out. Without a doubt, he pulls it off. And Stellan Skarsgard pulls it off as a professor who just wants to see Will succeed wherever he's at. But let's face it: there is a reason why Damon, Williams and Driver got nominated for Oscars. They are the true standouts here. Driver is so much more than just a girlfriend to Will; she has her own backstory and, although it is only briefly mentioned, you can tell that it is an important moment in her life - a moment that has defined her. Driver definitely should have gotten that Oscar. Damon is also amazing in the main role; there are a couple of scenes where he gets to me, particularly one where he truly reveals what has happened in his past. When he reveals what has happened in his past, it is very clear as to why he acts the way he does - why he pushes people from his life. Damon portrays that inner conflict very well in a role that should have landed him his first Acting Oscar (no disrespect to Jack Nicholson, though).<br/><br/>However, the standout performance is that of the late great Robin Williams. A lot of people remember him for his comedic roles like Mrs. Doubtfire, Aladdin and Good Morning Vietnam. Some remember him for his dramatic roles in Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, One Hour Photo and Insomnia. Some remember him for his adventurous roles in Hook and Jumanji. But this...this is my personal favorite performance that he has ever done. He is able to tone done his crazy antics for the most part, but when he does up the crazy a bit, it is certainly viable to the scene. But that park bench scene and a certain scene towards the end are my two favorite scenes that he has ever done.<br/><br/>While I spent a lot of this review giving credit where it was due, I do have to end off by saying: Thank you, Robin. Thank you for all the magic that you have given us. Thank you for the laughter, tears and smiles that you gave us through your amazing performances. I am truly sorry that you could not find that joy within yourself, but I hope to someday see you up in Heaven with God and the rest of His Angels. Just remember: it's not your fault."

"pepyx-48591","6","2","3","1 May 2017"," It was... OK
","Goodwill Hunting is a generally well developed moralistic story that focuses specifically on the development of the character Will Hunting. However, I feel that story and characters are sometimes detailed to an unnecessary level and that the movie included scenes that does not aide necessary character or plot development. Without doubt one of hallmarks of the movie is the energetic but, at first, semi-aimless Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Taking on the role of a widower-psychologist he casts light on Will's life and assumes the position of a wistful father who knows all the answers. He helps guide Will; unlike other characters in the movie (mainly Gerald Lambeau) does not attempt to force a life upon Will.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the movie is the conflict. At first, the movie appears to be an example of man v. man (Hunting v. Lambeau) as Lambeau tries to push Will to become what he never could; as the story develops it changes into a man v. himself (Hunting) situation. The man v. himself conflict is eventually revealed when Sean Maguire opens Will's file to pictures of bruising. <br/><br/>Continuing, the setting of Boston was one of the best choices made by the directors. It was a prime location as it is home to some of the best universities in the world like Harvard and MIT, both of which were used in the film. It therefore was a good setting because it provided a good backbone for the movie plot of a disadvantaged but bright youth, Will Hunting to be discovered.<br/><br/>Acting in the movie was adequate on average only because of Robin Williams; without Mr. Williams, it was rather subpar. The major downfall of the acting being the attempt at accents. Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and the rest of the gang (despite being from Boston) heavily over accentuate their speech in a way that distracts from the movie. The same can be said for Skylar. The accents do not add to the movie and almost distract from the plot. Aside from the accents, the actors do a perfectly fine job but (again excluding Robin Williams) seem to lack the magical ""something"" that truly makes the audience fall for a character. Robin Williams, as mentioned, was the exception to all this. His character is exuberant and portrays the role perfectly.<br/><br/>While the acting may have not been of the highest quality, the cinematography was excellent. The director's frequent use of extreme-close-ups and close-ups make the viewer feel more emotionally connected to the characters by bringing us physically close to them. Another example of great cinematography is when Will burns his math proof paper and the professor falls to the floor to catch it. The director uses a high-angle shot that shows the professor in a position of vulnerability but Will in a position of power as he is shown above him.<br/><br/>Finally, what brought the whole the whole movie together was the music. Just as music in any movie, it was quiet enough not be consciously noticed but loud enough to still be noticed. It added to the overall nostalgia and highlighted the emotions meant to be felt in each scene.<br/><br/>The movie has good scenes but they are often lost in the flurry of other scenes. The acting is OK but not otherwise positively noticeable. The camera shooting was excellent as well as the setting. In the end, good directorship and Robin Williams made this a perfectly average movie."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","12 November 2016"," One of the defining mentor-student movies
","""Good Will Hunting"" is an American English-language film from 1997, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is possibly the most known work by director Gus Van Sant and it brought him his first of (so far) two Academy Award nominations. The second came for ""Milk"" and I really really adore that one. But back to this one we have here. The script was written by lead actor Matt Damon and supporting actor Ben Affleck and the duo won an Oscar for it. Damon was also nominated for Lead Actor. Minnie Driver was nominated for Supporting Actress and the late Robin Williams won his Oscar for supporting as well. Other than that, the film scored nominations in the music categories as well as Best Picture of course. It was possibly the movie that catapulted young Matt Damon into the elite of Hollywood actors where he has stayed to this day, almost two decades later. He plays a young man with incredible talent in all kinds of intellectual areas, but his character gets in the way of fulfilling his potential and becoming who he can become. This would be an accurately short description of the plot here.<br/><br/>The other players in this film are his friends, his mentors and his girlfriend basically. And the actors received a great deal of awards recognition for what they did here. However, I personally am fairly disappointed about how much Stellan Skarsg√•rd was basically ignored by awards bodies as he was truly as good as the rest of them who got recognized. All in all, this movie that runs over 2 hours and managed some great success despite the Titanic domination that year is a success. It has a heartfelt moment here and there and it is competently crafted. Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsg√•rd shine next to Matt Damon and I was honestly not that impressed by Driver for whom it's probably her career-defining performance. Yes, it is very much by the book and also predictable with the events, but this does not take anything away from its appeal. Damon certainly gives one of the best performances of his career. It's minor quotes that make a great effect here, like the one by Williams' character about why our hero chose to be a janitor at specifically this place or Affleck's character's quote near the end about how he cares about the protagonist fulfilling his potential which honestly came a bit surprising, but still felt authentic. Damon and Affleck showed later on in their careers how great they are when it comes to writing and Affleck also in other fields, so everybody who sees this duo as nothing but actors could not be more wrong and this film is a perfect example of their skill. They sure deserve to be where they are.<br/><br/>I personally found it a bit sad to watch Williams in here because of how much his character is struggling and the actor was probably struggling at least as much in the final years of his life. It is just pretty difficult to ignore that. At least for me. However, I am still glad he got the recognition he deserved for his turn here. He is definitely one of the better aspects of these two hours. This film scored a huge deal of awards attention as I already said and it is also very highly rated here on IMDb, easily inside the top250. I would not go so far to say it is one of the very best of 1997 I think, but it is certainly among the better films of the year. And it is also not among my personal 250 favorite films, but that's not a problem either. All the struggles I had with this film were mostly subjective I think, for example I did not like Damon's character as much as they wanted me to and as a consequence I did not care for him that much either. And the struggles between the two intellectuals in the film also added very little, even if the two actors were very good. This should not imply that I was dissatisfied in any way with how the film turned out. The good definitely outweighs the bad and I give this one a thumbs-up easily. It's also closer to a ****/***** than to a **/***** and maybe if the second half of the film had been as good as the first, then it may have achieved the former. Overall, it was a rewarding watch. Go see it if you are one of the few who have not yet done so after all these years."
"smacdoug","Null","2","3","28 September 1998"," Matt Damon sticks to the formula in this cliche ridden drama.
","Haven't we seen this one before? Matt Damon must have looked at everything that's won awards in the history of the Academy and included every cliche he could scavenge into his screenplay.<br/><br/>1. The angst-ridden genius who resents his gift, because everybody he knows is trying to force him into a better life. A life he doesn't want because he's happy just being an average loser like all his friends.<br/><br/>2. The teacher who discovers him, who we are meant to believe genuinely wants to help him, but by the end we find out just wants to live his own lost dreams vicariously through his prodigy.<br/><br/>3. The psychiatrist who has troubles of his own, so by the end of the film they unwittingly help each other out.<br/><br/>4. Of course a romantic interest has to be thrown in to create the standard conflict. Should he choose a life with his friends, his girl, or a high paying job. Naturally he chooses to abandon everything and run off to a girl he barely knows. I hope I'm not the only one who saw that coming a mile away. Men are always portrayed as saps in these types of films.<br/><br/>Robin Williams gives us another one of his trademark two characters. He's always either manic and over-the-top, or quiet and introverted. In this case we get the latter, essentially the same guy we saw in Awakenings. I prefer him in the manic roles, at least then I don't have to suspend my disbelief enough to accept Mork giving psychological advice."

The authenticity of every performance is as good as it gets, especially from Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and Minnie Driver.

I point at my husband and yell ""ya suspect - - ya you!!"" at least 5 times a day. I'll never forget Sean's (Robin William's) wise words about not really arriving at a place of true wisdom until you know what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. Until then you're just (wicked) 'smaat' and spouting out facts you've memorized from books you've checked out at the public library. I think it is such a beautiful coming of age story and it stays with, and matures with, the viewer in every season of his/her life. I can't think of another movie that has been so refreshingly authentic, so chalked full of perfect one-liners, so genuinely reflective of what it means to be a student of academia and the real world, and so powerfully representative of the magnitude of having someone just believe in you."

"thomasmitilis1995","9","1","1","17 April 2020"," IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT...
","PROS:The writing of the movie is impeccable (the screenplay written by Damon and Affleck!!!). It is a story about a genious man with a traumatic childhood who believes that he knows everything because of his intelligence but in reality doesn't allow anyone to be close to him aside from his friends and dismisses every gift that he has been given. Matt Damon portrays this troubled young being impressively well as an arrogant and selfish man in the beginning but in the end he eventually lowers his defense in a emotional way.
The perfomance of Robin Williams is flawless. He shines in lots of scenes and specifically when he puts Damon's character in place by telling him that he sneers at moments that he has no real life experience (monologue in the park). He is the man that guides him to move on with his life but also learns to keep his own wounds behind.
Ben Affleck gives a strong perfomance by playing a supportive friend who desires the best for his buddy. Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver add more complexity with their portrayal into Damon's character.
CONS:The way that the movie depicts the intelligence of Will Hunting is a little forced and unrealistic"

","There's a very warm scene in the movie.
Dr. Thorne mentioned a small detail about his dead wife.
One of his wife's worst faults is that she always farts when she's asleep.
The wife herself did not know this.
Once, she made so much noise that she woke herself up. She simply asked her husband, puzzled, what was that noise? Is that the dog barking outside?
Dr. Thorne nodded. He didn't deny it. He didn't have the heart to embarrass his wife, so he put up with the little flaws.
He said:
""It's those little things that make her my wife. And she knows all my little flaws. People call them imperfections, but they're not. That's a good thing.""
In fact, there is no absolutely perfect person in the world, when blaming each other, who can guarantee that there is no shortcomings?
If you magnify your shortcomings, your marriage will be dragged down one day. Only by tolerating each other and embracing each other can you be truly fulfilled and happy.
After all, the truth about marriage is never 1+1=2, but 0.5+0.5=1.
When you walk down the aisle, everyone has to throw away half of themselves to accommodate half of each other.
Therefore, edges and corners are to avoid, otherwise, will hurt each other, will hurt themselves.

","The plot of the movie is hopeful, curious, naive, optimist, and aspirant. It is a memento of the brilliance that can be found on the hidden corners of our society, when we possessed far more hope than we do in our current times. I watched this in 2020, and the plot sells the idea of a kid that has an extraordinary ability to grasp information, as if knowledge just magically arranged and rearranged in his mind. It is beautifully hopeful. Two features swayed my sensitivities: the brilliant performance by Robin Williams, and the intriguing moments when we saw Will Hunting deliver versed dialogue.<br/><br/>The profundity of the psychological exploration of Will Hunting's mind was present for any viewer that wants to watch a multi-dimensional character. It is as if you expected in every scene for him to demonstrate his superior understanding, adding it with a brusque punch of crudity. Robin Williams as his therapist allowed us to see a window of not only his temerity but also his sensibilities. We understood from the beginning that what he valued was loyalty above everything, to the point that he would be willing to sacrifice his gift and stay with his friends. He also had a strong sense of justice and morality. His aspect of suffering that connected with abandonment complemented really well to create a character that, despite being extraordinarily intelligent, had difficulty participating in the most mundane of activities: be in a relationship.<br/><br/>His ability to be incisive with his analyses allowed him to achieve notoriety, but that did not help him to deconstruct and solve his most intimate problems. The addition of a partner showcased all these features, even after all her captivating features, despite her being ambitious, ingenious, and charismatic, he saw defects in her. Metaphorically the contention of love and intelligence was a central part of the movie, to the point that Will decides to direct himself through love rather than intelligence. Lambeau symbolized the path of intelligence and notoriety, while Sean Maguire symbolized the path of love and acceptance.<br/><br/>If you are considering watching this movie you will find excellent dialogue and a story that anybody can relate to that compares personal achievements with the acceptance oneself and mediocrity."

","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give very good performances in this film but the thing that baffles me and I can never seem to understand is why they won an Oscar for this screenplay. Not that the screenplay wasn't good, it was. But why did THEY win? As far as I gather all Damon and Affleck wrote was the first draft of the screenplay. But their version was some sort of horrible action film about a math genius on the lam from a crooked government trying to exploit his talents, involving high-speed car chases and buildings exploding etc. It wasn't until William Goldman, an experienced screenwriter was hired, that the film became this ""inner-growth and maturity"" story that eventually got released. Goldman wrote the bulk of the screenplay alone and didn't even get credit as a script-consultant. As far as the credits of the film are concerned, he wasn't even there. Of course Damon and Affleck came up with the main-character and some of the stuff in the script themselves, but they did not write the script that was actually filmed. And it really makes sense. How could two such inexperienced writers produce a first screenplay of such quality and go from rags to riches literally overnight? Sounds exciting doesn't it? Just the kind of story Hollywood likes to tell. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck give even better performances in real life than in the film itself.

","I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best ""drama"" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.<br/><br/>All in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

","A very good film, if somewhat unfulfilling and light in regards to the unexplored relationships from Will to Sean and Skylar. Robin Williams shows the beginnings of his serious, and sometimes darker, side. Matt Damon shows excellent promise, while Ben Affleck fumbles along as he has in many of his roles since. Still, it's a moving tale with some heartfelt scenes, particularly the defining moments between Will to Sean and Skylar."
"andy67uk","7","4","9","23 December 2001"," Promising screenwriting debut but an overrated movie.
","A good piece of screenwriting by young cast members Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but one that I don't think will stand the test of time. Matt Damon's (Will) performance as the troubled working-class genius in need of guidance is excellent. However, I think that this was too much of a feelgood movie and an endorsement of counselling, for it to be a truly great film. I found Minnie Driver's (Skylar) expressionless English accent thoroughly irritating and it destroyed, for me, the possibility of the romance between Will and Skylar being interesting.<br/><br/>The performances of Robin Williams (Sean Maguire) and Stellan Skarsgard (Professor Lambeau) are good. The patient-therapist relationship between Damon and Williams is played well by both actors. The films flaw is that it lacks real depth of characterisation. There is a good story in this movie, but it lapses into classical Hollywood slushiness with all ends tied neatly together. Some characters, such as the pseudo-intellectual student who Will runs rings around while chatting up Skylar and a friend, are pretty one dimensional as he is someone we can easily mock and despise, just like the lapdog (what's his name?) who follows Lambeau around.<br/><br/>There are few profundities in this film and I find the idea that therapy is what is needed to help a troubled young prodigy out of his predicament rather spurious. We are also shown how Will's initial hostility to therapy as part of his probation is surrendered. While one would not wish Will to remain an angry young man with no direction, I find the belief that therapy can necessarily mediate the relationship between an individual and society too hard to swallow."

","GOOD WILL HUNTING is a good movie, no doubt about it. The story is great and intriguing and told well. The performances and writing are good. But it is NOT this great movie that everyone makes it out to be, not in my opinion at least. It was fun and enjoyable, but I found it to be nothing groundbreaking. It is not even Gus Van Sant's best film. And the title is so stupid, right? I think it's supposed to be a pun about hunting for goodwill or something, and the character's name is Will Hunting, which I think they just did for the title. I hate when they do that, like with that movie JUST WRIGHT and a bunch of others.<br/><br/>The story is even a bit unbelievable and feels fake at points, and not in a good way. But overall, it's still a good movie. The dialog and acting are great, especially from Robin Williams.

","Every once in a while, director Gus van Sant gets sappy, and movies like ""Good Will Hunting"" are the result.<br/><br/>The director of terrific films like ""To Die For"" and ""Paranoid Park"" is nowhere in evidence in this story about a math phenom (Matt Damon) working as a janitor while a bunch of dumber and richer kids get all the good stuff life has to offer. Robin Williams plays a counselor, Minnie Driver plays a love interest and Ben Affleck plays a best friend. The film launched the careers of Affleck and Damon, who won an Oscar for writing the film's screenplay. But the screenplay is one of the worst things about the film, full of lines and speeches that maybe looked good on paper but aren't at all believable as things people would actually say in any version of reality I know.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, but not one I'd waste any more time on, and certainly wildly overrated.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

"Movie-12","6","3","6","28 February 2001"," Inspirational and enjoyable style, but too much of the film is recycled. **1/2 (out of four)
","GOOD WILL HUNTING / (1997) **1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>The tremendous, puzzling critical and public praise ""Good Will Hunting"" received utterly astounds me. What has America come to in order to get such great satisfaction out of a movie like this, jumping back and forth between presumptive concepts and a shameless plot; Gus Van Sant directs a script by Matt Damon and Ben Afflect, who think they are much better than they are. The two screenwriters actually took home the Oscar in 1997 for their work. But why? The movie certainly has an inspiring style, and if you do not try to hard you might find yourself having a good time watching it. But with more thought this script could have actually been worthy of the Awards it caught.<br/><br/>The movie takes place at a Boston University where we meet an egotistical and youthful janitor named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Nobody would ever guess beneath his tough and cocky attitude, urges to get nowhere in life, series of problems with the law, and rebellious actions that he is the smartest individual in Boston, if not the planet Earth. It feels so customary, the most unexpected person in the university is the smartest. Most of us will not find ourselves surprised when we learn this character has a deeply troubled past.<br/><br/>Will Hunting beats the crap out of a police officer and finds himself with a demanding prison sentence. This is where the movie puts a new spin on an old clich√©: instead of a father pushing a rebellious offspring to live the life he wants him to live, here we have a college professor and a young janitor going at the notion. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) realizes this young man has an extremely complex ability to solve mathematical problems and offers Will an alternative to jail time. He gets the reluctant juvenile a kind psychiatrist named Sean (Robin Williams). The filmmakers use this character to inject a bunch of other irritating dramatic contrivances in the story, dealing with previous child abuse, professional competitiveness, alcoholism, social class conflicts, jealousy, remorse, and guilt, but Damon and Affleck use these as predictable and formulaic tools to grab our emotions. They come off as amateurish and intractable.<br/><br/>
Will is emerged in self-discovery when his relationship with Sean stabilizes. He also meets a nice, charming young girl (Minnie Driver), who provides the plot with some romantic tensions. Her character's presence is needed so we can actually witness the impact of his counseling. But Will's moral awakenings are hammered in our heads. It's like the filmmakers did not think we could figure things out on our own so they felt the need to spell things out. This is absurd; most audiences can perfectly see the intentions and emotional turmoil Will is going through. This movie insults our intelligence.<br/><br/>The plot and theme of this movie hinge too much upon the idea that it is difficult for an intelligent person to move from low-class to a honorable member of society. This is why the contrivances are so obvious. Even after some of the thoughtless writing, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make the amazingly egotistical choice of starring in the film themselves. Both are talented actors, and Affleck does no harm here; his character does not make much of an impact. It is Matt Damon who is one of the biggest examples of miscasting in recent movie history.  Damon does not look like a tenement citizen regardless of how hard he tries. His performance is riddled with indolent character traits, like smoking and the frequent use of profanity.<br/><br/>
Damon's character is also spectacularly aggravating. He originates no sympathy because Will is such a selfish idiot. Why should we root for him to succeed if he does not want success himself? Granted the character has a traumatic past and troubled emotions, but none of those things are executed in a convincing method, therefore it is up to Damon to fill the character with inspiration and livability, but I hated, hated, hated Will. I wanted Robin Williams to put a fist in his mouth. Is this what the filmmakers wanted, for us to despise the main character?<br/><br/>Damon makes the performances by Stellan Skarsgard and Robin Williams standout. Robin Williams inhabits the only sensible character here; I felt so good when he kicked Will out of his office. No wonder he won best supporting actor at the Academy Awards, he is terrific. The performance captures his character's emotional and comical perspectives. Sean is also supplied with an absorbing circle of being, depth and dimension. Damon's character also perspires of such material, but Will seems to be altered for the script's needs. One scene he is ambitious and defends his friends, other times he is arrogant and cocky, yet sometimes gentle and charismatic. Minnie Driver is also charming, but her character also feels somewhat controlled. She is a plot puppet, but at least she portrays the character with personality and zest.<br/><br/>Most of the movie has an enlightening and pleasant style, and if you are not too critical this movie does achieve its own goals. With so many problems with its plot, characters, and borrowed material, it's startling that ""Good Will Hunting"" feels uncluttered, organized, and so entertaining and human at times. But even the good substances contribute to a plate that may be a just bit too full for prosperity."
"MayhapsItWasGoodBackThen","1","8","24","15 August 1999"," Good Will Hunting is simply one of the best films I've ever seen!
","I won't reveal anything about the plot, it just wouldn't be fair. But I will say one thing: Unique screenplay and great actors always guarantee a memorable movie. And this film makes no exception to that. I've never seen Matt Damon in any other film before this, and I have to say I was simply blown away by Damon's superb acting and his and Ben Affleck's first-class screen writing skills. Robin Williams is the right choice as the unconventional psychiatrist, Will's friends all do a great job and Minnie Driver plays an excellent role too. Good Will Hunting is at the same time funny, fascinating and touching, and avoids turning into an embarrassing study of how human mind really works. Even clich√©s don't feel like clich√©s in this brilliant film. These kinds of movies really make your brain tick. Well.. Mine at least.<br/><br/> As a closure: GO RENT THIS MOVIE ASAP!<br/><br/> (You won't be disappointed or if you are, blame yourself for not understanding a masterpiece when you see one.)"
"moonspinner55","7","5","13","20 October 2002"," Quite good, except for a bogus ending
","Barbed script full of ""F--- you's"" doesn't seem like a likely candidate for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar, but this one did win and I think the performances are the reason. The acting here is so strong--particularly by Matt Damon, who co-wrote the thing--that I believe it makes the writing seem better than it is. There are some terrible sequences that can be blamed on the script, direction and editing, such as the bit where Damon's friend Ben Affleck substitutes for him at a job interview. However, the acting usually rescues it, with Oscar-winner Robin Williams pensive and endearing as a psychologist who becomes therapist and mentor to closet-genius Damon. Minnie Driver is also excellent as an unlikely love-interest for Matt, but the finale is almost too hokey to believe. In their efforts to tie this all up with a big satin bow, novice writers Damon and Affleck sink their modest little ship just as it's about to dock. Too bad. **1/2 from ****"
"MartinHafer","5","8","25","5 June 2005"," As long as you realize there are LOTS of errors in the movie, it is entertaining
","This movie got lots of kudos when it came out and most of them were deserved. The acting is exceptional and in some ways the writing is fine as well. However, given my background as an individual therapist, the movie is a mess psychologically speaking. First, although I generally like Robin Williams in the movie, his physical attack on the main character (though deserved) would result in him losing his license. I have felt like hitting many clients--particularly sociopaths like Will but it just can't occur in real life--particularly since a guy like Will would also be the type to make sure the police and licensing board found out ASAP! Second, given that Will is a sociopath (he has all the signs of an Antisocial Personality), he would not be cured by the end of the flick. Many therapists feel that antisocials cannot be successfully treated while those who DO feel treatment will help would never think about doing short-term therapy with such a vicious powder keg. The movie is pretty good but the sappy Hollywood ending ruins the movie and gives the general public very unrealistic expectations about therapy."

","Good Will Hunting It is a touching story about a wayward boy and his healing. Though a love story at heart, it does not make for the basic premise.<br/><br/>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an undiscovered mathematical genius. He is well read, lost young man working as a janitor in MIT, where he is discovered by a professor. Through the guidance of his psychiatrist (Robin Williams) he finds his calling, falls in love and begins his journey for a better life. <br/><br/>Matt Damon as Will Hunting has done full justification to his character. You feel every moment with him. His insecurities and vulnerability is touching while at the same time his mask of sarcasm is arrogant. Robin William sails through his character as a psychiatrist. He is not a mentor but becomes a father figure to Will. His personal trauma and healing is beautifully handled. The dynamics between Robin and Matt make for some of the most memorable moments of the movie. Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard have also shined in their small respective roles. There are some moments in the movie which stay with you even after. Gus Van Sant(director) has done a very good job. Moments like wills final break down or his confrontation with Skylar are powerfully packed yet subtle. <br/><br/>The film is brilliant with a first class performance by everyone. There are no dull moments. The chemistry between the characters is plausible and realistic. The writing is witty yet deep. The movie does not evade the tougher questions yet manages to not bring down the mood. Overall, this movie is a definite keeper."

","What can I say about this film? It features one of the greatest screenplays of the last 20 years, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, full of thought-provoking dialogue and some beautiful monologues, (My personal favourite is from Ben Affleck at the construction site about 3/4 of the way through the film). All the actors are great. Matt Damon perfectly embodies the role that he plays, an immature, cocky yet gifted boy in a world which he believes will wait for and build around him. Robin Williams plays an empathetic, yet gloomy psychologist who has never fully gotten over the death of his wife. Even Ben Affleck-haters will acknowledge Affleck's good work here, as Will Hunting's seemingly bonehead friend, who, as the film goes on, is revealed to be caring, empathetic man. Minnie Driver, Casey Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard round out the cast, all of whom give good performances. The plot is something many of us can relate to: An overconfident, intelligent man who cannot be bothered to realise his full potential. The insecurities of Will Hunting are fleshed out in great detail by the script, Damon's performance and Gus Van Sant's use of close ups for a lot of the major scenes, showing Hunting's emotions in detail. However, in some of the crowd scenes, such as in classrooms, Van Sant lacks a little imagination, resorting to the same camera pan sequence over and over again. Nevertheless, he is a more than capable director who delivers for the most part here. Danny Elfman's use of music adds to the heartwarming factor of the film. The film won two Oscars, Robin Williams winning Best Supporting Actor as well as Damon and Affleck winning Best Original Screenplay. In addition to this, Damon, Van Sant, Driver, Elfman and editor Pietro Scalia, earned nominations for their efforts. The film was also nominated for best original song and best picture. I would recommend this film to anyone, however, parents should be careful with letting their children watch this, as it contains a lot of coarse language as well as frequent sexual references. A superb work of modern drama."

","This film is definitely overrated. It wasn't badly directed or edited, and held your interest. But when you think back on it, uh-uh. Some parts that didn't go over well: Matt Damon, in an earlier scene, beats another tough guy to a pulp during a brawl on the basketball court. Later on, he gets manhandled by the out-of-shape Robin Williams and looks scared to death as the older guy has a grip on his throat. It was also unintentionally funny, right before this incident, when Robin Williams tells him he can bench press 280 lbs. In your dreams, pal - you are a small, hunched over, out-of-shape middle-aged dude. Also, Williams' character was ready to kill Will because he disrespected the memory of his deceased wife. A short time later, he laughs as he describes how his late wife loudly farted all the time, even in her sleep. How endearing.Then there's the scene where Matt tells off a stuck-up guy in the bar by giving him a history lesson from 1770. Like, anyone in a bar cares. Then, he gets Minnie Driver's phone number and it's a big trophy; an accomplishment. You would need very thick beer goggles to ask for her number. Then, there's the math whiz stuff where he connects the dots on triangles and it's like he he invents the theory of relativity. Also, Damon is a genius about everything......was he from Krypton??"

","There is clearly a mix of glowing and scathing reviews here, so I might as well put my two cents in. So what do I think of it? The concept did not really ring true.<br/><br/>The protagonist is an undiscovered genius who is able to figure out things that stump even the geniuses, such as a complicated mathematical problem, even though he works as a college janitor. He has a poor background and emotional problems from a bad childhood, plus a girl interested in him, yet instead of breaking out of his miserable existence he initially wants to stay in it...but is convinced to change his mind.<br/><br/>So what went wrong? A genius might have a rough existence, but he acts like everybody else around him except for his magically solving complicated mathematical problems. Um, anyone who's so much smarter than his peers would show signs of it that nobody could ignore, such as being able to say and do things most others wouldn't think of. Why couldn't he have become, say, a professional gambler (degree not required)? Why would he cause trouble and not be able to charm his way out of it. Will Hunting is a genius and does not behave like a genius in real life would, no matter his background. That spoils the movie for me."

","Will Hunting is a young genius born on the wrong side of the tracks. Living in the rough streets of Boston and constantly in trouble with the law, the future bodes none too bright as the only paths that lay ahead seem jail or menial labor if he's lucky. In a fortuitous twist of fate a distinguished and lauded professor who teaches in the same university he janitors for discovers his towering talent and desires to see him attain the heights he deserves. But the shackles of the past clamp too hard, and Will proves reluctant and difficult in the brisk change. Enter Sean Maguire, a professor/psychiatrist with a past who proves more than a match for the smart but obnoxious and headstrong Will and the eventual relationship that would test both men as they discover themselves and develop a deep bond that liberates them both. Perfect casting, flawless acting, a seamless script and excellent directing make this an instant classic and a prime example on the inimitable standard of American cinema. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (who also controversially co-wrote the screenplay) deservedly became stars with this and became media and public darlings leaving a lasting legacy that endures to this day.

"charbelelaro","10","2","4","2 April 2019"," The realism and authenticity is unbelievable
","Today I am ending my birthday on a high by reviewing my all time favourite movie. Good Will Hunting Directed by Gus Van Sant, contains such an incredible screenplay written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The plot is simply based on a genius who isn't living to his potential due to the traumatic impact of his past. For a topic which has been attempted countless times in film history, Good Will Hunting still holds the benchmark. Each and every word of the script is perfection. Moments of outrage as well as moments of therapy contain some of the most well written lines in cinema. Robin Williams' performance was truly inspiring. His line delivery has a way of transcending the screen and connecting with the audience on a deep, emotional level. I say this is my favourite film due to the fact that it is talented film making in its barest form. All that is required is a great script and talented performances, in order to create such a timeless film. This movie holds up incredibly well. Age hasn't made it less powerful or emotionally outdated. This is one of the very few films which actually impacted my personal life and changed my mindset. The bleak visuals together with Elliot Smith's melancholy music, establishes such a beautiful, sorrowful tone throughout the entire runtime. Not once do I ever believe I am watching a film whilst sitting through Good Will Hunting. The realism and authenticity is unbelievable. If you haven't seen Good Will Hunting, you're currently deprived from one of the greatest films in history. This film repeatedly leaves me in awe each and every time I experience it. Good Will Hunting is undoubtably a 10. I recommended reading through screenplay after watching the film. It's an absolute masterpiece."

Gus Van Sant's direction is near perfect, and the outdoor sets are all nice to look at.

Stellan Skarsgard is also great as the Maths professor at University. Minnie Driver (Hunting's girlfriend) is also adorable and believable. And Robin Williams deserves a very special mention, because he not only gives a very strong performance, but he also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (the only Academy Award in his long career).

","Good Will Hunting is an impressive movie on many levels not the least of which is the screenplay written by it's two young actors. One of the best scripts ever to be put on film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Will Hunting (Matt Damon) an orphan from South Boston who spends his nights bar hopping with his friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), and his days working as a janitor at MIT.<br/><br/>There, the illustrious Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgaard) teaches high math to his students. To challenge them, he puts an impossible problem on the board with the promise that whoever solves it will win the prestigious Fields Medal of which he, himself, is a recipient.<br/><br/>When the problem is solved within a week by an anonymous genius, the student body is baffled, and Lambeau sets out to find the elusive prodigy.<br/><br/>He erupts into Will's life just as the latter is about to be sent to prison on an assault charge, and convinces the judge to release the boy into his custody with the condition that he see a therapist.<br/><br/>Will is against the idea, and treats his first five therapists with utter contempt (providing some of the funniest scenes in the movie).<br/><br/>In desperation, Lambeau turns to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) a former roommate with whom he has never gotten along.<br/><br/>With some effort, Lambeau finally coaxes Sean into seeing his new prot√©g√©.<br/><br/>Sean, a widower who has never gotten over the loss of his wife, finds this new patient to be a challenge, while Will realizes he can't play his silly games with this particular therapist, and either has to fish or cut bait.<br/><br/>Adding tremendously to the movie is the presence of Skylar (Minnie Driver) who almost immediately falls in love with Will, and is crestfallen by his inability to admit his own feelings.<br/><br/>Back when the Oscars used to mean something, this movie was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and received two of them which it deserved completely.<br/><br/>This is a movie that has depth, and meaning.
There isn't anything that could be added or changed.<br/><br/>It's a perfect little jewel.

"srshapi","Null","2","4","4 October 2013"," Good Will Hunting. Coming-of-age story.
","The skeleton of the movie Good Will Hunting is predictable but the scenes have great dialogue and character development. This is specifically concerning scenes with Sean and Will. The first scene with Will and Sean shows Will with all of the power as he disrespects his new psychotherapist, Sean. Sean quickly resumes power by the next scene they share together, as Sean sits Will down and tells him that he is willing to work with him but only if Will stops hiding behind his knowledge in books and exposes who Will Hunting really is. One of the final scenes between Will and Sean ends with Will crying in Sean's arms, showing Sean as a father figure. So, although this may seem quite predictable, Good Will Hunting still contains scenes between the two main characters, Sean and Will, that are captivating and something viewers are not used to seeing. <br/><br/>The first scene Sean and Will share together starts off with them making small talk. Will's motive is to have Sean hate him, so he does not have to see a therapist. So, Will starts to dissect a painting that Sean has in his office that, coincidentally, Sean painted himself. Will says the painting must represent Sean's loneliness and postulates that he and his wife are distant in some way. The second Will disrespects Sean's wife, Sean pushes Will against the wall and chokes him while telling him to never talk about her again. We see character development with Will during this scene, as he lets his mouth go and expects no consequences. The second he receives a consequence ‚Äì Sean choking him ‚Äì Will does not know what to do or say. We see character development with Sean as well. The viewers now know how important his wife is to him. This scene is also shocking. During a first meeting, viewers wouldn't expect a therapist to choke his patient. The viewer, therefore, knows immediately from this moment that Sean and Will's relationship is far from ordinary.<br/><br/>The second scene Sean and Will share together is Sean giving Will a speech about how Will lives his life through books and because of that, he hides behind them. The speech is very compelling because of Williams' acting. He is quite inviting towards Will but at the same time he is teaching him a lesson. Williams expresses this through the tone of his voice ‚Äì it is very soft and he hardly raises his voice. During the scene, Will takes in everything that is being said to him. He knows not to cross Sean and that is shown through Will not interrupting Sean the entire time he is talking. This speech is one of the pivotal points of the movie because it is an analysis of the main character, Will. <br/><br/>One of the final scenes Sean and Will share together starts with Sean telling Will that it is not his fault that he was beaten as a child. Sean says this as a father figure, which confuses Will because he never had that growing up. Will shrugs Sean off but Sean keeps insisting that it was not his fault. As Sean repeats these lines, Will begins to break down and pushes Sean out of the way. Sean continues and eventually Will gives in and cries in Sean's arms. This is out of the ordinary for a normal therapist-patient relationship. Sean and Will have broken that relationship standard and have entered a friendship level, something both of them need. <br/><br/>The screenwriters, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are actors who coincidentally are both in the movie, so their vision for the characters they play are very clear throughout the movie. This is great for Damon's character, Will, because the movie revolves around him. Having the screenwriters participate as actors in the movie very much enhances the scenes and the character development because it is indeed their vision. However, there are many parallels to the lives of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to the lives of their characters, which one could argue would obviously create good dialogue. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck grew up together and most likely participated in these actual dialogues in reality. Therefore, it would be very easy for them to create and become these characters because, in some aspects, they are these characters. Nonetheless, the scenes with Will and Sean together make the movie worth watching because, as it stands, character development happening before one's eyes is entrancing."
"ellieforpeace","6","2","4","11 July 2009"," The Title Really Sums it Up (In a Dreadful Way)
","I'm one of the few people not crazy about this movie. I always have this problem with older, iconic movies. It feels like I've seen this type of thing better before, but I'm never sure if that is because this movie started it. In the case of Good Will Hunting, it's kind of old, but not old enough to create the old clich√©s.<br/><br/>This is the story of a young, genius janitor, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who has issues. Growing up in south Boston is hard and all that, and Will was given a gift he didn't ask for, and a life that he's unnecessarily proud of. His little reality is shaken when he meets a psychologist (Robin Williams) who matches his life, and a woman (Minnie Driver) who matches his wit. And you get the dreadfully punny title, Good Will Hunting.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the pun that gets me off to a horrible start. The screenplay doesn't make me feel much better. It is filled with clich√©s. It seemed like every little life lesson was spelled out for you, as if you couldn't be trusted to distill it from the movie yourself. Every little thing Robin Williams says feels like a ridiculous monologue by an amateur. Which really is what this is. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay, their first. I really have no idea why it won best screenplay at the Oscars.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, however. Ben Affleck isn't always convincing, but he's got that whole look and atmosphere of a hometown boy. Minnie Driver is spectacular. She really captures the emotional turmoil her character is put through. Gus Van Sant directed this film, and despite the simplistic dialogue that is put forward as the most important part of the movie, he rescues it. The silent parts are often the best, like when the boys ride back from Harvard, and soft Elliot Smith music plays. That was the first transcendental moment, and a few more follow, elevating the movie to a place it really wouldn't be otherwise. Although I had problems with the Elliot Smith-dominated sound track. Every time something was supposed to be touching, they played Elliot Smith. It was tiring and monotonous, and by the end, I could basically start singing the music before it came on.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, it's just rather corny, rather predictable, rather run-of-the-mill. I suppose that the story is a bit different, and showed people something they had not seen and considered. Matt Damon's character is a bit of an enigma, a genius who shies from his gifts, and the reason why he makes sense. It's a great character study. But his ""salvation"" from his self-designed fate, is commercial and forced, and makes too many decisions and judgments to be really great."
"annmason1","6","2","4","10 November 2006"," A Rose by any other name would still start with F
","Again, like ""Midnight Run"" this movie is dented with bad language. Yes, maybe people like these guys do use the F word every time they exhale, but then again, I think it's a stereotype. I mean, where's the lobby for foster-kids-on-their-own? I resent the stereotype that poor ""Southie"" kids are vile, that they can't speak without that word. It's far overdone.<br/><br/>I like the story. I do like the fun concept of an underdog gone good. I like someone who can out-brain the brains; but I agree that Matt Damon does not have the persona to pull it off. Ben Affleck would have been a better choice. I think Damon was chosen as the main star because he is less handsome and charismatic than Affleck. They wanted to get Damon in the door of public awareness first.<br/><br/>Oh well. It's a fun movie if you can tune out the words. Robin Williams has perfect timing in his interactions with Will. The baseball scene is wonderful. <br/><br/>All in all, a good film; too bad the language hurt it."
"nattylap2","5","2","4","28 March 2005"," slow moving and witless
","This film moved at a glacial pace. The concept that a street tough is an undiscovered genius is difficult to buy in to, but it is an acceptable premise. But it was the stilted dialog and the superficial plot that undermined the whole idea. It took what seemed like forever for anything to happen.<br/><br/>Worst of all was Robin Williams as the psychiatrist who finally turns Will Hunting's head around. His agent must have told him that this was a role in which he could overact to his heart's content. <br/><br/>And the love story amounted to little more than boy loses girl, boy gets girl."
"XRANDY","Null","2","4","3 August 2001"," Didn't work for me
","In order for this film to work you have to possesss some sympathy for Matt Daiman's character.  I didn't so I didn't care for the movie. Basically he was an ass.  I did like Robin Williams however and would say that his performance adds a redeeming quality to a rather sophomoric script."

","Often, when a Robin Williams character is the most palatable feature of a film, the film may be avoided and the filmgoer's admission may be saved and the filmgoer may enjoy $7.00 worth of candy and cake (There are exceptions - ""Dead Poets'"" is one, of course).  Good Will Hunting doubtlessly sold lots of issues of Teen People magazine - but it also kept a lot of good filmgoers from enjoying a lot of good candy and cake.<br/><br/>-That's what I think."

","""Good Will Hunting"" is a film that pulls at the heartstrings of the viewers. Written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, this film focuses on the life of Will Hunting. Will is a troubled young adult trying to find his place in the world. Spending most of his young life in a dead-end job, Will lashes out at the world. After solving a complex math problem, Will is forced into therapy by a mathematician who cant help but be impressed with Wills' natural ability in mathematics.
Forced into therapy, Will lashes out at every therapist to drive them away. This is when we are introduced to Sean who is played by the great Robin Williams. Sean has a unique insight into Wills life. Will in unaware that Sean had the same lifestyle as him growing up. Sean posed a question in the early meetings ""What do you want to do?"" Will is unable to answer this and you can see that it bothers him tremendously. After many months of sessions, will is finally able to trust Sean and he opens up about his problems.
The therapy seems to work both ways in this film. While Sean is trying to help Will he ends up facing his own demons in the process. This was a great way to show growth in both of the characters.
The culmination of this film is when will goes to see Sean to let him know that he is leaving. He notices that Sean is also preparing to leave on his own journey and simply leaves a note for him at his door. The note is sort of an inside joke to them both. The last time we see Sean is here where he says that Will stole his line.
The color used in the movie consists of mostly neutral tones. The office that Sean used had a warm inviting amber color and the camera work was perfect for the scenes they were trying to create. They did an excellent job showing that Will came from nothing and had to struggle to make ends meat. In fact they even go as far to show that he was embarrassed of how he lived and how little he could afford.
Overall, the movie is a great weeknight watch. It draws you in rather quick and allows you to identify with Will and Sean. It hits a cord that people don't always want to face in themselves and makes you ask what do you want to do?"

","Disillusionment is a profound luxury, for a library has been built over the blood of many, similarly unendowed, and dissimilarly acknowledged for their worth, for a little word in either context while creating ripples in the immediate surroundings of one could set fire to an industry in the other for not being able to contain the ripples in an age where fishes are finned at sea only to be grilled on land. This interpretation is starkly evident in the climax where the pain of guilt is neatly suspended for a new lease of life shelved abruptly back home by those who call dibs at being the underdog at leading with the chin at subliminal treachery."

","It is not a tragic movie, but it makes people tearful; it is not a friendship movie, but it makes people yearn for true friendship; it is not a psychology documentary, but it makes us think about the general psychological predicament of contemporary people. .<br/><br/>The movie, like its name, can salvage the softest part of the human heart, just like Professor Rambo told Will over and over again, it tells us: a lot of things, not your fault.<br/><br/>People who are intelligent and sensitive in their hearts are good at creation and accumulation at the same time. In Will's heart, too much bitterness accumulated, first abandoned by his parents, and then sent to foster care four times, three of which were severely abused. The broken childhood shaped the sensitivity in his character. He used the harshest words to ridicule the world, but he did not want to open his heart to the person he loved.<br/><br/>As Gu Chengshi wrote, ""In order to avoid the end, you avoid all the beginning."" In order to prevent others from touching the scars deep in his heart, he refused the treatment of the psychologist. This separation between the subconscious and others from the very beginning makes him not believe that his girlfriend, Scella, really loves herself.<br/><br/>Accepting your own imperfections can reap the inner lightness; embracing the incomplete past can open a brand new future. It is often impossible to predict in advance who we meet in life, but who we establish contact with depends on ourselves.<br/><br/>No one can be flawless, Jia Pingwa said: ""The genius has its strengths and weaknesses, and his weaknesses are extremely short. The peacock also exposes his butt when it is most beautiful."" But who we choose to let us enter our world is to allow others to come in through their own cracks and defects. The mind should not be a shackle, but a key to open each other.<br/><br/>But Will is lucky. Beside him, there is a mentor called Shane, who told Will: ""It is those small flaws that make you meet the right person."" Everyone has some small flaws, which people call ""imperfect."" ""But Shane said, '"" It is them who choose to let us enter our world. ""<br/><br/>Therefore, perhaps none of us need to be disturbed by the intimate relationship being established. You are not perfect, but some people are willing to accept your imperfections unconditionally, and you are perfect for each other."

We have created all kinds of perfection, but we don't stop there. Everyone in life is imperfect, especially in a close relationship, they will always see each other's deficiencies. Love needs these blemishes to adjust. A perfect love does not mean that two people are perfect personality, but that two people can get along happily even if they have flaws. So, no matter what kind of weakness, please accept it frankly, don't use perfection to pretend to be inferior. Face life bravely, love courageously, only then can life have no regrets"

","Good Will Hunting is an excellent movie. The movie touches upon many aspects of human life. It shows fear, friendship, love, potential, pride, and sorrow along with many other aspects of human life. Good Will Hunting shows real human struggles, and real human triumphs. It has a great deal of genuine humanity for a film.
Good Will Hunting follows a young troubled genius named Will (Matt Damon)who lives in Boston. As the movie starts Will is working as a janitor at MIT. One of the Math professors at MIT writes an incredibly challenging problem on a chalkboard in a hallway and challenges students to solve it. Will solves it after hours and the Professor sees him but Will runs away. Will then hangs out with some friends and gets in a fight. He is going to be sent to jail when the Professor tracks him down, and gives him two conditions to be let out of jail: meet with him for math once a week, and meet with a therapist once a week. Will accepts and this sets the stage for the whole movie. His therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and him continue to meet. Will is reluctant at first but he starts to trust Sean. Will also gets a girlfriend and starts to develop genuine feelings for her.
The movie has excellent characters and dialogue. When two characters talk on screen it feels like a real conversation. The way characters seem so comfortable with each other reminds me of the Oceans movies. The characters have realistic and consistent motives for their actions. The film also uses lots of humor, Will and his friends make fun of each other and the joking feels natural. Some scenes don't advance the plot but it doesn't feel like a waste because watching these characters just interact is captivating. There really aren't any major drawbacks of this movie for me. But it does use a lot of time to set the plot up. The story starts of fairly generic as well. When the movies plot gets going though and the climax is approaching I found myself genuinely glued to the screen. The movie's directing and soundtrack aren't groundbreaking, but they don't need to be for this film and they do their jobs well enough. The actors all do phenomenal jobs. This movie is some of the best acting I've seen from Matt Damon and Robin Williams.
The main strength of this movie is its humanity. It shows many challenges that real people face and it shows these challenges in a real way. The movie shows people dealing with the fear of the unknown and fear of commitment through the main character Will. Will also struggles letting people in and letting people know about his issues. The main struggles at the center of this movie are inherent struggles that come along with being human. Will may be incredibly genius but he's still easy to relate to. The way Will and his friends interact with each other is incredibly natural. Them arguing and joking in the car is incredibly fun to watch. But the best scene that showcases humanity in this movie when Will and Sean are sitting outside on a bench. Will starts cracking some jokes at Sean's expense but then Sean starts talking. Sean tells Will all the things he hasn't experienced yet in life, but the way Sean is doing it is outlining his own life. He's telling Will about the struggles that he's been through. The struggles that come with living a real life. Because the main lesson Sean wants will to learn is to not be afraid to live a real life and put himself out there. The acting in this scene by Robin Williams is immaculate. I've never seen anything done by him that tops this monologue. A Dead Poets Society rivals it.The writing in this scene is just beautiful.
Good Will Hunting is one of the few movies I've seen were the characters seem genuinely real and the movie is still captivating. It has that balance between cinematic moments and real human moments. I was sad when this movie ended because I didn't want to stop watching. I wanted to see more of these characters. The movie was centered around human struggles and human triumphs. This movie is a definite human triumph."
"coreyjacobs-09751","7","0","0","30 May 2019"," My thoughts
","Good Will Hunting was a good movie, it shows that love can go a long way and in all different ways. Will Hunting double thinks but ends up going with his gut, i thought he should of went with the girl before she left. I see me in Will Hunting i double think but i go and get what i want, people judge Will even though they don't really know him people do that with me too. He has a different way of doing stuff and he's underestimated by others.
People don't think Will Hunting knows what he's talking about or doing because he's younger than them. But Will Hunting actually knows what he's talking about and doing, he's a smart guy. It doesn't better how young you are if you actually know what your talking about don't listen to what people got to say. Age doesn't matter if you know what your talking about. Will Hunting is a person who doesn't care what people say about him he would still go and do anything to help himself.
The only thing i didn't like was the cliffhanger in the end of the movie. I just wanted to see if he really made it to her or even to see if he married this girl. I rate this movie a 7, besides the ending i liked the whole movie. Will Hunting went with what his friends said they told him to go with his dreams without telling them when he's leaving and that's what he did. It was a great movie and i recommend this movie."

","Let's face it: I hated mathematics at school and still do today, so the film didn't appeal to me in that sense, but it appealed to me in respect of life's lessons. I also enjoyed the film due to Robin Williams, whom I just love as an actor. This was a very dramatic and emotional role for him, which he did brilliantly. Matt Damon was also very good and believable as the young rebel. Ben Affleck's character was unnecessary and mostly silly and I found he ruined the scenes where he was present (although the character does give the best advise towards the end). Minnie Driver was also excellent as the love interest Skylar. She really gave a powerful performance.<br/><br/>As expected, although interesting, the film became dreary to a point where I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Due to the film's long running time, the events in the film didn't capture my attention enough to satisfy my movie experience needs. It did have a satisfying ending, though, as both Will Hunting and the psychologist (Robin Williams) gained from their sessions.<br/><br/>'Good Will Hunting' is regarded as one of the top rated films of all time (and, yes, I can understand why), and won numerous awards including two Oscars.<br/><br/>This is a film I'll probably never watch again, regardless of how well made and well acclaimed."

","Though Good Will Hunting was a very enjoyable movie, I couldn't help but feel that Will, is a bit of a superhero; He can win a street fight, and a mental fight, while taking on a psychological fight and an emotional fight, which too, he won. Then I later realized that perhaps, Will Hunting is, Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>Everybody was on Will's side, and because of that, he unfortunately came across as an unappreciative, immature, unnaturally lucky and somewhat spoilt little ass. However still, it was relatable to some extent. Having the potential to change the world, but having no one willing to fight with you and for you to realize that potential is a reality for so many... A lot of people have been given up on, and that can instill an immense amount of fear.<br/><br/>Robin Williams was awesome and Minnie Driver just well, drove it home. She was stunning, sexy and her performance just pulled you in. The directing was a tad bit choppy though, however it wasn't too distracting. The Affleck brothers and Skarsgard were also good. 7/10."

","The story of this movie begins with Matt Damon still in Harvard. He wrote the initial script for this movie as a class assignment. Later on he would recruit Ben Affleck to finish the script with him. And thus one of the most well-known films ever made was born.<br/><br/>And for such a humble beginning, the movie is much better than it has any right to be.<br/><br/>The story tells about Will Hunting (Damon), who's a mathematical savant and an all-around genius. Unfortunately he comes from the wrong side of the tracks in Boston and has thus ended up working as a janitor in MIT's math department. Until one day he's caught scribbling on the hallway blackboard. Scribbling such math that even the professors have a hard time keeping up.<br/><br/>The film isn't very heavy plot-wise. Rather it's the characters, these huge personalities played by talented actors, that make the film such a memorable classic. In Hunting you can definitely see clear signs that he was written by a schoolboy, but his problems are treated in a mature way and given enough depth that you care. The movie has some good thoughts about being gifted and the meaning your starting point in life has on your choices.<br/><br/>Plus the film has Robin Williams in it. This is not in fact one of his better roles, at least in my opinion, but the man was such a talent that even three fourths of his maximum effort was more than most could conjure up combined.<br/><br/>This film is best seen as a teenager. As an adult you can be a bit annoyed by Hunting's clear Gary Stu tendencies and the wish fulfillment talents, but even then it is more than a watchable experience and a neat piece of film making."

","Good Will Hunting is a dramatic, life seeking movie that centers around a young adult named Will with a unique gift in academics. Will is a janitor at MIT and his raw intelligence is discovered by a professor at the school after he was discovered to be the person that solved the infamous math equation that no one could solve that was left on the chalkboard in the hall. After getting arrested by police for getting into a fight Will is in danger of facing jail time but the professor at MIT arranges an agreement with the judge to keep an eye on him and make sure he spends mandatory counselling sessions. This was a tactic by the professor to try and groom Will to his full potential but you soon see that Will's problems stem much deeper than behavioral issues. The movie demonstrates Will's struggle to reach his full potential partly because of distractions in his personal life and his self-struggle with adversity and getting out of his comfort zone. At first the conflict is Man vs. Man but later on it turns into Man vs. Self which truly was the real conflict all along. I personally found this film to be very compelling and it quickly grabs your attention. The idea of a naturally gifted individual that has slipped through the cracks and became a janitor at a highly prestigious school and furthermore being able to solve extremely high level math equations after listening too a couple lectures here and there is extremely far-fetched; this is made up for by the genuine acting and the well put together script that captures true emotions and a heart wrenching story. The characters are well put together and there is an extreme character development in the movie. Will goes from a tough, underachieving, rowdy, belligerent boy to a young man with his priorities set straight. This is shown by Will leaving Boston to join his girlfriend Skylar in California as well as him finally opening up to Sean Mcguire (Robin William) who is his councilor. There is also an immense amount of symbolism in this movie. Will's house is surrounded by fences which symbolizes how his potential is trapped and he's not allowing it to go, that is basically the main conflict of the movie. <br/><br/>This movie was very dramatic when it came to the acting and how convincing it was down to the clothes on their back. Will is constantly wearing loose clothes such as jeans and dirty shirts to reflect his character; Sean is wearing your stereotypical teacher clothes such as a vest, dress pants and a formal button down shirt to reflect himself to the audience as a smart, educated man. Will had smug Boston accent that added to the realism of the movie and showed where he grew up. Skylar had a profound British accent that added to her character because it makes her sound more proper and intellectual. The scene when Will cried in Sean's arms really stood out for me, it captured the raw emotions and truly convinced me that Will was truly sad. Skylar and Will's fight scene was another truly riveting act that will stand the test of time, The anger and hostility that is reflected in his voice chilled me to the bones and Skylar's crying and her voice made it convince me that her heart was truly broken. <br/><br/>The cinematography In this movie was very good, each shot had a specific reason. When Will burnt the math equation that he had solved and dropped it on the floor the professor dropped down on his knees and grabbed the paper. The shot showed Will looking down on the professor which showed a strong sense of power that Will had over him. Will and Sean are not seen in the same frame together when they are in Sean's office until Will breaks down. this showed a lack of unification Will had with Sean and a lack of trust had had until he broke down. Before every new scene there was also a scene setting shot to show the audience where they were; whether this was a Birdseye view or a extreme long shot it really put you into the film. The music was not a big part of the movie as I had no memory of the style or theme of it. <br/><br/>Although this movie may not be the most realistic it is definitely a must see. The plot was interesting and the acting was at the least amazing. True emotions are shown and the deeper meaning in the movie is truly empowering."

","I think this film is good because of the exceptional acting, interesting characters, and a great plot. Definitely not my favourite, but still a good film. The film is a drama about a man named Will Hunting (Matt Damon) who is a janitor at a prestigious university and is found out by one of the professors that he is a math genius. He tries to get Will into a prestigious career because of his talents, but Will had a troubled upbringing and is afraid of failing and taking chances in life, and he receives help from a psychologist named Sean McGuire (Robin Williams). <br/><br/>In terms of the literary elements, the premise and plot are pretty interesting, and the main characters are complex and fleshed out, with a few exceptions. Will's girlfriend, Skylar, was given some depth in one scene near the end where she and Will are arguing, but that's about it. Also I find it hard to believe that she would even go out with Will in the first place, seeing as their first meeting involved him being a smug jerk to some random guy. The best character in the film, in my opinion, is Robin William's character Sean, the psychologist who helps Will through his internal conflict, and is an all-around great guy because he genuinely wants to help Will. Sean is a wise, intelligent character who serves as a father figure to Will. Will Hunting had some very interesting character development, but at the beginning and throughout the middle of the movie, he's a rude, smug, pretentious person, which are usually qualities of antagonist, but it was nice to see his character develop. <br/><br/>The acting in the movie was pretty good but some choices weren't the best. For example, Skylar being British didn't add much to the story, and while Will and his friends having Boston accents added to the setting, I found it hard at times to tell what they were saying. Will's friends were also a tad annoying in my opinion. Most of the actors did a good job of bringing their characters to life but Matt Damon and Robin Williams gave the most outstanding performances as their characters; Robin Williams even won an Oscar for best supporting role for this film, and I think it was well deserved. <br/><br/>In terms of cinematography, it was good, because the shots they used served purpose, but nothing special or new was brought to the table. There was an excess of shot/reverse shots and close ups in order to 'put the audience into a scene'. There was a long shot at the beginning of most scenes to establish setting. The music wasn't memorable at all, but at least when it was there it served a purpose to the mood the scene was trying to convey or it added to the setting. Also I felt the film dragged on a bit too long and the filmmakers absolutely could have made it shorter and more concise. <br/><br/>In summary, what this film lacks in exceptional cinematography and well-rounded love interests, it makes up for in having a great story and excellent acting, and I believe it is definitely worth a watch, though I don't know if I would watch it again."
"anthony-95476","Null","0","0","29 April 2017"," Film Overview
","Despite the plot of this movie being very predictable, I will talk about this later on, I still think this movie is worthwhile to watch. There is very good use of cinematography and you will really get to know the characters and discover things that they might not even have known themselves.<br/><br/>The main conflicts in this movie are internal, more specifically, ""Man vs Self"". The most apparent conflict is about Will overcoming his fear of vulnerability. During his childhood, he had been abused and did not get praise from his parents. This causes him to become very defensive with his life. He never wants to take chances because he is too scared that something bad might happen. For the same reason, he will push away anyone that he cares about before they can push him away; this acts as a defence mechanism since this way he feels like he is in charge of the relationship. <br/><br/>The reason that I claimed that this movie is predictable is because the plot of the story is written just like any other one. There is a typical young adult, getting drunk, getting into fights, etc. He requires some sort of assistance so that he can recuperate from a past experience, then an actor that is famous for giving life advice, such as Robin Williams or Morgan Freeman will show up and somehow have a connection to the character in need of assistance and end up helping. After a montage of the therapist talking and helping the person, he will realize that there is actually nothing to be afraid of and that he was living his entire life wrong; so he goes on to follow his dreams, and at the end of the movie he rides into the sunset. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>Skylar is a student attending Harvard that starts dating Will. She is very intelligent and very wealthy. She is astonished by how smart Will is. There are concepts that he can comprehend without breaking a sweat, while she can not understand it no matter what. She inherited a great sum of money from her parents' death, which allowed her to attend Harvard.<br/><br/>Sean Maguire is a psychology teacher at a small school. He grew up in the same neighborhood as Will, which is one of the reasons that he is chosen to help Will. Sean is used as an example of how a person can be born into a bad situation and still be successful. Even though Sean is supposed to help will, if becomes apparent that he can learn a great deal from Will as well.<br/><br/>Gerald Lambeau is a math professor at Harvard. He is an old friend of Sean Maguire from college. He is very arrogant and believes that he is better than everyone else, however, admires Will because he is smarter.<br/><br/>The main theme present in this story is overcoming adversity. Throughout the entire story, someone is trying to overcome something. Will is trying is overcome his fear of being vulnerable to being hurt; he tries to live his life as simple as possible, to avoid any kind of harm being done to him. Sean and Gerald have the adversity of convincing Will to use his talent to his full potential.<br/><br/>The setting of the story is Boston. Within Boston, there are many different settings. There are times it is set in MIT, this is where Will solves all the math problems. Another important setting is the bar, this is where Will meets Skylar; she is also the one that causes him to stop pushing everyone he loves away.<br/><br/>This story makes the viewer feel like they have a connection with Will. The story is trying to show that he is a person that does not know what to do with their life; this is something that everyone goes through at least once in their life.<br/><br/>When Will was is his old world, his house, his friends, etc, the colours were very cold and dark; and when he was with the professional world professors, school, etc, the colours were very warm and bright. This shows that his old world is very sad, boring, and pessimistic; whereas the professional world is very inspirational, happy, and optimistic.<br/><br/>Gerald always wore very arrogant clothing. This shows that he felt like he was better than everyone else. Sean always wore very laid back clothing. This shows that he is not very strict and is a person that people like to be around. Also, he had a beard, which showed that he is very old, wise, and knowledgeable.<br/><br/>There was an abundance of different camera angles being used in this movie. For every scene where you are supposed to be feeling a certain emotion, you can bet that you will be feeling it. For example, there is a scene where Will and Gerald were arguing; Gerald confessed that he is not as smart as Will, however, Will does not care and walks away. During this section of the movie, the camera was positioned below the eye level of Will, while it was positioned above the eye level of Gerald. This causes Will to seem more powerful and in control while making Gerald look vulnerable and helpless. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this is definitely a movie that you should consider watching. Even though you can probably guess the ending of the movie just by watching the first couple minutes. Getting to know the different characters on a deeper level and seeing the different sets that have been created, are all reasons that you should give this movie a try."
"junkmail-44276","7","0","0","27 April 2017"," Predictable plot lets down an otherwise great film
","(Spoilers) Good Will Hunting, was, as the title suggests, good. Matt Damon plays a realistic, if profane, twenty year old Will Hunting, who struggles to find purpose in his life, despite his uncanny math ability. This changes once he is arrested for starting a fight and forced into mandatory psychology with Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams). Throughout his therapy sessions, they form a bond and Maguire (predictably) convinces Will to do something with his life. The plot is predictable and clich√©, starting with the classic unrealised genius character and ending with his life turning out perfectly. This dull plot development does help create a realistic main character, but Will Hunting is already believable due to his dialogue and portrayal by Matt Damon. However, believability does not create interest. Many of the ""interesting"" aspects of Will are simply generic character archetypes. The orphan. The prodigy. Maguire pulls out the other parts of interest, but simply by stating them, and this should not be the case. Although one might blame it on the fact that Will is a self-guarded orphan and requires therapy for a reason, the film should not be so dependent on archetypes to make the viewers interested. Will's friend (who drives him around), on the other hand, had no clich√© background, and viewers learnt about his comradery and down to Earth approach through his honesty while he convinced Will into doing something with his life. The writers clearly had the ability to create interesting characters, so why did they have to rely on archetypes for main characters? Dialogue was spot-on and breathed believability into the characters, which makes it more painful to see such clich√©d mains. The symbolism was limited but effective, such as the train symbolising Will's previous one-track path through life, and then him receiving the car for his 21st, which allows him to go places he wants to, symbolising where his math ability can take him. However, these might not be related at all, and the car is simply there as an economically realistic way for Will to follow Skylar to California so the writers can tie up lose ends and finish the film in a positive, albeit predictable, way. The film shines when it comes to cinematography and camera angles, using a range of them effectively, such as the camera panning to a new location when a character enters the room, symbolising a change in tone. The film could improve on setting the scene, as many locations were ill defined. Many scene changes were set by a generic birds eye view of a standard city block, and then transitioned immediately to another scene, without specifying where that particular room was. For example, viewers never saw the building Maguire's psychology office was in, or the outside of the college he was a janitor at. However, that is one of the only areas for improvement. Warm colours are used in places where Will feels happy and safe, such as Maguire's office and Skylar's room. Cold colours are used in places like where he works to convey a sense of hostility. This can be expected from a Hollywood film. Dramatic elements are also used well. High and low angle shots are alternated between during fight and argument scenes to convey a power dynamic, and costumes accurately represent the personalities of the characters, such as Maguire's classic psychologist beard. There's not much to say about the dramatic elements, as they were effectively used. Again, something to be expected from a Hollywood film. This film has all the necessary dramatic and cinematic aspects to be a recommended view, but the clich√©d storyline lets it down where it needs it most. Relying on likable but archetypal characters and a predictable heartwarming ending, Good Will Hunting is likable and satisfying, but you don't need to be a psychic to tell how the film will end."

","It might be thought-provoking for some but it's certainly not a high rank piece of art. I think that acting and editing could be a little bit better (example: when one of the friends (a.k.a. brothers) came to Will's house, we can see as he smiles a little bit and in a different shot, a second later, he's deadly serious on his face). Also, it may give some kind of misinformation about how talent works, being gifted is super helpful but the most important part is practicing. All of the best pianists started at a very young age. There isn't any famous pianist who started at the age of 20 or so and discovered that he/she's a genius (while watching, you could get a thought like there is; maybe only Czajkowski but he's famous due to his creativity in music and not his piano skills). Will was practicing through logical thinking, so that's understandable in his case. However, it was mentioned a few times that he's learning because he's curious but when he was asked to work with the best technology in the world he denied (not everything is in library books) even tho he was fired from the school where he was supposedly taking more advanced materials from. One can justify that by saying 'he was too much bounded with his environment' but it seems to me far-fetched due to the fact that he had to really love mathematics to be that good at it (talent means that you're really passionate about something)."

It's been hyped up by so many people in the media, that the viewers are actually getting convinced that Matt Damon is the new miracle giving Hollywood new hope and glory, but it is quite the opposite. As an actor I think he's not convincing enough, maybe in the first part of the movie he seems to be able to let you forget he's just an actor, but at the end of the movie he starts to act out his character in such a way it actually brings down all what he did in the first part. As the writer of the screenplay he's not such a star either, again the beginning is okay, but the ending seems like a bad headache after a night of partying. The only truly remarkable thing about this movie is the excellent and undervalued performances by Robin Williams and Ben Affleck.

","When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people. It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with a I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequently when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable.

","After watching Good Will Hunting, I was struck by two similarities to other works of fiction (in this case, novels) that I had previously read: J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", and Stephen King's ""Rage"". Unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of those efforts, and didn't take to ""Hunting"" any more pleasantly.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film centers on young Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a mathematical genius (of savant proportions) who spends his time mopping floors at a local university before solving a complex equation left on a blackboard and catching the eye of a math professor (Stellan Skarsg√•rd). However, Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation, along with a history of violence, and thus is sent to therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who tries a rather unorthodox approach to salvaging the boy's unique talents.<br/><br/>Although I can see why some people would like this film much more than I (due to the deep psychological themes), I have never been one much for the ""bratty youngster needs a character treatise to understand what he is going through"" type of storytelling. To me, Will Hunting was an arrogant, unmotivated jerk in the beginning of the film, then a whole bunch of psychological terms/scenarios were thrown around, and now suddenly I'm supposed to believe that everything is okay? Not quite.<br/><br/>To me, the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting's potential girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver). I actually felt that her relationship with Will (and her character altogether) were the high points of the film, not the ""tense"" client-therapist scenes that were supposed to steal the show.<br/><br/>I realize that I am probably in the minority here, but I really can't recommend this film to anyone besides those who love to be wowed by psychological scenarios/situations.

","Directed by Gus Van Sant, Good Will Hunting is the story of a mathematical genius named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon. The film takes place in the campus at MIT, where Hunting works as a janitor. One day after his class is over, mathematics Professor Lambeau writes a problem on the board that took several MIT professors two years to figure out, and challenges his students to solve it. When Hunting sees the problem, he solves it by himself in a matter of minutes. The movie then unravels the genius in him, but also portrays his many weaknesses and his rough childhood. <br/><br/>One of my favorite aspects of this film is Hunting's relationship with the psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams. Sean is persuaded by Lambeau to council and give advice to a metaphorically speaking ""lost"" Hunting, after Hunting gets sent away from five other counselors. Sean asks Hunting some thought provoking questions that lead him to pursue the dreams of his heart. <br/><br/>Their relationship is like one of doctor and patient, as Hunting describes toward the end of the film. Sean tolerates him even after horrible disagreements and arguments they had with each other, and he never loses hope in him. Sean is one of the few people that actually understands Hunting, and why he does what he does. Unlike Lambeau, who often sees Hunting as an object of great power to be handled with force and control, Sean puts himself in Hunting's shoes and relates to him. For that reason, Hunting reciprocates this friendship and learns to trust Sean's judgement. A major portion of Hunting's actions at the end happen because of the advice that Sean had given him. <br/><br/>Another great aspect of this film is the dialogue. The dialogue between few characters in this movie flows very naturally and really moves the story along. Whether it's between Hunting and his three closest friends, between Professor Lambeau and Sean, or between Sean and Hunting, the dialogue is incredibly real. <br/><br/>A major theme in this movie is finding oneself, and finding what one really wants to do with his/her life. Talent and natural ability is one thing, but how will you use it? Will you just let it go to waste and stay comfortably in the status quo? Or will you go out and seek the adventures that your heart desires? Hunting has trouble identifying what his passions are, or what he wants to do with his life. When asked by Sean, Hunting cannot give a single straight answer. <br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this film doesn't have any flaws, though some parts of the film may not be entertaining for everyone, and the beginning starts off quite slow. Other than that, I think people who enjoy watching classic films will love Good Will Hunting.<br/><br/>After nearly twenty years since its release, Good Will Hunting remains one of the most powerful films ever made. This movie has a lot of heart, wit, and fun in it, though it revolves around a much more serious theme. This film is one of the few that can break your heart yet leave you smiling. Good Will Hunting is one of my favorite films of all time, and is definitely worth watching."

","This movie is genius. When robin williams passed away i honestly thought he was an overrated actor and considering his repertoire of ""RV"" and stupid movies like that one, I just didn't have too much respect for robin williams. but after watching this movie i felt dumbfounded to even minorly think that. robin williams' character gives me goosebumps when he talks. and that doesn't mean he has cheezy lines, its because it just felt like the words coming out of his mouth were real. that he wasn't given a script. he was having a normal conversation<br/><br/>Anyways... thats my favourite part of the movie. but its not the only part. this movie is always interesting. it feels like there is not one point in the movie in which i could go to the bathroom and feel like i missed nothing. and the casting for the main roles is perfect."
"willcundallreview","8","2","5","26 March 2015"," A very good movie with a very good cast
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a movie that gets so many people talking, it is loved by many and the performances too. I felt as I watched just why do so many love it, I didn't think it was perfection but there is no doubt this is an interesting piece of cinema with it's smart plot and emotionally charged characters. I did feel it was very good and although only just about, it still manages to really let you enjoy it.<br/><br/>The first thing to say about this is Robin Williams who is at his very best here. He just feels so excellent as his role as Sean Maguire who as you will see councils Will Hunting and he adds an extra element to this movie Robin does. All the cast are fairly strong here, Matt Damon as Will is good and really shows us what he has got for his future film career. Cast such as Ben Affleck aren't really shown as much as the two I mentioned but him among his brother Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard form a good little cast for this type of film. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon of course write the movie and they do a great job, not only capturing everyday life situations well, but adding in Will Hunting to those scenes to make it feel smart and funny. I did however feel it was slightly contrived, mostly in the way they want to get a certain emotion out of you, sometimes you can laugh and sometimes you can be sad, even times when they want you to think ""Oh wow he's smart that Will Hunting"". I will also add that the script though is really showcasing the talent these two guys have, and I do feel like these guys really are an example to look up to when aspiring screenwriters come up.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant directs it well and his job is made easier by the fine script brought to him. He manages to delicately direct it without making the film feel done before or too much like a typical piece of cinema. Van Sant also could be said to contribute to Williams performance and you can see Gus really worked well with the cast to make them bring the most out of the script. Another delicate thing is the score, now when you making a film about a genius from Boston, Danny Elfman doesn't always spring to mind but he manages to beautifully score it and the music is really one thing I remember the most about watching the movie.<br/><br/>One good thing about the movie is that it is smart, not only in movie terms but in terms of the script and the actors who all seem to remember there lines so well, it almost feels like they all know mathematics like we see in the film. I think all the credit goes to Affleck and Damon who if I'm not mistaken, are not mathematic geniuses but do the screenplay in such a way that it feels like a professor has written parts of the film.<br/><br/>Overall it is the ending that is the real pay off, of course I'm not going to ruin it for you but lets just say it makes you feel emotion and really draws you close to the characters we see so much of in this movie. Overall this is totally worth a watch, not only for people thinking ""It's Oscar nominated, it must be good"", but also people who just want an interesting film, not for those who want action or true thrills but it is definitely one for the thinkers and maybe even the unidentified genius."

","If you are just an average movie fan, then you probably know Matt Damon mainly (if not entirely) from his portrayal of Jason Bourne in the original Bourne trilogy. Do not expect to see him drown to many people in sinks in this movie, but expect to be blown away by his performance none-the-less.<br/><br/>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a janitor in one of the most prestigious colleges in the world. A math professor of a high level course challenges his students to complete a very difficult equation, which he later admits took him ages to complete. The professor writes the problem on a chalk board in the hallway, and when everyone is gone, Will Hunting completes the equation without an issue whatsoever.<br/><br/>The professors of the college are mesmerized and can not figure out who this secret genius is. Finally they track down Hunting and try to convince him that he needs to be using his vast intellect for research and teaching. They tell him how much money he could be making. What they soon learn is that not every wise man wants a life full of riches and Nobel prizes on his mantle. Some men just want to enjoy the simple life.<br/><br/>Hunting has a mysterious past that is causing him to shut people out before they get too close to him, but one man may prove to be smart enough to breakthrough the difficult past of this genius young man. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), your average-everyday psychiatrist, may be more similar to Hunting than either of them initially realize.<br/><br/>This is one of the first drama films that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish without a single murder or explosion thrown in the mix. Scene to scene suspense, this movie will have you wanting to delve into Hunting's past just as much as Maguire.<br/><br/>If you are looking for brilliant acting, and a powerful message about the greed of the American dream: look no further than Good Will Hunting."

","I'm imagining that the people who call this film boring are of the frame of mind, that unless a film has at least three explosions then it's not worth the price of a cinema ticket. Then there are the people calling it unrealistic. Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, 'get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines 'Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' 'Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast. It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream. Let them watch this 'chewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema."

","What can I say about this movie.. It is simple sensational. For a good understanding about the essence of this movie, it needs to be analyzed with an open heart, it is need to be done in a sentimental way not in a robotic one. <br/><br/>The importance of the message within this movie, we can find in our life, the need of someone near us represent's not just a simple need of affiliation to a certain group but a need for a protective ""shield"" that has the meant to protect us from all of our problems and to push us from the heavy part of our life. This movie has managed to perfectly expose the feelings that one person, in this case Will Hunting, has gained from the negative part that has marked his life. We can observe the fact that,life,even if we believe that in the first moments it has to be gentile, to show us the most beautiful thing,love,but life can be harsh with some of us even from the beginning of it and it throws us in a totally different world characterized by ignorance,poverty,fear,violence,etc. The affirmation of Will has another important role in the key of perception and the message is very clear- Just with the opening of our souls,with true friendship and love we can outrun the most difficult obstacles that has been attributed to us. The true friendship helps us to go further in life, it pushes you, it awakens you from the endless nightmare that life has taken you.<br/><br/>In the end i would like to appreciate the fabulous work of Robin Williams that was sensational in speech,action,gestures he is truly an ace that was played in this great movie!."

","A movie with great actors, yet an even greater message.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's performance in the movie was excellent, loved his character, Will Hunting was a very unusual guy, gifted with a great mind and memory, but dangerously reckless.<br/><br/>The message this movie had is still relevant to this day. Anyone can easily screw up their life by simply not knowing what they really want. Usually, you have to make the decision of what you are going to be, early in your life, you are 16 - 20 years old, many people fail to find their way and end up disappointed and unhappy for the rest of their lives. That was the case with Will as well, he didn't really care about his insane math skills and hanged out with complete idiots.<br/><br/>Some people need to have someone show them the way, because on many occasions there are very talented people, who are just wasting time on useless studies/things that they don't need or it is just too easy for them.<br/><br/>Not to say, you should do whatever someone else tells you to do, but in Will's case he needed some sort of guidance."

"powermandan","10","2","5","20 November 2014"," One of the Best and Most Therapeutic Movies Ever Made.
","1997 was a very difficult year for movies. There was Titanic (that took almost every award), Good Will Hunting, LA Confidential, Boogie Nights, Air Force One, Cop Land, Austin Powers and loads of others. Good Will Hunting was one of the movies that year that continues to mesmerize and inspire everybody that sees it. Sad thing is, the movie was nominated for many awards, but won every little against Titanic. Titanic won almost every award because it had more things to offer. Titanic had the song, score, sets, acting, originality, suspense, among others that were either at par with, or better than other movies of that year. Good Will Hunting was not a great piece of ""film."" There was no (or very little) elements of camera tricks, deep focus, symbolism etc. All it had was a great story and a great script, those were all it needed. Good Will Hunting had the best script of the year and one of the best scripts ever. If a movie has witty dialogue, as this does, it deserves a pat on the back. If a movie contains dialogue that sears the heart and drives your emotions, it deserves a major award. <br/><br/>Will Hunting (Damon) is a janitor at MIT that solves extremely complicated equations in an instant that most professors take years to prove. After Will gets in trouble with law for the umpteenth time, one of the professors interested in him (Skarsgaard) sets him up with a psychology professor at a community college (Williams) to council him. As a child, Will was abused and abandoned by his parents, so he pushes away anything that gets close to him because he is afraid of being hurt again. Will is lost and scared and it is up to Sean Maguire, who understands him completely to make Will realize how precious his gift is. Both Will and Sean's lives will be changed forever. <br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a movie about searching the human soul for who you are. The therapy scenes, actually almost the whole movie is enough to completely take a toll on the viewer and inspire them and give hope. The acting is top notch by all, especially by Damon and Williams. I think this is Williams' best movie, not because he won the Oscar for it, but because it was one of the few serious roles he did the can change people's lives. We have Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams and the rest of the cast to thank for this life-changing movie."

This film from the beginning gripped my full attention. It's as if the three stars referenced above really weren't actors in the film. It was real life. No one would be noticed if they tried to redo this film. Life today is very hard, and scenes as depicted here are probably common. Every one in a while it's a good thing to try to convey to the public that we're all alike and from time to time show a glimpse of the extraordinary in their lives, but can't seem to get their message out. Here, Matt Damon, is an example of someone like this. He's fortunate to receive the help he needs. It's not easy, as the film shows, but Robil Williams is the one (that everyone of us needs) who finally breaks thru to truly help someone who is Good, Will Hunting."

","GOOD WILL HUNTING, even though there really aren't any narrative surprises, is filled with wonderful dialogue and bolstered by strong performances.

Together with the help of an MIT professor (Stellan Skarsgard) and a psychologist (Robin Williams) he comes to understand his true potential. The best parts of the film are the many dialogue scenes, some emotionally deep and others biting, that add so much depth to the characters. This was a passion project for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and it shows. The dialogue felt natural and true to life, which adds to the authenticity of the overall experience. Though everyone (including Ben Affleck) turns in an excellent performance, Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good. Matt Damon is the hard-headed young adult who is afraid to let people in, and Robin Williams is a professor with experience and insight that he uses to get to Will. Even though the narrative structure wasn't the tightest, there was something to enjoy about every scene, and all of them added something to the overall picture. I should also mention that Minnie Driver does a great job as Will's girlfriend, and Casey Affleck has a few of the best lines. As far as other aspects go I enjoyed the score, which was never intrusive or told the audience how to feel. There was also a rather eclectic soundtrack which fit the moods of various scenes perfectly. Overall, it was a superbly written film with equally good performances."

A masterpiece that's made possible by a good, simple, honest script, a bunch of high quality new faces and vintage actors, and a drive to tell meaningful story of real people.<br/><br/>I watched this a second time recently, and picked up even more nuances that I missed years ago. Robin Williams played his 'therapist with unresolved past' part so perfectly. Great synergy between the young Damon and Williams.<br/><br/>The under-estimated Minnie Drivers also made a supporting appearance here. Good chemistry between the love birds. Unforced, un-self-conscious naturalistic acting from actresses is so rare, a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Evident in this movie, Ben Affleck is a genuinely modest human being who is really not conceited about his natural good looks or brain.

Now, I am angry with myself and upset because one of my scripts was rejected by my director (rather he said politely, let's make this one later) . So I had to get back to this spirit lifting film and again it made me rise from the pitfall and made me stand erect. <br/><br/>This is a kinda of film that is rare, it's about friendship one can say, it's about knowing oneself someone else may say, but it's great anyway you look at it.The simplest question ""What do you want to do?"" is the toughest one to answer. At times, we need someone to help us along with that question.Here Will is helped by Sean. <br/><br/>The movie works for it's writing and acting by all. Moreover, the way it is directed, makes it completely authentic and believable Will Hunting (Matt Damon) does not exist in many, there are a few and yet he can be related to, we all have talents but we need direction.We need someone to say.

Look at the scene at the end where the car just goes away and keeps going away, tells us that this movie is something else from the commercial rot. This has got great dialog to match it up with and well, the cinematography is commendable. <br/><br/>Well, acting by Robin Williams is worth a mention, because he did take the whole role to a new level. Just take that ""Fart Scene"" where he confesses his wife used Fart is something that can make anyone into splits with a subdued amount of tears because there is tragedy involved.Also, I can relate Sean to my good brother ""Vinay Anna"" whom I have met over a year and made a great bond with. He is a man, who used to tell me ""Just do, what you want to do, we will for sure back you up"" His words, made me pursue what I believe in, and I am still doing it. <br/><br/>I have no crib whatsoever with any technical department be it art direction, production design, music, editing or even costumes. They are simply great as they are very apt for this movie. All the 5 thumbs up for this 5/5 movie.

","A youthful, but unhinged genius Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at the MIT, where he conspicuously solves higher level mathematical conundrum handed out to students by Fields Medal-winning combinatorialist Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd). Shocked by the ingenuity of the troubled orphan Lambeau ventures to have him enrol as his student. The South Boston bred man-child however prefers to spend time and money on booze by the gallons with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). Following a aggressive assault by Hunting on a man who bullied him as a child, Will agrees to attend therapeutic sessions and become Lambeau's prot√©g√©. After several therapist resign from taking on the troublesome genius, Lambeau finally asks his former roommate Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to take on the formidable task. Despite a soul-breaking first encounter, Maguire decides on the challenge, despite the necessity of overcoming Hunting's intellectually layered self-defence mechanisms...<br/><br/>Back in the days ""Good Will Hunting"" offered a novelty perspective, one heavily layered in witty dialogue, well versed psychoanalysis and somehow avoiding pointless on-screen blabbering. A brain-child of youthful Affeck and Damon came a brilliant piece of drama, strongly carried on the shoulders of the central theme of the therapeutic sessions. Probably Gus van Sant's most mainstream effort is arguably also his most honest and best. Unskewed by pretence the story sells as a traditionally structured drama, but with such an intensely successful script, which makes it an undying classic. Although several scenes do seem rough, especially those centred around Skarsg√•rd and the wasting away of Will's talent, almost misguided in intent and somewhat hollow, nowhere close to as forceful as the key sessions between Maguire and Hunting. Exposition is pretty low key and apart from lone scenes like Hunting's love interest, Skylar (Minnie Driver) flying away to California shuns away from artistic endeavours, keeping a simple and focused outlook on the key issues at hand - the question of fulfilment as defined by intellectual achievements as opposed to that of bliss happiness caused by human interaction."

","Matt Damon was great. There's no doubt about that. His performance as Will Hunting - a genius who just doesn't fit into society and ends up as a janitor at MIT instead of a student - was fabulous, and made the movie worth watching. Unfortunately I personally didn't think there was much else fabulous about this. The story was modestly interesting, and the viewer certainly does want to know what eventually happens to Will. The ending was, strangely, both appropriately and unfortunately ambiguous, as Will leaves behind an opportunity to ""make it"" in order to pursue love. I say ""appropriately"" because the lack of resolution seemed to fit with the rest of his life, and ""unfortunately"" because it left me with no clear knowledge of what happened to him. The movie also raises valid questions about what it means to ""fit in."" Will didn't, because he wasn't doing what everyone thought he should do with his life, but - on the other hand - maybe that was just Will. Do we have to fit into a preconceived notion of what we should be doing? Fair question.<br/><br/>So, there was a lot of good stuff in the actual story. Now, I know this is a minority opinion, but I wasn't take with the rest of the cast: Steven Skarsgard as the professor who discovers Will and tries to mold him, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend from South Boston (who co-wrote the movie with Damon), Minnie Driver as Skylar - Will's burgeoning love interest, and Robin Wiliams as the counsellor who helps Will confront some of his past demons. None of them were bad, but they also didn't really grab hold of me. Frankly, I also found the movie dragged dreadfully at times and at a little over two hours was a bit too long as a result.

","Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a young man from Boston who is brilliant, but also a troublemaker. He has a gift, something that he could use to get out of the down-trodden life he lives, but he's afraid, of his gift, and of leaving what he knows. But when as part of his probation for assaulting a police officer, he is released into the care of an M.I.T. professor, he has to face his fears face on. This is done with his psychologist, played by Robin Williams. For me, the movie came alive when Williams showed up. Up until that point, it was well done, but basic. Williams has the ability in his movies to either totally take control of a scene, or to sit back and play off the other actors (I can't wait for Insomnia.)  I know he's generally seen as a comedic actor, but he's one of the few that can also pull of a serious role (again, I can't wait for Insomnia.)  After he meets Will, he sort of meets his match. After losing his wife to cancer, he went into his own shell, staying with what he knew, what was safe. But while he teaches Will to meet his fears head on, Will also teaches him a few things.<br/><br/>
Once again, the plot is somewhat predictable. When Williams' character says early on that he skipped Game 6 of the World Series because he had to see about a woman, you knew that line would come back later on, and it did. The thing that makes this movie worthwhile, was the performance of Williams. I know everyone is talking about Matt Damon being the next big thing, and the script he and friend and co-star Ben Affleck wrote, is strong. But the person that carries the film, in my mind, is Robin Williams. And having Minnie Driver in the movie doesn't hurt (my bias for beautiful women comes through again). So even though you can guess what's going to happen next, the dialogue between the characters (and they all do a good job of holding on the Boston accent the entire film), and the superior acting carry the movie a long way. Not a yawner, not movie of the year, but fun to watch."

The only movies that can get away with such tortured pop psychology were all made by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>I liked Minnie Driver and Ben Affleck, accent or no (it's hard to tell), and Robin Williams was OK. Matt Damon's character is so depressingly obvious that it's difficult to sit through his journey to self-awareness, and the epiphany scene is just embarrassing.<br/><br/>But I can't say enough about Gus Van Sant and his deceptively transparent direction. Somehow he makes the flat script come alive with just a few touches. Notice how he uses the stationary and panning shots - and how he frames each image to make it vital. This is especially true for the scenes with Driver. I'm not a Van Sant fan, but I think he really lifted this movie up by its wet corners and tried his best to give it life."

"Susie-3","Null","2","5","31 May 1999"," Hunting is a believable character
","I did not think this movie was great, but I did like it.  However, I do not feel the characters in this movie are unrealistic, as some have complained. I felt the character of Will Hunting, who seems to be the most maligned, was very real.  Maybe the problem is that people have gotten so used to seeing characters who are one-dimensional and non-contradictory, even though this is not what people are like in real life.  Will Hunting is a mathematical genius, but this in no way means that he should behave intelligently in all domains of his life.  Hence, it is not unrealistic for him to behave stupidly when it comes to women.  Nor is it unrealistic for him to work as a janitor.  In my experience, people often do things that could not be predicted from their intelligence or abilities alone.  I myself have done things that I intellectually knew were stupid or detrimental; I'm sure most people have, and a mathematical genius should be no exception.  The character of Hunting struck me very much as a guy who has a problem with sabotaging his own happiness and success, maybe out of fear of greater failure should he put himself on the line.  His amazing abilities do not necessitate that he have a good job and a university degree, because it is not just intelligence that determines these things.  In school, perhaps he skipped all his classes and never did his assignments, and thus got poor grades.  That being the case, he would not have been accepted to a prestigious university, and in fact no one might have noticed his affinity for math.  It is also possible he simply didn't apply to university, even though he might have been accepted, either to stay with his friends or to prevent academic failure.  I think one of the points of this movie is that being gifted does not by itself make you happy and successful.  Being gifted does not make you immune to psychological problems, or make you behave in an intelligent manner in all situations.  If his character had been written this way- well, first off, there wouldn't be a movie.  Secondly, that would have made his character completely unbelievable.  I do concede that the likelihood of a genius being a janitor is not that great, but it is not impossible, and I'm sure it happens.  There are historical figures that we now recognise as great, even though in their time they were ignored or ridiculed for their beliefs.  There are also nutty geniuses, who cut off their ears and what not.  In light of such things and of my own personal experiences, I don't see any reason why Hunting can't be as screwed up as the rest of us."

As Will's problems with the police escalate, Lambeau offers an out, but with two conditions namely: visits to a therapist and weekly math sessions. Will agrees to the latter but refuses to cooperate with a succession of therapists. Lambeau then contacts his former classmate, therapist Sean McGuire, an instructor at Bunker Hill Community College. Both are equally stubborn, but Will is finally forced to deal with both his past and his future.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films in the 1990's that is both sincere and heartwarming especially when it presents the moving story of brilliant but troubled youth like Will Hunting.Also,the viewer gets to realize that beneath his arrogance and crass behavior, you'll find a lot of hurt and many defense mechanisms raised against a non-compassionate and manipulative society.Overall,it allows us to understand about Will Hunting's humanity rather than his gifts.<br/><br/>The film was acted and directed extremely well.Damon and Williams were superb in their performance as Will Hunting and the psychiatrist respectively.Aside from that,the movie also gives the viewer a positive and inspirational experience especially if we get to understand what is beneath the character's persona.Overall,this is one excellent film that is emotionally rich and entertaining."

","On any given day, I probably would have spent my evening reading, or playing video games, or watching TV. Today, however, I decided to log onto Netflix and see what was available to ""Watch Instantly."" I looked under the ""Recommended for You"" section and saw the title of a film I had only ever heard of. I had never bothered to ask anyone what it was about; my parents had told me a while ago that it was a great movie, but naturally I hadn't listened (after all, it was rated R). I couldn't even make out the actors on the tiny image of the DVD box. All I recognized was the title: Good Will Hunting. I was done with my homework, I didn't have anything constructive to do, and I was bored, so I clicked on the link that read, ""Play Movie"". I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>This film, written by two former Harvard students and great friends, is by far one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. From the opening kaleidoscopic views of physics equations to the final shot of a junky car heading west on the highway, I was intrigued, to say the least. To anyone who hasn't seen it, you don't realize the sheer beauty of these simple camera shots. To anyone who has, you know exactly what I mean. The story follows Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor working at MIT who is far smarter than the mathematics professors teaching there. It is later revealed that he had a tough childhood, is an orphan, and never had a chance to go to a school like MIT, but by proving an incredibly difficult theorem he shows Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) that he has an amazing gift for mathematics. One thing leads to another, and the only way Will can stay out of jail for assault charges is if he gets therapy from Professor Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a teacher at a community college. Through this therapy, Will comes to realize that he has too much potential to throw away his life living in South Boston. This story runs parallel to Will's love life with Skylar (Minnie Driver), a student at Harvard University. This relationship could have ended up as a pointless plot addition to make the movie longer, but it actually becomes pretty vital to the plot of the movie and completely changes Will's life. The combination of a love story and the story of a genius who finally realizes his full potential makes a brilliant film.<br/><br/>This film's story is amazing, but a great film doesn't only have a good story. A great film has a great story, great acting, great scenery, great music, and great symbolism. Good Will Hunting has all of these aspects, and more. The fact that this movie was written by two amateur filmmakers only emphasizes their movie-making skill, and the fact that they can actually act is what fuses the incredible plot to the rest of the movie. If anyone else had been cast as the lead roles of Will Hunting and Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), the movie probably wouldn't have captured all the aspects that make up this great film. It is a very good thing Matt Damon and Ben Affleck adopted these roles, but the inclusion of Robin Williams in this film takes it up a level. Williams' ability to perfectly transition from jokes to concern to even violence is a blatant sign that he is a great actor, and without him this film could not have succeeded. Aside from the obvious acting and plot aspects of the movie, Good Will Hunting is also stunningly symbolic. Whether Damon and Affleck meant to add so many symbols to the film or not, they did so seamlessly. I won't add any plot spoilers, but let me tell you: if you can recognize the true meaning in films, you will devour this movie.<br/><br/>I am grateful to Netflix, to say the least. I don't know what their policy is on making movies available to watch online, but I do know that this policy is definitely a good one. On any given day, I wouldn't have watched the brilliant film that is Good Will Hunting. I'm glad today wasn't any given day. 10/10"

","According to legendary film-writer William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Princess Bride), it was he who changed Affleck and Damon's treatment from something altogether more conventional into the Oscar-winning screenplay filmed by Gus Van Sant. Whoever is responsible, we should simply be glad the film was made, as it's a very well realised, emotionally satisfying, mostly original drama; from the moving performances, especially from Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, to Van Sant's camera, forever searching for the soul of the scene, this is clearly confident, intelligent film-making.<br/><br/>For all its truths, the film is fantastical: under Danny Elfman's twinkling, otherworldly score, there isn't a single shot of Will (Damon) actually reading one of the books he knows by heart. Indeed, we're never quite clear where Will finds the time to feed his dizzying intellect between working, fighting and drinking. Less forgivable is that Driver's Skylar is rather unfairly banished from the third act, reducing a bright character to a dull device to provide a neat ending.<br/><br/>For my money, in terms of Van Sant's 'crowd-pleasing' output, Good Will Hunting doesn't quite scale the heights of the more acerbic To Die For, or the more politically substantial Milk. But thought-provoking and very nicely played nonetheless."

","Sometimes watching a movie with no idea of it whatsoever and hence having no particular expectations from it can be so generously rewarding.

Instead of breaking my head in figuring out the best way to describe what the movie (which is now in my all-time favorite movie list)is about, I will tell you what it's not. It's not a pretentious movie that tells the story of some shallow people. It's not a movie which though has a great story but goes nowhere. It's not a drama which will make you cry every other scene. It's an honest movie which has got an amazing script that is portrayed beautifully by equally amazing actors. In fact there is a sense of honesty in every character you see in the movie, the lines they speak and even their attitude throughout... and that is the charm of it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's screenplay is way too good which got them a deserving Oscar. Robin William gives a spellbinding performance and is the one to watch out for.<br/><br/>In all sincerity if you could just connect to this movie the way I did, maybe you and I are not so different after all.

","Let me start with the profanity: it is SO true to Boston, particularly South Boston (known as ""Southie"").

The accents (even Robin Williams') rang true to this ex-Bostonian, and the dialogue was spot on. The script was perfect. And the performances were uniformly top-notch: Robin Williams was so believable as the educated psychiatrist who still hadn't left behind his Southie roots. He's never been better, before or since, which is a credit to Gus Van Sant.<br/><br/>I've been to MIT and Harvard, I've been to Southie, and I've lived in Boston.

","Good Will Hunting is fantastic! A story written by Matt Damon and Ben Afleck which is a little mastermind that leaves you with a large smile at the end, after the emotional roller-coaster throughout. Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a mathematical genius and has potential that only one wishes to have, however there is real personal issues that has affected Will, stopping his own potential to be full-filled because of his life experiences growing up as a child. In more specific terms Will is like a terrified child who stays at home on his couch, so he doesn't have to go into the real world and feel the kind of hurt that has affected him before in life. Will hangs around with so called ""no brainers"" and his best friend Chuckie (Played by Ben Afleck) who is the type that really would lie in the middle of the road for Will we gradually begin to admire this genuine loyal friendship that in the middle class world seems to be rare for some people. Great sub-plot with therapist Sean Maguire (played by Robin Williams) which is like cat and mouse with each meetings they have. Will has always called the shots and kept in control of what he wants people to no and understand about him, but Sean is finally his match, and with great dialogue this kept me locked and fascinated throughout the film as i generally wanted to no more about Will and understand him! There is love in Will's life called Skylar (played by Minne Driver) and Skylar has everything charisma, looks, intelligence and a very sweet/caring side. Will struggles throughout being able to allow himself to love Skylar and become vulnerable for a women once in his life. Good Will hunting is a film that educates and provokes human ignorance for roughly 2 hours and definitely changes people perceptions of judging people who they truly don't understand!"

","Good Will Hunting weaves many themes: love, friendship, loyalty, rivalry, class, relationships and intelligence. Considering that this film was also written by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck makes it even more remarkable. What started as a collection of scenes became this modern fable for generation X. Folks might be put off by the language, but it is what makes the film real. Having been in Boston, I have seen the differences between Southies and the upper crust, and Matt & Ben, who I believe are from Boston, really bring this class issue to light. You also see unconditional love & loyalty in the friendship of Matt & Ben (which parallels the Stellan Skarsgard/Robin Williams friendship), and later, in the relationship of therapist Robin Williams with Matt. Matt's lack of vulnerability is his shield in relationships until he meets the premed student as played by Minnie Driver. With her, his walls come down, but he is still wary of exposing his vulnerability and has a fear of commitment. And it is the therapist (Robin Williams) who finally breaks through, teaching Matt about revealing himself. There are many poignant moments in this film; and given the fact that Ben Affleck has been slammed many times for his acting, he gives a sublime, endearing facet to his character's friendship with Matt in his performance. Minnie Driver projects a warmth and intelligence that Matt's character is attracted to. She is an open book, unafraid of falling in love with Will Hunting, and sad when she cannot feel the reciprocation from him. But the real scene stealer is Robin Williams, whose therapist character is similar to Will; southie boy who is wicked smart. The scenes of Matt and Robin are like a well choreographed dance, and I believe that this is some of Robin's best dramatic work since Peter Weir's Dead Poet's Society. Having watched this movie many times, I keep finding new subtleties in all the acting performances. Definitely a must see film!"

","If you've seen the movie Paycheck, you would not assume that Ben Affleck has brilliant writing talent in him. He apparently does and, along with childhood pal Matt Damon, in Good Will Hunting, he has penned a nearly perfect script. Good Will Hunting will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you angry and sad and happy and excited all at once. It makes you root for its protagonist one moment and then hate him for being so stubborn the next. In short, it is one of the most powerful screenplays ever written.<br/><br/>Besides the writing, it is also perfectly acted. Ben Affleck is fantastic as Will Hunting's best friend and deserved an Oscar nomination simply for the scene in which he tells Will that he wishes Will would one day simply not be at his house. While Affleck is great in a relatively small role, however, it is Damon and Robin Williams who steal the show as the titular character and his psychologist, respectively. Damon's Will Hunting is just about the smartest man in the world, a man who can solve the most difficult calculus problem in his head and can read a book in a matter of minutes. Despite his genius, he is deeply emotionally troubled, due to his upbringing on the rough streets of Boston. Williams won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the only man who was able to get under Will's skin.<br/><br/>The movie, as stated above, makes you feel a wide span of emotions. Will is such a complex character that we cannot ever fully understand what makes him tick. Sometimes, we feel like he is growing emotionally, and sometimes we just can't grasp why he is being so stubborn and immature. The movie flows beautifully from one scene to the next and only seems to get better as it progresses. Also, it stands up wonderfully upon multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997 but only came away with two wins, Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor and Damon and Affleck for Best Original Screenplay. I have seen all five films nominated for Best Picture that year, and this film is far and away the best of them. Titanic is a very good movie and certainly groundbreaking in terms of visual effects, but it comes nowhere close to making the emotional impact that this film makes. Also, Matt Damon was absolutely robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor by Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets).<br/><br/>Simply put, Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990's and one of my personal favorites of all time. I have handed out only 20 ratings of perfect 10's on IMDb out of over 600 films that I've rated. Good Will Hunting earned this coveted rating by combining a phenomenal screenplay with superb direction and impeccable acting. This film is truly one not to miss."

The sub-plot involving two academic rivals ‚Äì Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard ‚Äì is about the struggle between two strong personalities to decide the best way to help Will.<br/><br/>Will suffers from a background of being shuffled from one foster home to another and this leads to behavior that regularly lands him in trouble.

Lambeau sees potential waiting to be unleashed and Maguire sees the wounded human soul, who needs to be rescued before he releases him into the world.<br/><br/>Will finds love in a young university woman named Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, who clearly sees the broken man with a big heart, who is a latent genius. Skylar is a natural with Will and his friends, despite the fact that they exist in different worlds. When Skylar decides to pursue her dreams in California, she asks Will to go with her. She loves him deeply but because of a deep-seated fear he might be hurt or betrayed, Will cannot bear to leave the world he knows with the friends he trusts. His friends are Chuck Sullivan, (Ben Affleck) Morgan O'Mally, (brother Casey Affleck) and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser).<br/><br/>Will's fate is more or less decided at a critical moment in the movie with his therapist and is reinforced by his girlfriend Skylar and his friend Chuckie ‚Äì both believe in him and care deeply for him. This movie is the result of collaboration between Damon and Affleck. They wrote and produced the movie, drawing on their Boston roots to show the hardscrabble existence of the blue-collar Irish in South Boston (Southie) with poverty and street fighting. The movie is directed by Gus Van Sant, who directed the movie Elephant. The foul language is somewhat jarring but serves to make the movie an accurate portrayal.<br/><br/>This movie shows the gap between the blue-collar workers and the university people in the same city but in that setting two strong-willed men try to help a young man from the wrong side of town."

He was lacking the guiding principles in his life.<br/><br/>Robin Williams, the psychologist, argued that only being a genius is not enough to make a person successful and happy, and he gave Unabomber as an example, who was a mathematical genius.<br/><br/>The psychologist helped Matt (with a bit of forcing) to get rid of all the layers of pretentiousness, arrogance, and the masks he wear and finally touch where it hurts deep inside. Matt had to feel his hurt, realize the absence of his guiding principles, or whatever you want to call ""not even knowing what he wants out of life"", before he can start the healing process.<br/><br/>When we make choices in life, our decisions are partially influenced by what we have learned while growing up. We learn the right from wrong mainly from our parents. In the absence of parents, teachers, relatives, the community or the religion provide us the guidance we need. Having been an orphan, and not having had a stable foster family, Matt didn't have a solid upbringing.

","The film works because it manages to capture various shades of each character in an unforced manner through an intelligent script.Though the impossibility of the scenario depicted may make one apprehensive in the beginning,it is precisely that which allows the cast the unique opportunity to lend credibility to the film's script by their remarkably honest performances complemented by crackling dialogue which ranges from the witty,to the profound,to the meaningfully terse without being overly emphatic at any time.There are many things which have been handled with admirable sensitivity like the bond of friendship between the boys,how the healer(Sean)manages to reach out to Will who in turn makes an impact on him,the refreshing chemistry between Will and Skylar,how prof.Lambeau's personal fears,Will's troubled past and his vulnerability are brought out.Yet for all it's finer nuances,the story is told in such a simple and lucid manner that it holds one's attention even if one refuses to probe into them.I can go on and on about this layered film but i'd rather not because i would like the reader to watch this engaging film speak it's own language himself(or herself)and gather the joys of discovering it's subtleties."

","Will Hunting is part of the elite of the intellectual class: a true genius. He's one of those people who can go from step A to step C without even having to bother with step B. Unfortunately for Will, he's also just a janitor. Not having had the privilege of the right education, he struggles to get by in life, even with his intellectual potential. Growing up as an orphan and raised in the lower class neighborhood, he has a lot of issues which cause him to have a violent and rebellious nature. The story of 'Good Will Hunting' begins when Will is discovered by a prestigious Math Professor at the Harvard University. He promises to work with Will if he in turn goes to see a psychiatrist every week to help him with his problems. We see how everyone deals with the changes in Will's life and how this affects Will himself. Will he be a blatant success? Or will his rebellious nature and his internal struggle keep him from reaching his potential?<br/><br/>This is pretty much the main storyline. What makes GWH so good is that there are also a lot of smaller plot lines that are almost as interesting to follow. They are well written and never feel like filler (they do in a lot of other movies). What everyone probably knows is that this film was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck themselves. I always found it odd that two people who are (I assume) unexperienced writers can come up with such a wonderful, fresh and well constructed script. When there are so many full-time writers out there who are not able to produce a decent script. Anyway, Matt and Ben got the Oscar for the script and they deserved it too. It's one of my favorite scripts of the nineties and that was a great decade for movies.<br/><br/>Now enough about the script. How about the performances, you say. Well, they are great. Robin Williams gives (maybe) his best performance ever and Matt Damon is also very memorable. I still think his performances in The Talented Mr. Ripley was better, but this is a close second. Minnie Driver was also good, as she usually is. Ben Affleck and the rest of the cast deliver a decent performances. He has failed to impress me even a single time I'm afraid.<br/><br/>Besides the acting and the script, there were several other things that stood out for me. The music for instance. No big theatrical things but sober and modest. It fitted very well with the overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>As for it's ranking on IMDb. Why is it not in the top 250? It should be. I hope it will soon take his righteous position back.<br/><br/>9.1/10"

The acting is fantastic from every actor involved, I know Ben Affleck gets lots of stick but he's great also, but special praise goes to Matt Damon who portrays the troubled young man to perfection and Robin Williams, who shows what a great actor he can be in the right role, who is the grown up version of Matt Damon who never fully utilized his potential. These are ably supported by the likes of Minnie Driver and Stellen Skarsgard who also put in great supporting roles.<br/><br/>As i said earlier the one thing that stays with you after watching it is the power of the film, this is from the performances and from the story itself.

","As you can tell right away by my score, i think this is an incredible movie. I've only given two 10 scores, but i've no doubt in my mind that this movie deserves it. The film was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and in my opinion, is superior to Titanic. The film itself is one great scene after another, expertly written and acted in such a way that it reminds me of the Godfather films. The way Sean ( brilliantly acted by Robin Williams) was the only one able to break Will's ( an equally brilliant Matt Damon) tough exterior, really drives the film. The scene in the park where Sean tells Will he knows nothing about life, and that "" when i look at you, i don't see a strong, confident young man, i see a cocky, scared s***less kid."" Great moments like these come one after another and reaches an emotional climax with the "" it's not your fault"" scene. Minnie Driver's performance as Skylar nearly stole the show. I fell in love with her quirky charm, making it all the more dramatic when there relationship reaches a head with another great moment in the film. This is film any film lover should see. It's a testament to what can be done when two people come with a great story, memorable characters, and a desire to create an incredible film."

With Gus Van Sant, the envisioner of the movie, and the unsurprisingly superb Danny Elfman behind the musical wheel, Good Will Hunting deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.  Titanic was predictable and true; Good Will Hunting offered a new story to the genre of fantasy screenplays, and it was evident in its winning Best Original Screenplay.

See this movie and follow along with Will on his magical ""hunt"" for a future and security."
"FlickJunkie-2","9","2","6","3 September 2000"," An intelligent story
","This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department.  Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. <br/><br/>
Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT.  This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy.  He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing.  The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale.  <br/><br/>The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for which they won an academy award (the film was nominated for nine).  Both were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse.  Damon was outstanding in the lead.  He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was phenomenal.  Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent.  He was able to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable.  Robin Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best supporting Oscar.<br/><br/>It is hard not to like this film.  Most of the challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting.  I rated this film a 9/10.  We need more scripts like this.  Perhaps if we are lucky, Damon and Affleck will take time from their successful acting careers and collaborate again."

","""Good Will Hunting"" was the feel good movie of 1997, but it was Robin Williams (in an Oscar-winning role) showing his true ability as an actor that made the film work.  The film deals with a troubled young janitor at MIT named Will Hunting (Matt Damon in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a mathematical genius in spite of his minimal education.  ""Good Will Hunting"" is a combination of ""Rocky"" and ""Ordinary People"" in the fact that you pull for the underdog (Matt Damon) and you see how psychologically scarred he is through the man who is acting as his psychiatrist (Robin Williams).  Is ""Good Will Hunting"" a great film?  No, but it's one of those films that you can't help but like due to the elements that are in it.  4.5 out of 5 stars."

It does go on a bit too long, and Minnie Driver's character borders on caricature.  But the rest of the film is amazing.<br/><br/>  Matt Damon sparks life into his already great role.  In a year where young actors did their best to impress, Matt Damon rode out on top (along with Edward Norton).  His performance is full of charm.  Robin Williams won a long-deserved oscar for a great performance, though it doesn't top his best (Mrs. Doubtfire).  The directing by Gus Van Sant is good, but doesn't top his best either (Drugstore Cowboy).<br/><br/>  All in all, a very good film, one that I will see again, but it isn't a classic."

","I am torn between giving this movie a 9 or a 10.  I will not go into how good this movie is, because it has already been said many times.  But it is not quite a ""10"", because of a couple things.  Firstly, Minnie Driver's character seemed really unnecessary.  Why do they have to insert a romance into every movie?  It really ruins the plausibility of the movie - all of the other characters don't suddenly find their ""true loves"", why does the main character always have to?  It really didn't even have much of anything to do with the story.<br/><br/>Also, the idea that you have to go to Harvard or even college to get a good job is highly overrated.  If this kid is such a genius, there are many jobs he could just walk into (and probably be happier doing).  There is a middle ground between being a janitor and a 6 figure salary.<br/><br/>Otherwise it is definitely a must-see flick, almost a 10."
"MovieAlien","Null","2","6","18 March 1999"," The praise about Good Will Hunting does not make sense!
","If I had to summarize this film in a sentence, I'd say that it's an overrated, predictable `self discovery drama set on the East Cost with a bit of romance and the dialogue of a Quentin Tarantino movie.' Surprisingly enough, an affiliate of the big Q himself (Lawrence Bender) co-produced it.<br/><br/>There's nothing to really `give away,' so I'll just say this: If this guy was a `repressed genius,' then why did he wait to show it when he got the job as a janitor? How did this person become a genius in the first place? Why didn't they just send the guy to a mathematician, so his name would  go into the history books next to Galileo and he might know the secret behind the universe? More importantly, why should we care about this person in the first place? Personally, I'd rather see a movie about a street flasher who targets the elderly. That is saying very, very little.<br/><br/>The `self discovery'....`midlife crisis'....'I need to get my life back together' genre has been used so many times it's about as cliched as the standard Hollywood action film. That is the case with `Good Will Hunting,' a movie whose only sole purpose is to keep the halfway intelligent person alert. If you thought this movie was excellent, well, I don't know what else to say, except a recommendation to over 50 other cliched movies that also got an excellent review for no reason.<br/><br/>Robin Williams' performance was increasingly mediocre to have won an Oscar, he did so much much better in `The Fisher King' and `Dead Poets Society.' The screenplay was just OK, and it also did not deserve an Oscar. Who picked Danny Elfman for the musical score? I thought I was listening to Yanni after his orchestra members consumed a box of laxatives. And the love interest with Minnie Driver just did not work. In fact, it ruined the movie. A little trivia for you, Damon and Driver did not get along with each other in real life during filming.<br/><br/>Don't see it if you want something new. I would have spanked myself with a frozen drumstick if this film won a best picture Oscar."

","I have never written a review before. I have rated a great many films and TV series but there was one scene in this film that so profoundly affected me, that I had to comment about it. Now I have watched this film several times since it was made and really enjoyed it, but today 12/30/19, I had to comment on this one particular scene in the movie. The scene is when Will is meeting with the NSA guy, regarding why he should join the clandestine agency. First may I say, how ahead of its time Will's explanation is, as to why he should not join the NSA. It is prior 911 and prior to any current scrutiny of these agencies. Will's response to why he shouldn't join the organization is unbelievably prophetic, considering it was written 22 years ago. His explanation of why he shouldn't, should make every proud citizen struggling to survive, question the current standards and practices of our government agencies including and especially our president's. Will's response explains the actions of the agency and its consequences to the average american citizen. So if you are a reasonable adult, who values morality and is now questioning or possibly doubting our current government agencies, politicians and our presidenct due to questionable tactics and policies, please watch this scene in the movie.

","""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) is an intriguing drama about guilt, life, and love. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This is a movie that revolves a lot around feelings. The protagonist has very complex emotions that has expressed him downward into a negative spiral, and subsequently, the progress and resolution can be very emotionally intense on both sides of the spectrum. Matt Damon's and Robin William's both deliver good performances that makes their shared screen-time both thoughtful and enjoyable.<br/><br/>There are, nevertheless, sides to this that has the potential to subtract from this viewing experience. There is a lot of cursing present as well as crude language, and a lot of sexual references and jokes that can offend sensitive viewers. There is also mentioning of abuse from parents, which can be another sensitive subject for some. Depending on one's attitude toward these flipsides, the movie will come across as either wonderful or a waste of potential - or as a compromise in between.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an annoying 4/10.

The amount of commitment in this film is incredible and it shows a true friendship and loyalty. This film also showed a true friend, who helps you move on and encourages you to do better and stop doing the wrong, when a friend knows you can do better and that is capable to do better. I rate this a 10/10.<br/><br/>In this film Will was always in trouble with the law. Will knew the potential he had, he always chose the streets instead of his future. He was scared to move on, he wanted to fit in with his friends instead of getting a good career. What I liked the most about Will is his loyalty to his friends. Will never wanted to move on because he only knew the street life and his friends. Will took is knowledge has a joke when he got in trouble with the law. I respected that from Will, it wasn't good to joke around about it. But the law didn't expect that from someone that got in trouble with the law all the time.<br/><br/>Will found true love, a girl named Skylar. Will is scared to commit to a relationship, he thinks that everyone will leave him at the end of the day. This is something many people can relate too. Will went through therapy but he knew he didn't need it, he was taking therapy as a joke. He went through a lot to change and become better. Will was ready to change and take the job, but he left to see about a girl in california. The ending wasn't the best but it ended in him finding true love.

"madelinegpierce","9","1","2","3 June 2019"," Good Will Hunting
","Matt Damon portrays Will Hunting in the heartfelt movie Good Will Hunting (1997). Will (Matt Damon) works as a custodian at MIT. He secretly observes each class and the material that is taught. When the professor puts certain theorems on the blackboard that seem unsolvable, Will (Matt Damon) goes after hours to solve them. All the professors are baffled by the fact that he can solve the theorems. Although, problems start when Will (Matt Damon) gets into an altercation with a police officer and resists arrest. But to his luck, Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd) decides to pay his bail under two conditions. One, that he studies advanced mathematics with him. Two, that he receives therapy from another professor at the school.
Throughout the film, we see how Will faces many personal struggles. Such as, starting and ending a relationship with another woman, interviewing for different jobs, and dealing with issues from his early adolescence in his therapy sessions. This films shows the theme of happiness and how it is achieved despite personal struggles depicted by all of the character in some way, shape, or form.
Some strengths that we see in the film are the cast selections and the character development. The cast selection includes two very well known actors: Robin Williams and Matt Damon. Matt Damon is known for playing characters who often have a rough exterior but a good heart. Robin Williams is known for playing humorous characters who are very lovable but can be serious when the need be.
The acting talent is also present in this film. We see many fight scenes with Will (Matt Damon) which tells us a lot about his character but we also see him develop from that as well. We also see his girlfriend, Skylar (Minnie Driver) at the time in pain and sobbing because of Will (Matt Damon) which creates a sense of empathy for her character.
Another aspect of the film that is worth noting is the script and the language that it contains. The script contains a lot of curse words which can be intense for the viewers at times but it is necessary to characterize the era and the environment of the movie.
The music in this film was fitting for the events that were happening. There was often light music to set the scene in the beginning. Also there was calming music in between each scene which made for a smooth transition.
The lighting played an essential part of the film as well. The use of shadows and more obscure lighting was the most frequent in this film. A specific example would be when Will and the professor are in the interrogation room of the jail and since the scene is very intense, the lighting makes both of their facial features more piercing.
The setting of the movie shows Will's house that he lives in. We see that it is very run down and that he lives in a lower class neighborhood. This automatically shows where Will comes from and gives us empathy for him because of his humble beginnings. Then, it shows him when he arrives to the prestigious college of MIT and that is the exact opposite. We also see that he spends most of his time outside of work at the bar in the same neighborhood that he lives in.
The costume and makeup shows us the styles of the time period that this movie was filmed in. But most importantly, it shows a distinction between social classes. We see the difference between social classes when the professors and students at MIT are shown. We see when Will (Matt Damon) goes in for a job interview and he is not dressed to the standards of the employer.
Finally, there were two scenes that were extremely important to the film and they are very much worth analyzing. One, Will's (Matt Damon) very first therapy session with Sean (Robin Williams). We see that even though he is so intelligent and he seems invincible, he still has his troubled childhood and personal struggles that play a part into the way he is. As viewers, we hope to see how his character development plays out from there.
Another scene that is important is when Sean (Robin Williams) talks about how his wife has passed and how she made him so incredibly happy. We see the theme of happiness appear here and we see Will (Matt Damon) express a desire to obtain that same happiness.
Overall, this compelling film was heartfelt and each character was developed with a touch of humanity. We see how personal struggles and happiness fit hand and hand with each other. I truly recommend watching this film."

","This movie is quite simply amazing. It has a plot that might be known to some: a troubled kid with a lot of potencial, but this movie touches so many important aspects, and does it so well... First of all, it is an absolute delight to see the relationship between Will and Sean develop, it is amazingly well done, totally believable, real... Second of all, the relationship between Will and Skyla: this is one of the best movies in what comes to demonstrating what it is like to be really in love (that initial part when you are absolutely crazy about each other), it happens just like that... Third of all, all the question around what makes a life valuable: an honored job? To be happy? Who's to say? This is what the movie is all about and it develops this question fantastically, with many side stories to it, such as the relationship between Will and his friends and the relationship between the professor and Sean, as well as Will's own life story, which also is very well aborded throughout the movie: a very difficult character to deal with, and they did it brilliantly. Matt Damon was superb, acting as well as writing, Robin Williams was somehow even better, and Ben Affleck made an amazing secundary impact in a hard part. The directors were very well, capturing quite well the love scenes and Will's face towards Skyla, as well as the everlasting tension between Sean and the professor. All, all, all, all so very good. 10/10 because I can't give more. One of the all time greatest movies."

","Good will hunting played by actor Matt Damon is a young man who works as a janitor staying with his ""brother"" actually best friend. One day while at the university he solves a puzzle left on a board by a math professor and he solved it. This starts showing how smart he is without actually even going to college. His best friend chuckie says ""You know what the best part of my day is? For about 10 seconds from when I pull up to the curb to when I get there to your door, 'cause I think maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there"" he says this to Will because he just throws this talent this gift that's been gifted to him but just chooses to work construction or crappy jobs when he could be doing better. I've watched the movie on my own free time and with my english class. After have seeing the movie more than once you see it from a different perspective in many ways people could feel like Will. He's broke, working a crap job, barely getting by like many of us what is different between us and him is his intelligence the way he can fire up different parts of his brain and the way his brain analyzes the problem the complexity of it all. Will can look at any equation and his mind makes it possible to where it makes sense to him. Scientists say normal average beings use only 10% of their brains while people smarter and more fortunate like Steve hawking, or in this case Will hunting.
The writing is witty yet brilliant for a movie that's come out in 1997 it would seem by the way it was portrayed that it would've and could've been a movie that came out easily in 2007. Good Will Hunting was very hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt the actor playing Will says ""You wasted $150,000 on an education you coulda got for $1.50 in late fees at the public library."" which became one of his most famous quotes. Letting everyone know not everyone has to go to college to be smart or successful that it's okay not to have all the money in the world as long as you have yourself and you're mind.<br/><br/>I would easily give the movie a 10 out of 10 stars and more if possible. The overall point of what makes the movie so great is the way it is built the way it's composed as one the way it all pieces together little by little to form such a master of work. I myself am not the type of person to rewatch things I can't stand knowing what happens so I don't like to rewatch things but a movie like this whether watched once or a hundred times its perspective it shows is just something you wouldn't wanna miss and that is why I rate this movie 10 out or 10."
"alcarvalho-87353","10","1","2","30 May 2019"," From Bottom to Top
","I see a movie with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and I tend to drift away from it but this film was different. Matt and Ben tend to be dry, boring actors and never tend to be in very interesting films. They fit into the characters so well you would think they were actually real people. Although I never really enjoy movies with either of these actors I thought this film was very well done. I give it a 10/10! A film of brilliance, heartbreak, rebellion, and a wild adventure. Knowing that they directed this movie I thought the plot would be awful but it really captured the essence of human nature. Matt and Ben really got into character and captured the true personality of two boys from 1980""s South Boston. From roaming the streets, bar fights, to the accents and the culture.<br/><br/>Will is a young boy at the bottom of the social pyramid who has lived a lonely, abusive life. He works as a janitor at MIT but is yet extremely intelligent and begins solving their problems that not even the professors could do. Because of his lifestyle and who he is it's not okay for him to express his intelligents to society.<br/><br/>This film tells a story that is quite common yet is hidden from the world. Will (Matt) is highly intelligent yet he never puts it to use. People continue to push him to move forward and use his abilities yet he chooses not to. He's at the bottom of the social pyramid but has the ability to be at the top. People read into him and he feels threatened by that so he tries to outsmart them by reading deeper into them tearing them apart. Just like any movie there is always a girl but it isn't all lovey dovey. This movie captures the struggle of love in which he struggles with from his early childhood. Will picks up a girl at the bar and they talk and grow closer until she falls in love with him. She tries to push him to do something with his abilities and be a part of his life but that scares him so he tells her he doesn't love her even though he truly does. He fears being loved and hurting her.<br/><br/>This movie really deals about vulnerability, fear, friendship, and of course love. Will feels vulnerable being loved by a woman. A relationship would make him have to open up in which he fears because he feels as if he doesn't deserve love. He fears the judgement. Robin shows how powerful love really is by talking about his wife whom even though is dead he constantly cherishes their moments together and shares them, his life still revolves around her, he expresses happiness then and now. Will is scared to share his potential with the world because he doesn't know what that might bring upon him and others. He's scared to see how society will view him. He enjoys his abilities but is fearful to put them into the world. Will's therapist whom is Robin Williams tries to read into Will in which Will begins to try and stab at him and this continues for multiple sessions and some sessions are just silent with no talking. Robin waits for Will to make the first move of speaking because he's not going to solve his problems for him. The most simple stories lead to the most valuable advice in which Will slowly starts to accept and they form a friendship. Eventually Will goes and gets the girl, he opens up and brings himself out there, he wants happiness and love. He started at the bottom and slowly climbs his way to the top.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is very well done. It's like a psych lesson. This movie is relate able to real life because there are many people out there just like Will and yet we turn a blind eye to them and they never get to express their true potential. The movies ends unknowingly just like real life, we never know where we will end up we can only imagine what will happen to us next and proceed to take those steps. It captures the human nature that we are too afraid to bring ourselves too. Highly interesting, charismatic, brilliant, rebelling film."
"grundybr","9","1","2","29 May 2019"," Its all about the relationships
","Good Will Hunting is the type of movie that you could go back and watch over and over again without it getting old. As a spectator, the cast did an amazing job making you feel like you were living in the movie in southie, particularly the scene where Robin Williams talks to Matt Damon while they sit on the bench in the park and is giving the young genius advice after they have a rocky first meeting. Robin Williams is talking to Matt Damon in a stern way telling him the way he goes about everything is that of a coward, but he makes it sound so calming. The way Ben Affleck tells his best friend he has to move on and do something with his life and even gets his friend a car despite his lack of wealth just to see his friend succeed is very moving to see that everyone is helping this one young man.<br/><br/>
The ending is where I docked points from my review. Skylar is a key role in the movie because Will is clearly in love with her but he drives her away because of his defensive mechanism to not get too attached to people because of his rough abused past. She leaves and wants Will to join but he originally does not, but at the end he came to realize he had to go see about a girl, but the movie cuts off with Will driving on the highway to go to her but they didnt show him actually get there."

","This film is a 10/10, it revealed to me that being vulnerable and communicating with others is needed to over come our traumas. Will expresses intelligence instead of vulnerability throughout the film so he doesn't have to confront his emotions. Sean was one person who helped Will shed the layers of built up traumas that were holding him back from his true potential. The end of the Film was satisfying knowing that Will makes a move out of true love."
"dereksorensen","8","1","2","24 May 2019"," Excellent job from a couple of Hollywood newbies.
","Good Will Hunting has been acclaimed as one of the most inspirational, tear-jerking films of the late 90's. The script is extremely impressive considering that it came from two Hollywood no-names: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Well, they were back then anyways).<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did the impossible by delivering a great script while successfully acting in their first big time film. While watching this film, it is easy to tell how genuine the dialogue really is. The dialogue is then capitalized on by great acting from every actor in the film. Matt, Ben, Robin Williams, and the rest of the cast all hit home-runs with their on screen performance. It is easy for the audience to forget that they are watching actors.<br/><br/>It's simple. Unique writing + realistic acting + inspiring story + good cinematography techniques = a darn good movie.
Good Will Hunting fulfills that equation easily.<br/><br/>However, the movie does fall a bit short from doing what it could have done . Much of the writing, being focused on realism, did a little too good at its job. Often, we find the screen play diving a bit too deep into dialogue that has little to do with the plot. Sure, its okay to portray the characters and their personalities in their bar-to-bar shenanigans; however, it does not help the flow of emotion that the viewers in the audience need to feel.
Simply put, the film lacks balance. If the film had been a bit more efficient with its comical relief and had spent more time developing the emotion of the characters, big emotional moments in the film would have felt even bigger. It is important that a story line flows with balanced progressive emotion until it hits its apex scene. Good Will Hunting's story line simply lacks the flow as the emotional scenes are scattered between scenes of passive unrelated dialogue. This makes the big emotional moments feel a bit over-dramatic when they arrive.<br/><br/>Other than that, this film's screen play his a winning lottery ticket (see what I did there?).<br/><br/>Great movie. I would recommend. I watched this film edited to take out the100+ F-bombs and I still enjoyed it very much."
"Ed-from-HI","9","1","2","19 May 2019"," Unpretentious and 'real' a very human portrait about 'lost' souls just trying to locate their authentic selves.....
","Good Will Hunting is most definitely one of the finest films of the 1990's reflecting quite an achievement in terms of feeling very 'real' and conveying a sense of genuine humanity in the complex-characterization of 'Will Hunting' who has abundant cognitive/analytical 'gifts' but due to a pronounced lack of stable/ reliable emotional-connections in his early years, has built a vast array of overt & covert 'defense-mechanisms' ensuring that no one will ever get the better of him, since he will never let anyone close enough to even begin to do so.<br/><br/>Usually films containing this type of subject matter (eg. struggles of a 'prodigy') could easily come-off as a combination: pretentious, overly sentimental, and basically not in any way believable or genuinely moving. Portrayals of 'geniuses' can be maddeningly hard to watch and difficult to empathize with in most films (due to the persistent danger of 'head-in-the-clouds' pretense or the general lack of commonality of experience). But miraculously, Will Hunting's characterization (as essayed by Matt Damon) is actually the polar-opposite of a stereotypical 'genius' and in fact seems to have a marked aversion to any such conventional notions!<br/><br/>Matt Damon perfectly captures the spirit of the intellectually gifted-rebel, with a boat-load of 'chips' on his shoulders; and Minnie Driver is fantastic as 'Skylar' the Harvard University/biology student (and no intellectual slouch herself) who takes a distinct liking to Will, and seems to possess a similarly irreverent/ non-conventional rebellious inner 'spirit' that might just be compatible? Of course, things are not so simple, and Will's old instinctive ultra-defense mechanisms (somewhat self-destructive of course), again kick into high-gear ==> acutely-activated whenever someone gets a bit too close!<br/><br/>Enter psychologist Dr. Sean Maguire a deeply empathic & authentic role for which Robin Williams won Best supporting Actor (a truly remarkable multi-dimensional performance indeed). Williams' movingly effective portrayal is that of a highly compassionate-intelligent psychologist who, even after much initial maddening frustration ==> slowly begins breaking-down some of Will's intricately constructed barricades and psychological mine-fields. Where Robin Williams' thespian prowess really shines is the moment we realize that Dr. Maguire might actually be as internally-broken and uncertain about his own self-identity as Will is (at least in relation to the early loss of Dr. Maguire's Wife & great-love, which left the good Doctor emotionally rudderless for a long while).<br/><br/>There is also a very satisfying (and again highly realistic) conclusion to this film. When I first saw this many years ago, I kept thinking this is a really great film so far, but I bet they will blow the Ending with some overly-sentimental hard-to-believe finale.
But Director Gus Van Sant, Matt Damon & Ben Affleck (who of course, wrote the brilliantly-believable Script) didn't let the audience down, and ""Good Will Hunting"" remains one of the finest Films of the entire 1990's!"
"fragsman","9","1","2","13 May 2019"," Brutal acting. Loved the acting really...
","I will start saying that I didn't gave a 10 just because Will character was unbelievable: A mix of genious nerd, tough fighter and way cool guy. It was at least strange.<br/><br/>Nonwithstanding what I've said this film is amazing. Perhaps you think the whole plot is ""simple"" and ""predictable"" but it was 1997. Besides 95% of nowadays movies have horrid and repetitive plots copying each other.<br/><br/>I will base all my review on the acting is magnificent.<br/><br/>I'm a very observant person. I have seen many movies before but there were so many scenes when I really felt the character feelings.<br/><br/>a) When Will is Laughing so hard when talking with Sean (either is well played or someone told him a very good joke, no one can act such a good laugh)
b) Also Krystyn after telling his joke at the bar spilling the beer
c) When Chuckie is telling the story of the police and the guys were interrupting .. it looked SO real, It seemed they were a bit drunk to make it more realistic.
d) The most important when they are Will and Krystyn are in bed. Most of movies shows two characters with the classic stupid sex scene showing movements under blankets, feets, hands, kisses and then oh.. they were really there, laughing while - before or after having sex and having a conversaition, they looked like a couple.<br/><br/>After all I said the movie is great because of how Sean find himself motivated to reach Will's heart. And he got it because he was special. The character never dissapoints.<br/><br/>Some people might just prefer watching Jason Staham destroying faces with his fist or Incredible Hulk smashing War Taks but this film is amazing, don't deny it."

","""Good Will Hunting"" grew on me slowly as I watched it, had an urge to want to turn it off a couple of times while watching but it all came down to one simple truth - this movie is great.
It tells a story of a young man who doesn't know his place in life and wastes most of it drinking in a bar with friends, getting into fights occasionally and doing some crappy jobs. And literally no one would blame him for it, we've all been there. But one day a time comes along and it gives you people who challenge you to get out of your shell and find your path, help you become a better person. I think everyone needs something like this movie in his life to re-evaluate it and see it in the different light.
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's script, although a bit predictable and immature, is almost perfect despite that. The story gives you everything you want from a movie, it gives you time to roll on your back with laughter and to cry your eyes out, gives you food to think and thoughts to hold on to. Robin Williams is brilliant, he's phenomenal, he's the best thing in this movie and his closing line - amazing. Took the words right out of my mouth. Matt Damon's performance is near perfection and one of the best in his career.

"gaxiola_fk","10","1","2","7 September 2018"," Masterpiece in script and acting.
","Good Will Hunting by Gus Van Sant (1997)
Well, is hard to say how beautiful this film is. It really is all about the characters and the script. This film is a drama of big proportions unfolding the complexity of human mind and life. The film shows us Will Hunting as a journey to discover the real self of a human with a great gift and a troubled past that is actually stopping him.
Will Hunting is nobody, someone that works cleaning and in a construction work doing nothing really impulsive in his life; but the professor Lambeau discovered him and his potential as student, a young man that come from a dysfunctional family and gets in trouble for fun.
This is where the movie makes one of their greatest movements, the introduction of a psychologist that can handle with Will's defensive position. Sean played by Robin Williams is the soul of the movie, he is in charge of discover Will's inner feelings and in order to achieve that he gets obligated to open up his heart too.
This is where the real action begins, and by action you know what I mean. Is surprisingly difficult to get to someone that can make you think that you were always wrong in 5 minutes. For Sean it took 1 night of repentance and another number of sessions.
The funny is that despite Will looks like a hard like rock person, he's actually weak and is afraid of everything. Sean needed to share what love means to him, what her wife meant to him and what he passed through when she got sick to fully interpret what is life about.
Will's reality is that, as we saw with Skylar, he's afraid of losing someone that he loves, and there are many reasons. He was abandoned by the ones that were supposed to love him the most and fell in families full of abuse and violence
And the only and most difficult thing to do is to accept that is not his fault to actually be like he is, his personality is a combination of the way he reacts to events and the events that he went through. And even when sometimes is not easy, humans are much stronger than you can think.
Talking about the script, is a masterpiece written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, with powerful messages to deliver and a set of words and letter that are not doing anything more than making you empathize with some of the best-developed characters in my film experience."

"hfhotaling","10","1","2","26 March 2018"," Good Will Hunting Stands as a Model on How to do a Low-Budget Film Right
","Good Will Hunting's plot follows troubled custodian Will Hunting (Matt Damon) as he tries to navigate relationships and life in 1997 Boston and Cambridge. Throughout the 126 minute film, Will's ego and psyche are challenged by the weathered Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) while finding something inside of himself he did not know he had with Skylar (Minnie Driver). This excellent and complex plot coupled with the outstanding music from the late Elliot Smith create an unforgettable atmosphere from start to finish. <br/><br/>The screenplay finds a precise balance between distress and happiness which gives the film a unique footprint for future scripts to follow. The script is penned by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also has a role in the film. During the writing stage of the production Gus Van Sant- the director of the film- visited Damon and Affleck frequently and later critiqued their writing method in the Introduction to the published screenplay: ""Ben and Matt would fly into action and create something almost spontaneously with Matt standing in the middle of the hotel room demonstratively gesturing and editing ideas by drawing dotted lines in the air with his hands, with Ben writing down dialogue on his laptop computer."" This spontaneous yet structured dialogue can be seen throughout the film, excellently mastered by the acting chops of Robin Williams and film royalty Stellan Skarsg√•rd. <br/><br/>Robin Williams delivers a more controlled and stable character as opposed to his mostly zany and comical repertoire. His character arguably grows as much as the main protagonist throughout the film as he needs to open up in order to mentor Will Hunting. In the famous ""pond scene"" Williams delivers- in my opinion- one of the greatest film monologues of all time, creating a father-figure character in less than five minutes. However, Williams does not waste a chance to shine in comedy during a completely improvised scene about two thirds through the film.<br/><br/>Independent films today have grown to focus more on art than narrative, which lowers the quality of the film. When there is little-to-no narrative in your film, there is nothing for your audience to connect with. An example of this problem in more modern cinema is the film The Mountain Between Us. While the film captures awe-inspiring landscapes, the dialogue and narrative is so poor it is hard to feel any sort of connection with the characters whatsoever. For reasons and examples like these, this is why I believe that Good Will Hunting stands as a model on how to do a low-budget film right."

","Good Will Hunting (1997) stars Matt Damon as Will Hunting, Ben Affleck as Chuckie, Robin Williams as Sean, Minnie Driver as Skylar, and Stellan Skarsgard as Professor Lambeau. The film was directed by Gus Van Sant.<br/><br/>The story is about Will Hunting, a twenty-year-old genius raised in abusive foster homes. He is working as a janitor at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) through the Parole Employee Program. His intelligence could provide him a lucrative career, but he is most comfortable living in his run-down South Boston neighborhood spending his free time with his three loud, abrasive best friends.<br/><br/>He has landed in court several times for assault and theft, each time representing himself and getting the cases dismissed. Watching Will destroy his life, a theme begins to emerge - if you allow your fears to control your life, you're not really living. Will's fear of where his intelligence can take him combined with his fears of getting close to people are controlling his life.<br/><br/>Will is in court again, this time for beating up a bully from his childhood he ran into on the street. The judge will not dismiss the case and Will is facing jail time. At the same time, Will caught the attention of Professor Lambeau, a Professor of Math at MIT, by solving an extremely difficult math problem he left on a chalkboard in the hallway of the school.<br/><br/>Professor Lambeau convinced the judge to release Will under the conditions that Will meets with Professor Lambeau and a therapist weekly until his 21st birthday. It is at this point that Will meets Sean, the only therapist Will is unable to drive away. Will begins a relationship with Skylar, a girl he meets in a Harvard bar, who he both pulls in and pushes away, fearing she won't want to be with him if she knows the real him. The relationship ends when she moves to California to attend Stanford University. She wanted Will to go with her, but his insecurities caused him to break up with her instead.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film the viewer sees Will begin to change, forcing him to face his fears and anger created by his childhood. His breakthrough comes during one emotional and poignant meeting with Sean. By the end of the film, the theme appears again in both Will and Sean. Both characters ultimately choose the chance for happiness over the safety of their fears.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is reminiscent of A Beautiful Mind in the sense that they are both damaged men with genius IQs, but the desire to overcome their limitations comes from the heart.<br/><br/>Director Van Sant makes use of the aerial shot, especially in Will's run-down neighborhood. The viewer gets a real feel of the closeness of the buildings and the bustle and noise of the streets. Van Sant walks the viewer through the growing relationship between Will and Sean by keeping them separate on screen for most of their appointments. It is only after Will has his breakthrough with Sean that they are in the shot together for an extended emotional and heartfelt scene.<br/><br/>Van Sant's use of sound, both onscreen and off, helps the viewer stay in touch with the mood of the scene, whether it's the busy streets of South Boston, or the quiet halls of MIT.<br/><br/>I give this film ten stars, from the original screenplay to the final product. If you have a couple of hours and want to watch a film that will stay with you long after the final credits, then I recommend Good Will Hunting."

","Twenty-year-old Will Hunting of South Boston works as a janitor at MIT, despite him being a self-taught mathematical genius. He spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Morgan, and Billy. After solving a difficult high-level math problem on a chalkboard in the hallways of MIT, his talent is discovered by Professor Lambeau, who decides to help Will reach his full potential. When Will gets in a fight and is arrested for attacking a police officer, Professor Lambeau takes a deal to get leniency for Will if he gets treatment from therapist Sean Maguire. Although the movie plunges into and addresses the emotions of each character, like the psychological trauma that Will experiences, it still manages to incorporate lots of humor. There are many instances where the witty banter and hilarious exchanges, especially between Will and his friends, cause the audience to immediately respond with a laugh.
 ""Good Will Hunting"" was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who portray the two best friends, Will and Chuckie. One might stipulate that the writing and on-screen connection between the two would be mediocre, considering that Damon and Affleck were just in college when they began writing the script and the fact that they were not the big named actors that they are now. But, because Damon and Affleck are actually childhood besties in really life, they make the friendship between Will and Chuckie (and even with Billy and Morgan) all the more authentic. Their friendship and loyalty towards each other is the glue that keeps the movie together; they accept each other for who they are. The already well established relationship between Damon and Affleck reinforces their performances, reminding the audience that family does not just come in one form. Damon and Affleck didn't just grow up as best friends, they also grew up on Boston, which is where the movie is set. The movie included many scenes that were actually shot in the city. For example, the famous scene where Sean has a heart-to-heart talk with Will at a park was actually shot at Boston Public Garden. The movie has had such an impact on audiences that the bench where the conversation took place became a memorial for Robin Williams after his passing.
 Not only is the bond between Will and Chuckie unmistakable, but also their character development throughout the movie. Usually, the main character in a movie is moving towards a goal and the audience is rooting for them along the way. But, in this film, that is not the case. Will Hunting is not someone who embraces his intellectual gift and, in fact, seems to be against accepting it at all. This sort-of creates a frustration in the audience which, in turn, makes them root for him even more since they want him to learn to embrace it. The movie may seem typical-about some genius kid-but it actually touches upon two very important topics. First off, it addresses the psychology of Will. The movie dives into the psychology of Will and how the psychological traumas from his past have affected him all the way to adulthood. Also, in the movie, Will is faced with a decision: to use his intellectual gift to its full potential, or to pursue love. Just like how Chuckie hopes for Will to be gone one day when he comes to pick him up, the audience wishes for Will to embrace his gift and reach his full potential. But, it isn't that simple for Will and he has to learn to follow his heart and what he thinks is best for him. This screenplay, written by Damon and Affleck was nominated and won an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe, for ""Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen"".
 Just by looking at the cast, you can tell that the acting is going to be top-notch. Every role in this movie was cast perfectly and the actors performances were always in-character. The chemistry between Minnie Driver (Skylar) and Matt Damon (Will) is undeniable. Even though Damon wasn't yet a big-named actor, his performance was powerful. Skylar and Will's interactions were effortless, making the audience root for them without the writers needing to keep all the focus on them throughout the movie. No one could play the role of Sean better than Robin Williams. The dialogue that he delivered in the Boston Public Garden became so famous and resonated with so many that, when he passed, the bench where he delivered it became a memorial for him. Robin Williams won an Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" for his wonderful performance as Will's therapist/mentor, Sean. The performances were incredibly powerful and believable, and definitely one of the biggest reasons why this movie was so successful and is so loved.
 Despite the frequent use of vulgar language and the predictability of the overarching plot, ""Good Will Hunting"" is still definitely worth a watch. Although the opening minutes of the movie are slow, the movie as a whole presents a refreshingly enjoyable story of a mathematical genius who is, unexpectedly, relatable as he struggles with the psychological trauma from his past as well as the task of finding his true purpose in life."

","Some of my all-time favorite movie scenes come from this movie. There are amazing messages and themes regarding socioeconomics, talent, love, etc. All of these aspects of life are intertwined into one, beautifully written movie. Countless insights on these aforementioned aspects that I had never thought about were presented in this movie; so in a way this movie changed my view on life to a certain extent. Robin Williams is moving as always, and I believe this is his best role. The sum of extraordinary scenes produces my favorite movie of all time. Not to mention the story of how this movie was written. Pure genius."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","1","2","27 February 2018"," Its central performances are phenomenal and its inevitable emotional release is truly powerful.
","The genius of 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' isn't in its plotting or its resolution or even its character arcs per say (which are all a little formulaic or clich√©d to an extent), but rather in the nuanced and realistic journey that that these almost fully-formed people take to reach the conclusions you know they eventually will. The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams' subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon's frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10"
"studioAT","5","1","2","30 October 2016"," Robin William's is great. The rest of the film is average
","'Good Will Hunting' is a film of two halves for me. There's loads of fairly uninteresting 'buddy scenes' between Damon and Affleck, and any scene involving Minnie Driver's character is a write off, but in the middle of all of that dross is an amazing performance from the late, great Robin Williams.<br/><br/>His scenes with Matt Damon are so good. In fact if you could go on You Tube and watch only those bits I'd suggest it. Williams remains the warm and funny legend that we've seen in his comedies, but here he is also slightly more guarded and restrained. The poetry of the dialogue and his delivery all match up to make for some lovely moments.<br/><br/>It's just a shame that they appear in an uneven film, that is F-bomb heavy and at times slow."
"mathildaevelina","6","1","2","28 September 2014"," It's an old movie, but it still got important things to tell
","I watched this movie in my English class. It's a movie about a guy named Will, who is very aggressive and tries to play cool in front of his friends.He's also a math genie but doesn't do anything about his talent. Behind his facade there is something a little deeper about his behavior, something about a childhood that was ruined and about an insecure boy. He is about to go to jail, when a teacher saves him, and makes him go to therapy. This movie is all about a guy who has a hard time trusting people and letting them in, also about why people can be so aggressive sometimes and that it all can be a misunderstanding. I thought this movie was pretty good, because I can relate to Will and because the actors were great. Even tho the movie is about 17 years old it still focuses on important things that can happen to anyone. I thought this movie was good. There's a scene in the movie where Will and Skylar has a fight, I think that scene is important because it shows that Will is vulnerable and that he also got feelings."

","A case where Hollywood lucks out and 2 young writers/actors come along and create a masterful script that tricks Robin Williams to do a sequel to Dead Poets Society.

Calculus replaces poetry with a hint of matrices to come.<br/><br/>Outside of setting and soundtrack mistakes of Gus Van Sant's mid-life crisis and 1970s revelry that makes this film seem a decade older than his classic My Own Private Idaho (1991), the first half is genius. Then, he and Robin Williams turn it into more of a seize the girl, love-will-save-you clich√© than an outside-the-matrix, seize your genius modern-day intellectual fantasy.<br/><br/>Despite the probably unintentional attempts to subvert it and the annoying product placement that had taken over Hollywood, the story is an adult male intellectual/geek fantasy.

Considering how effective the movie usually was, it was very irritating to have a couple of scenes that didn't seem to work.  But it was still a great movie, thanks in large part to a generally solid script and terrific acting by everyone involved, especially Robin Williams, who should give up comedies entirely, since he's such a tremendous talent when given a dramatic part.

"empalm-58338","8","1","3","16 January 2019"," Wicked good movie for all to enjoy
","Good Will Hunting is a timeless classic, that won countless awards, including an Oscar, a Golden Globe and multiple nominees. This movie relays on the acting and bad boy personality of Matt Damon. Throughout the movie the audience follows the life and what his actions do to others. While this movie was released in the 90's, I still enjoyed and understood the film. The themes and underlying messages also still transfer over to today's day and age. I was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. The film captured my attention as I felt many different real emotions, because of the angles/shots, soundtrack and script.
In the opening scene you get a look at how rickety Will's (Matt Damon) life is in the south side of Boston. Along with this you get aerial views and pan shots of Boston to set the scene. I enjoyed the setting because it showed the rich high life society of Cambridge but also the desolate housing and college pubs.
With having it set at MIT is a bit of a cliche, in the sense that of course Will should belong at MIT because of his intelligence. A positive to being set at MIT is that the writers were able to compare Will to the smartest students and professors in the nation.
One of my favorite scenes was the one in which Will met Skylar (Minnie Driver). Will showed off his wicked smarts, and by the end of the night he got her phone number. Matt Damon has a comedic line about apples. By adding this joke I believe it helps to captivate the audience before the movie shifts to being more serious.
Skylar's has some personality quirks. She always seems give the excuse that she needs to study and work hard, on the other hand Matt Damon has the natural talent to read something and memorize it. She believes in Matt and wants him to succeed in life and have a chance. Everyone but Will believes in his potential. With his rough childhood background he has never been rewarded of his accomplishments.
Will has many struggles in his life and doesn't know how to balance his math intelligence with his social life. As a result Will seems to get in trouble continuously but has become a manipulating and is able to get him out of many situations. But on the judges last straw he sends Will to jail, and the only reason he got out was because of the MIT professor. One of the conditions that Will has to agree to though is to go to therapy. After the Professor sends Will to therapy will opens up about his past and his trust issues.
One important theme that I took away from Good Will Hunting was that child abuse and a rough childhood can lead to trust issues. Much like Will's childhood with abuse and multiple homes, Matilda (Mara Wilson) grew up with child abuse and until she was finally able to trust her teacher and create a lasting bond. Another aspect that connects both movies is that both Will and Matilda are brilliant as a result of reading hundreds of books.
It's easy to relate to how heartbroken Robin Williams is with his wife dying. I feel that by put his time into therapy he is able to escape his grief. I really enjoyed his eccentric storytelling of the day he met his wife. This scene added to how Robin Williams was able to balance his grief with remembering the joyous memories.
The shots and angles in this film were also well put together. During most of Will's therapy sessions the director uses eye level and medium shots. By using this effect the director is able to have the audience feel like they are in the room. Along with this the readers are forced to read the facial expressions to get a sense of emotion. During every therapy session but the last both Sean and Will are not in the same shot together. By creating this composition it creates the effect of a real conversation that goes back and forth. Another example of how the director used angles/shots was when he strategically used a high angle shot to show power and dominance. This scene occurred while Will burned the proofs and Professor (Stellan Skarsgard) was on his knees and the camera angle was above him. Will's power over his own life shows true here because of the element of a high shot.
The fight scene is a notable scene because of the sounds and music in the background. The music is very subtle, and there is multiple layers of other peoples voices, but overall the directors were able to edit it together to make it feel like the audience was in the right scene. and finally there is a cop car that skids to a start and arrests Matt Damon. The soundtrack for the remainder of the film is very well thought and adds to either the suspense, happiness of craziness going on in Matt Damon's life.
The script includes dialect that is noticeably a Boston accent. There was the use of wicked which is a famous Boston stereotype. The accents were also very strong on Matt Damon and his Southie friends like Ben Affleck. I think it was a wise decision to cast Matt Damon and Ben Affleck because of their natural Boston accents.
The ending to me was a bit predictable, in scenes earlier you were foreshadowed by what was ahead. Also in most movies there is a happy ending and this movie does just that. The director also left with a bit of a cliffhanger which in today's movies is expected to have the audience create their own ending.
By the end of the movie I felt attached to Will's character and Sean's grief, and the romance between Skylar and Will. Good Will Hunting was a classic movie that will be enjoyed by many in the coming years. I would definitely recommend putting in the time to watch and enjoy Good Will Hunting."

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","3","22 July 2018"," Sad inability to communicate
","A very serious film with Matt Damon playing his own age and Robin Williams playing his favorite role, that of a teacher, slightly mental manipulator, getting into the brain and mind of a young chap and getting his wings burnt, though this time not by the death or sacrifice of the young man. But somewhere it is very sad.<br/><br/>Will Hunting, the young man, is, in fact, a delinquent with a lot of misdemeanors but he is a mathematical genius, in fact, an Asperger case who is able to enter any mathematical problem within seconds and solve it. On the other hand, he can read a book something like twenty pages every thirty seconds. He is thus a prison inmate under some kind of probation or suspension that enables him to have a job - for inmates on parole - and have a life. That's how he ends up being a janitor in one top university in the USA and there he comes across the challenges a medaled and decorated math professor gives to students to be checked and solved with a piece of chalk on a blackboard (that is actually green) in the corridor. And Will Hunting does it twice. The professor takes him under his protection and the judge imposes two conditions. Apart from not getting involved in any misdemeanor, Will Hunting has to follow the math program imposed by the professor and he has to see a shrink. <br/><br/>The second condition makes him finally meet (the sixth professional head shrink) Sean Maguire and the worst possible happens. They cannibalize each other. Will transfers himself into the head shrink or counselor whose wife is dead and who is still in love with her. So he finally gets into the car his friends have given him and drives to California where his rich girlfriend has just moved at the end of her university time. On the other side, Sean transfers himself into the young man who has no set home, no haven he can go to, no attachment whatsoever and he decides to do the same and move to China. Will leaves a note in Sean's mailbox before leaving and the conclusion is pathetic on the side of the older man: he plainly accuses Will to have stolen his life since he is going after his girlfriend instead of the brilliant prospect he could have in this university, just life Sean missed a historic baseball game just to go meet his girlfriend who will become his wife who is now dead. <br/><br/>Something though seems to be missing in the film. An Asperger chap is not only a reciting machine or an analyzing drone. An Asperger is also a person who has a very strong inner fantasizing life that can even be close to illusionary hallucinations. Will Hunting as for that is very superficial. It is a choice of the director but that makes the character rather frivolous. It is true Asperger cases do not like speaking of themselves but they love telling stories that are all either distantly erudite or purely imaginary. And here we have a young man who is very locked up onto himself and who can only get out by being physically or verbally violent. <br/><br/>Good entertainment though.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie.

Will's keen intellect, thirst for knowledge, and a tight- knit group of friends serve as his primary bulwarks against his troubles. Yet even these are unable to fully help Will. Will is unwillingly ""discovered"" by a senior MIT professor after he (easily) solves a complex algebra equation that proves to be the bane of student and faculty alike. Through this Will meets Sean (played by Robin Williams) a professor at a local community college who soon finds himself being one of the few people being able to meaningfully connect with Will. Along the way Will meets a sophisticated Harvard undergrad named Skyler. The two hit it off and begin a relationship, yet Will struggles to connect with her as his deep fear of abandonment prevent him from getting attached to her, let alone anyone, outside his ""group."" This fear hides within it a heavy reluctance to embrace his God-given gifts and realize his immense potential, and ultimately better his future. The story, the cast, the performances, the character dynamics, oh where do I begin???!!! I could rave about them all, but for fear of being redundant I will refrain from doing so. Go see this movie. It is such a wonderful film."

","Good Will Hunting is a movie about Will Hunting, a misunderstood poor boy from South Boston, who has a genius-level IQ and works as a janitor at a university. He solves a near-impossible math problem that takes professionals years to master, and is given the offer to be one of the smartest mathematicians ever, but after getting in a fight with a police officer, he is sent to Dr. Sean Maguire to have therapy sessions. What starts as a reluctant bonding session turns into a budding friendship that changes his world.<br/><br/>For one, let me talk about the story behind this film. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon both starred and wrote this movie, (both of them unknown at the time) and ever since then, it's one of the most successful indie films of all time.<br/><br/>I think everyone should watch this movie. I say that about a lot of films but this time I mean it. It gives older adults a look at what a teenager/college student's life is like, and it gives younger viewers a look at what to expect, and a guide to surviving it.<br/><br/>Not only that, but all the actors and actresses do an amazing job. Most people know Robin Williams as a funny actor, but this is his best and most serious role. He's better as a serious actor then a comedy actor in my opinion. Sort of like how Jim Carrey was good in The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and those are all serious flicks.<br/><br/>Seriously, check this film out. Definitely mandatory viewing for everyone."
"Floated2","10","1","3","3 July 2016"," One of a kind original story
","Good Will Hunting takes place in Boston, which is where actor Matt Damon and Ben Affleck grew up together. It's not the Boston most people are familiar with, the Boston Common, the Charles River and the famous attractions. Instead, much of action takes place in the grittiness of Southie, or South Boston, shrouded in lower middle class desperation. <br/><br/>Starring into the film, key and title character Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at MIT. He is in trouble with the law, getting into street and bar brawls. One day at work, he solves a complex mathematical problem left on a blackboard. A professor discovers his incredible intellect and rescues him from a jail stint for assault. In return for his probation, he must get counseling. After some funny scenes where he disposes of some psychiatrists by psychoanalyzing them, he finally meets his match in Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a psychiatrist who grew up in his old neighborhood. McGuire is just as tough as Hunting and is smart enough to see through his defenses.<br/><br/>Later into the film, Will Hunting also meets and falls in love with Skylar (Minnie Driver). Gradually McGuire and Skylar begin to lower Hunting's defenses until a crisis of courage is reached. In the process of healing Hunting, McGuire is also healed. McGuire has to reveal much of himself to Hunting in order to get his trust.<br/><br/>Written by Damon and Affleck, the screenplay is shown to be very smart, funny and emotionally moving. All of the performances are powerful. Good Will Hunting is almost 20 years old, though it still has a feel that is fresh to first time viewers."

","When you watch Good Will Hunting, you have to look past the Oscars and other awards it's gotten. Because beneath all that, it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful script written by two talented young men and acted out by equally talented actors such as Robin Williams, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>One of the most enjoyable parts of the movie was the psychological aspect. We have a typical 21 year old, going out and drinking with his friends, getting in fights etc., but underneath all that there's so much more to him. This movie tells us that we shouldn't look at the surface alone, there is so much more to people.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was incredible, Matt Damon played the role of Will Hunting without fault, he displayed the emotions, the cockiness, he displayed how Will was closed off due to his childhood trauma and he displayed how Will shrouded his weakness with smart talk and intellect. Robin Williams played the therapist Sean Maguire, a man who has seen life unlike the life his fellow academics have, on the battlefield in Vietnam. He recently lost his wife, who he regarded as his soulmate and best friend.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his out of this world genius. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben Affleck. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will's talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will's intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship. Yes there is a girl in the movie, but there isn't much focus on that aspect.<br/><br/>The fact that most of the people keep on talking about the probability of someone being as smart as Will tells us that this is a story, that this isn't real. Even so it relates to almost everyone who has been at Will's age. They have dealt with insecurities, fear of not being accepted, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's a beautiful movie, with a beautiful message and amazing effort from everyone in the cast and crew. Especially from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who co-wrote the script for this movie. It is definitely a must watch."

Actually i didn't put Minnie in my 12 best actresses list but i think i will do it as her English class is unique! She should have won the Oscar because she illuminates a rather transparent part (the serious student girlfriend) with original and personal input ! Robin is good as a humanist shrink but i won't go ahead as i can't really support a movie that supports psychological help : what says Robin can be found in any good philosophical book : life is about experiences, getting to know others and abuse victims aren't culprits. In other way, Affleck says it as good as Robin and without the qualifications: Will has everything to get a life so he must move his ass !"
"bwhalen0215","9","1","3","5 August 2013"," Good Will Hunting -- A MustsSee Film
","Good Will Hunting is an emotional roller coaster of a film. A surprisingly well written (and acted) film by two of today's biggest actors: Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting who is a genius trapped inside the body of a broken orphan, whose emotional damaged past has turned him into a reckless young adult. Will was a believable character with many quick, fluid, long-winded jabs that you would only expect out of the mouth of a well-read genius. His brilliance is discovered by Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard), and leads him to meeting psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and love interest Skylar (Minnie Driver). Will struggles to find himself, stuck within the disconnect from his past, but finds ways to cope through Sean, Skylar, and best friend Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck).<br/><br/>The main theme of this film is being able to watch Will find connection with others and allow himself to trust and love someone else. As he progresses through the movie, we see him meet Skylar and evolve through the relationship. We also see his bond and relationship with Sean, grow and progress into respect, trust, and friendship. <br/><br/>Another theme of the movie are the many arrays of sociological and psychological issues with every character. Will is constantly battling with his past and the ability to trust, we also see his aggression built up from all of this. Chuckie also has similar aggression issues that we are able to witness in the bar scenes, most likely these are sociological issues from how and where he grew up. Sean is secretly battling the loneliness after losing his wife and too stubborn to open up about it to someone and move on with his life. We later see that Professer Lambeau is upset that his life and reputation has not progressed as far as he would have liked and he has some pent up feelings about this. <br/><br/>Another movie with this similar theme would be the recent, Silver Linings Playbook. The two main characters played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, are struggling with themselves and their relationships. Yet you come to realize that they are not the only ones with these same inner struggles.<br/><br/>The film techniques are well hidden yet are able to bring this movie to life in a very sneaky way. The scenes when Will visits Sean in his office are often allowing us to see the distance between the two's relationship. We only see one character at a time, or we just see the shoulder of Sean while the camera continues to focus on Will. Gradually as the movie progresses the two are both seen on screen together, portraying that Will's trust in Sean is growing.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie we see a short scene of Will reading in his apartment. The camera slowly pulls back, allowing us to view the emptiness around him. This gives us an early look at how Will is in his life. He is alone and disconnected from others. <br/><br/>The use of parallel cutting in the movie allows us to see everything going on at once with the characters. The most prominent of these scenes is at the end where the film cuts between Will leaving a note for Sean, Chuckie stopping to pick Will up from his house, and Sean packing up his things to leave. I think this parallel cutting technique is reminiscent of Will's life and how there are always many things going on in that great mind of his. This movie as a whole is a very realistic and thorough story of a brilliant young man, with a troubling past, who is trying to find himself and allow others to find him. I would highly recommend this film to anyone trying to find one of the best written and acted films of our generation."

"HelenMary","7","1","3","13 May 2013"," immediate classic that propelled Affleck & Damon to stardom
","This is a difficult film to rate as the fact that Affleck and Damon wrote it and it did so well, and the screenplay is so good is distracting. All the performances are good but it is the relationship between Matt Damon's Will and Robin Williams' Psychologist Sean that is the most compelling and the genius of the piece. Will Hunting is a broken yet incredibly intelligent young man who's not had the breaks in life, finds inspiration and meaning in his sessions with a compulsory therapist.<br/><br/>Minnie Driver as the love interest gives one of her best roles but isn't a main character but the catalyst for some of Will's breakthroughs. Affleck as the self-sacrificing best friend plays a typical character for him, and I do wonder how they decided who would play which character given that they chose the best combination; Matt Damon as a boy-next-door genius and brokenness was perfect given that Affleck would have been more striking, pretty-boy privilege, bringing his angry intelligence (see Boiler Room) which wouldn't have been so attracting nor so inducing of empathy. Gus Van Sant's straight almost dull direction - given his spacey trippy and arty direction in other films - is ideal for the story and his choices with the screenplay for the style of the fast-paced dialogue, especially in the Williams/Damon therapy sessions, was superb. Clearly Affleck and Damon have a very clear and insightful knowledge and experience of psychology. However, the rest of the film - which the dialogue/screenplay distracts from - is average, with some special moments, but predictable and a bit Hollywood. It is, however, rightly, an immediate modern classic and Robin Williams and Matt Damon (and Ben Affleck for the writing credit with Damon) rightly were praised to high heaven for their performances. A great film in parts but a good film in general."

I recommend a movie to anyone who wants something more than cheap, entertaining action movie. To sum up, the message is quite exceptional.

","A movie that amazed me from start to finish. The way that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this amazing story about a ""bad boy disturbed"" that the inside is a true genius.

Matt Damon it is superb, and it grabs his character (which he wrote) so impressive and credible; Robin Williams in one of his best roles, his character is the most beloved and fun (and a little perturbed), the entire cast does a phenomenal job, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, all perfect. The film teaches us that we all have a soul mate, not a romantic, but one that challenges us and transforms us what we are in the future ... (I wish have both).

"jovanajovanajovana6","10","1","3","19 March 2013"," Good .. Excellent Will Hunting
","The first thing that draw my attention when I opened this movie on IMDb was this lovely, warm picture of Matt Damon and Robin Williams. By the expression on their faces, it seemed like a movie filled with emotions and after seeing it I realized how right I had been. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is so well organized. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. They devoted enough time for every aspect of Will's character. Nothing was done in haste. First half of the movie is about his intelligence, about him and his Professor trying to improve his skills. And the other half highlights completely different side of him. It shows wide range of emotions that we hadn't known he felt. That even he hadn't known he felt. Throughout the movie, the story is developing slowly but surely and it's full of catchy lines and witty phrases. <br/><br/>Another amazing thing about this movie is his excellence, Robin Williams. His portrayal of Sean Maguire is one of the best I've ever seen. And also, character lived up to all my expectations. I had known that Robin is a psychologist before watching the movie, and I find such characters highly entertaining, but this one is, by far, my favourite. So intelligent man, and yet, full of pain because of the loss he had suffered. His love for his wife tugged at my heartstrings and made me cry from time to time. The way he talked about meeting her for the first time is, in my opinion, what love should be. <br/><br/>Though annoying he may seem, Prof. Gerald is not all that bad, in my opinion. Even though he completely neglected the emotional part of Will and was more concentrated on enhancing his skills, he had best interest in his heart for Will and I don't see that as a bad thing. He knows that life is hard and thinks that Will should use his smartness he was endowed with as much as he can.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, mixture of these two characters, Sean and Gerald, is the best parent Will could have ever had. The realistic one and sensitive one.<br/><br/>I must admit, to my shame, that before this movie I had never seen any movie starring Matt Damon, but he blew me away. His performance was impeccable. And Will .. oh, Will is just so amazing. No super- intelligent character has ever been that adorable. That scene where he degrades that Mr. ""know-it-all"" from Harvard was both charming and funny. Skylar and him are also adorable and one of the most natural screen couples I have ever seen. And the best thing is that in the end, with all bad things that have happened to him in life and all doubts he had in the movie, he gets a happy ending.<br/><br/>Also, the relationship between Will and Sean is so well-written. When they met Will was so arrogant, thinking he knows it all and started insulting Sean and making false presumptions about his life. Even though it offended him, he saw it as a challenge. He saw a kid who desperately needed help and accepted to see him in the future. The scene on the bench, in front of a lake is, the most touching and beautiful scenes ever made. Damon and Affleck are true artists for making this scene. And it was also the turning point for this relationship ‚Äì that's where Will realized that there's more to that man that he had previously thought. Not to mention ""It's not your fault"" part of the movie. The more he repeated that sentence the more I was falling in love with the movie. So powerful and , as I had mentioned, artistic.<br/><br/>In a word, the best movie I have ever seen and that's why I'm giving it a ten."

","This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I loved it so much, I watch it over and over again. This is an excellent film about a man who is an absolute math genius who could do anything as a job, but refuses to because of the demons he has in his mind. I love how good all of the characters are like Will(Matt Damon), Chuck(Ben Affleck), Sean(Robin Williams), and skylah(MInnie Driver). Matt and Ben's best film of their career. It goes through the horrible abuse Will Hunting faced as a child and how he overcomes it. We also find out late in the film that Sean the therapist also dealt with some abuse as a child. My favorite line is when will starts out by saying ""he used to just set a belt, a stick, and a wrench on the table and say choose"" then Sean says ""I would have to go with the belt"" then will says ""no I used to go with the wrench"" Sean says""why"" will says ""cause f*** him thats why"". Will was talking about his foster father because he used to be an orphan.Greatly scripted film and an unbelievable story."
"ey6476","9","1","3","19 February 2013"," Boston's Diamond in the Rough
","Even though he's from a blue-collar background in the South End of Boston, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is an undiscovered genius. Working as a janitor at Harvard University, he solves a complex equation on a blackboard which brings him to the attention of prestigious Math Professor, Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellen Skarsgard). When Will's troubled ways land him with a jail sentence, Lambeau reaches out and persuades the judge to release Will on the account that he'd be under Lambeau's supervision and would attend a weekly therapy session. This film, Good Will Hunting, is based on the clich√© that a zero can become a hero. There's also a bit of romance thrown in with a girl attending Harvard, played by Minne Driver. This film follows plenty of the movie- industry rules, as well as having an easily anticipated conclusion. But although Good Will Hunting may be a prime example of a predictable movie plot, the genuine presence the actors bring to the film, as well as the brilliantly written script, brings forth a new dimension in the story that makes this movie both exceptional and unique.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does an astounding job playing a troubled individual who's both frustrated with the world, yet destined to be great. He banters effortlessly with his main crew, which includes three other rough-and-tumble men, in a way that makes it easily believable they've known each other for years. His snarky attitude doesn't appear like an acting role when he's being interrogated by pesky interviewing- therapists. Matt's on screen relationship with his actual therapist (Robin Williams) demonstrates how hard it is to attain trust from someone who's been hurt before. The acting that takes place during a couple of the ""sessions"" is so believable and moving, my eyes started tearing up. <br/><br/>Known for being in lighter movies, Robin Williams not only takes on this serious role of Dr. Sean Maguire, but seems to relish it. His relationship with Professor Lambeau was one that happens on a daily basis in reality. One old friend will inevitably be more successful than the other, and the mixed emotions between them makes for an interesting subplot that adds to the movement of the entire movie. Their fight about Will's future was raw and emotional and touched the soul on many levels. <br/><br/>The true secret that makes this entire film more than just another forgettable movie, is the script. The story of Will Hunting is gloriously written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. It is honest, true, flawed, yet entirely and utterly human. The continuous string of swears and f-bombs that grace the dialogue of the rowdy group of men is perfect for beer drinking and friendly mocking between close friends. All of the arguments and fights in the movie have a ring of truth and honesty that every director and screenwriter strives for. <br/><br/>The movie in all it's entirety is just a beautiful story of hardwork, building trust, and following what you love. The camera angles, soft focus, and wonderful lighting add to the atmosphere. Throughout the entire film, there was a particular melody that popped up. The music was discordant, yet hopeful and persistent, and matched the theme of the movie. Matt Damon's character Will never thought much of himself or of what he could be, until Prof Lambeau took notice. The ending of the movie was predictable to a tee, but it ended so perfectly I wouldn't have it any other way. Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them."

","Highlight: Nominated for 9 Oscars and won two Oscars that includes Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams) and Best Screenplay (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) Good Will Hunting proved to be a rise to Stardom for Matt Damon<br/><br/>This is an intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT where he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department. Though the story is a bit far stretched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT. This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy. He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing. The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale. The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon delivering a fine performance which snagged him his only Oscar nomination till date. Minnie Driver, as Will's love interest, also landed out with an Oscar nomination. Robin Williams won his first Oscar for his role after three previous nominations. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly the under-appreciated Stellan Skarsg√•rd The story is interesting and quite entertaining .The comedy is done well and placed well throughout the film. I do have a complaint about the film that is the absurd amount of swearing in the film. I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film; it is a great film to watch. Overall, ""Good Will Hunting"", despite the incredibly precious title, is worthwhile a film. Fine performances and a compelling (Oscar-winning) script combine to produce a memorable film that should be fondly remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>My Rating - 8/10"

","The script for Good Will Hunting was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who both star in the movie. Damon plays the lead role of Will Hunting and Affleck plays his best friend, Chuckie Sullivan. The theme of the film is a focus on ideas, specifically the complexity of human relationships and social problems. It is surprisingly complex considering the age of the two young writers.<br/><br/>Will Hunting is a street-wise Boston kid whose childhood memories involve foster homes and abuse. His daily life involves cruising the streets, hanging out in the local bar and looking for fights. He is employed as a custodian at the prestigious M.I.T.<br/><br/>The audience is unaware of Will's photographic memory and genius status until he solves a mathematical problem on an M.I.T. hallway chalkboard that even the most respected M.I.T. professor cannot solve. Ultimately there are four people who try to save Will from his destructive life style. Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, Sean McGuire, played by Robin Williams, Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, and Chuckie Sullivan.<br/><br/>Upon realizing that the custodian solved the elusive mathematical equation, Lambeau reaches out to help Hunting. He agrees to intervene on behalf of the youth, promising a judge he will provide guidance and counseling in exchange for keeping Hunting from jail. After exhausting numerous counselors, Lambeau turns to college friend, Sean McGuire, to counsel Hunting. McGuire and Lambeau have their own complicated relationship stemming from their college days which resurfaces with their rekindled acquaintance.<br/><br/>McGuire begins to reach Hunting and seems to be making some progress. Hunting begins a relationship with Harvard student, Skylar, who also challenges him to open up and be honest about his past. As these relationships develop, Hunting can no longer hide from the intimacy that up until now he has so craftily dodged. As a result, when Skylar encourages Hunting to come to California with her, he breaks off the relationship.<br/><br/>Hunting refuses to make a career decision after multiple interviews with think tanks set up by Professor Lambeau. McGuire pushes Hunting during their next counseling session about what he wants to do with his life. When Hunting reverts to his old methods of dodging questions, McGuire tells him to leave.<br/><br/>Having now removed the individuals who were encouraging him to change his destructive pattern, Hunting returns to work with Chuckie on a construction site. At this point Chuckie becomes the fourth person to tell Hunting he had to take advantage of his gift. The outcome is predictable. Hunting returns to McGuire to mend their falling out and then heads off to find Skylar.<br/><br/>The camera work in this film was very well done and assists Director, Gus Van Sant, capture the complexity of the characters' relationships. One particular scene worth noting is a scene of McGuire and Hunting on a park bench by a pond. McGuire is opening up to Hunting about the loss of his wife and the love he had for her. This was the first session in which McGuire appears to crack Hunting's hard shell. The camera remained on the face of McGuire as he told his story. The camera does not move to incorporate Will until McGuire is done with his intimate sharing. All attention, including Hunting's, was focused on McGuire during his testimony.<br/><br/>A second piece of camera work captured Hunting allowing his protective walls to break down is a scene where he and Skylar are at a street caf√©. Their relationship has peaked at this point and one can clearly see they have fallen in love. The camera work completely focuses in on their faces, sharing an intimate moment with the audience.<br/><br/>This film gave both Williams and Damon the opportunity of a more challenging role. Each exceeded my expectation of their performance. Few films do this well in developing relationships although some might point to the film Beaches as another which successfully focuses on the complexity of relationships. This is a well written film only surpassed by its acting which is sure to please even the most critical movie-goer."

Although there is an important female character, it does not carry the story or is primarily responsible Matt's character's motivation.

The therapists are a stickier matter, as they all run screaming from his presence as he pinpoints their insecurities before they can pinpoint his--until he meets Sean Maguire (Robin Williams, unshaven like a bearcub), who brings all his DEAD POET'S philosophic skills to bear on the fast-talking, uncooperative scrapper.<br/><br/>Minnie Driver is Skylar, the Harvard student who falls for Hunting, but whom he ends up pushing away neurotically, in an argument-out-of-nowhere scene that is written so well, it doesn't seem like it was written at all, but escalating right before our eyes.<br/><br/>When Hunting's neurosis is unlocked by Maguire at the end, the revelation is so simple that we marvel at how easy it is to actually connect with someone, and yet how hard it is to find that connection.<br/><br/>The script benefits from being written by two ""unknowns"" who load it with verve and vitality, realism and dynamism, while still displaying a sound mechanical knowledge of ""Hollywood"" screenplay construction. Director and pal Kevin Smith aided Affleck and Damon in securing a deal where they had a large amount of control over their story, and director Gus Van Sant would let it play out unobtrusively and intelligently.<br/><br/>The Professor and Maguire are at odds on how to handle Hunting--push him into society or let him find it at his own pace; what could have become a clich√©d pissing contest in a pass√© Hollywood writer's hands remains a revelatory argument of ethics between two men who are battling their own regrets and just want the best for their surrogate son. If we thought we'd seen the best of Robin Williams in DEAD POET'S SOCIETY or AWAKENINGS (as opposed to his worst in NINE MONTHS or FATHER'S DAY), he embraces this sober psychiatrist's role like the bearcub embracing his face; and it took a couple of novices to put words in his mouth that would melt like butter and ring like the bells of Notre Dame. (He would deservedly walk away with a little gold man of his own for Best Supporting Actor.) <br/><br/>The best aspect of the script is that it truly captures the contempt and separation that a virtuoso feels for people who cannot grasp the art or discipline that he finds so awkwardly simple. Hunting describes his aptitude for equations with an insightful analogy: ""Beethoven looked at a piano and it just made sense to him; he could just play. I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals and a box of wood--but Beethoven, Mozart, they saw it, they could 'just play.' I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably couldn't hit the ball out of Fenway, and I can't play the piano. But when it came to stuff like that, I could always 'just play'."" <br/><br/>Hunting is offered jobs dealing with superstring theory, advanced algorithms, heavy duty CIA stuff, which he isn't interested in, at one point raging into a tirade that connects all the political corruption in the world to the personal level, ""...America only over there to install a government who would sell them oil at a good price..."" <br/><br/>Of course, the ""troubled character"" has to find his redemption and it is done subtly, with every payoff hitting elegantly: Hunting's best friend Chuckie (Affleck) laments Hunting is still hauling bricks with him, and hopes for the day he can arrive to pick up Hunting for work and Hunting is not there, ""...and you're just gone, no goodbyes, no nothing""; Maguire tells Hunting of how he met his wife by giving up a classic baseball game, ""I told my friends, 'I'm going to see about a girl'."" When these moments hit, the performances sell them; they are not forced, and create magnificent screen moments for Williams, Affleck and Damon.<br/><br/>We wish Affleck and Damon could once again write something half as good as this masterpiece of cerebral mayhem. Though they've parlayed their grand win into continued success through the years, nothing they've done individually or together yet matches the raw (dare we call it ""indie"") flavor-blast of GOOD WILL HUNTING. Like Costner, Welles and Lucas, they seem to have peaked at the head of their careers. It's ironic that these two young guys (Affleck and Damon), now renowned for their sex symbol status, shot themselves into the A-List by writing and starring in a dialog-driven mindfest! <br/><br/>--Poffy The Cucumber"

","I actually did enjoy this movie very much although it was a bit slow. I was intrigued by the character, Will Hunting which was well played by Matt Damon. I wanted to find out why he was a troublemaker, why he was scared and every other thing. It was just a good film with a good storyline and an interesting ending.<br/><br/>The favourite character choice was a tie between Will Hunting and Sean Maguire played by Matt Damon and Robin Williams respectively. Will Hunting was the main character in the film and the storyline revolved around helping him. It would have been very hard to script Hunting's dialogue as you would have to show him as a very smart man and it was successful as he fired off very detailed negative reasons why he wouldn't do something and it showed who he was and what kind of childhood he had. Hunting was just a man who had a troubled life and didn't know what to do with his enormous talent and needed the guidance of a mature man. This character was one of the most interesting characters that I have watched.<br/><br/>I would recommend to mature people who want to watch a unique movie and will be able to understand the whole purpose of this film.<br/><br/>This was a creative film that I really enjoyed, It had an all-star cast with Williams, Damon and Affleck and they didn't let me down. The storyline was a unique one and it wasn't exposed to quickly but took it's time which allowed the audience to really let each scene saturate in their mind for a moment longer and it all added to the great film it was."

","I have watched this movie possibly 30 times. Whenever it is on cable I will sit and watch and even finish the lines for some of the characters. I know I am probably bias because of the career path I have chosen (that being a therapist), but this is one of the best movies ever put out in all aspects. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon make their screen writing debut as well as play the lead roles. Damon is so believable as ""Will Hunting"" that you can't help to feel as though you know him. Another star of this film is Robin Williams who plays ""Sean McGuire"" the battle scarred therapist that is willing to do anything to help Will find his way through life.<br/><br/>In this film, Will Hunting is a genius who has been dealt the worse hand ever, and he tries to forget his past, when a professor at MIT decides to help him and give him a fighting chance. Ben Affleck who plays Will's best friend ""Chuckie"" who is just like family to Will and wants nothing more than to see him succeed. The movie is shot on location in South Boston and you are able to see all the grit and grime of this area as well as the ""better side of town"" when Will meets a girl from Harvard. The girl he meets ""Skylar"" played by Minnie Driver becomes a climactic character in the story. The soundtrack is amazing with one of the best being the 70's hit ""Afternoon Delight"". It sets the mood in all scenes and is able to show you all different perspectives.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone. It does have some adult situations but I had no problem watching this with my teenage daughter. It is a film that makes you really think about what is important and to live out your dreams. I know I will watch it again and again."
"alerickson15","Null","1","3","22 September 2011"," Good Will Hunting
","At first glance, Good Will Hunting in its title alone does not lure anyone into grabbing this DVD off the Blockbuster shelf. But once rented, the pleasure was all mine. Filled with the humor of Ben Affleck, intensity of Robin Williams and mystery of Matt Damon the nine out of ten stars basically rolls right off my tongue. Picture the drama of a tear filled chick-flick combined with the raw brash fight scenes of a Bruce Willis action thriller all while kicking back with microwave popcorn and can of coke¬Öpriceless, minus the popcorn and coke! This movie is Affleck and Damon's break out moment. The movie, set in the gritty streets of South Boston, finds its irony in Matt Damon's character, Will Hunting, an unusual 21 year- old math prodigy holding a job as a janitor at the prestigious MIT. Although a bit far-fetched, the cast is perfection in leaving one to wonder why no one dreams to be a janitor. Why can't that be fulfilling enough?<br/><br/>Moving on to junior mints, everyone will relate to the simple story line. Ben Affleck's chain smoking, beer drinking character Chuckie, tries to persuade Will toward a better life. Of course, don't we all have a friend like that? Will has a way off the streets that have hurt him, but loyalty is hard to leave. When Will's abusive past continues to haunt his future, enters Sean (Robin Williams) as his new therapist. From here on in the battle is waged whether Will's life of work and bar brawls with friends is the happy ending of his story. Ah, a breath of fresh air and a far cry from our open era of self-induced reality stardom and athletic phenoms, finding success only in the money they spend. It brings to life what makes any of us tick. What keeps us from staying safely where we are and what pushes us to dream?<br/><br/>Renting now is a no brainer since these names today would fill theater seats on star power alone¬Ödo take into account no one had heard of Affleck or Damon when it hit the big screen. Robin Williams surprises straying from his in your face stand-up comedy to play a therapist who maybe hasn't quite reached his potential. And expect him to have to take a long hard look at his own life. Insert dramatic music and play in slow motion-not that sappy.<br/><br/>My infatuation with the movie stops short as I take one star from my count due to the made for Hollywood ending. The film is inspirational, witty and smart¬Öuntil the ending. I understand that the grand finale sells tickets and the audience appreciates certain outcomes but no need to dumb down what is central to the story as reality begs for loose ends or bad choices or death or something. No one's life is neat and tidy and Will Hunting along with the rest of the cast could conceivably be in rehab for a very long time. I was not ready to say The End and think happily ever after. <br/><br/>Good Will Hunting¬Ösurprisingly not about hunting at all. I hesitate to push people to see a film held in such high regards, but it carries itself with a simple charm that allows a deep story to be told. The acting is top notch with the characters believable. Fix the ending and we can run down the beach with Bo Derek in the pursuit of that perfect 10!"
"pfgpowell-1","7","1","3","6 July 2011"," A slight glibness is easily forgotten in what is often a moving film
","Here again is a film to which an extraordinary number of IMDb reviewers react with either jubilant enthusiasm as though it heralded the Second Coming or utter disdain as though all involved should be lined up against the nearest wall and shot. And neither reaction says anything at all useful about the film (or any other these others which elicit the same kind of response) but merely indicates yet again that a sense of proportion seems to elude a frightening number of people. Perhaps I am being too much of the buttoned-up Brit, but such extremes do nothing but gradually and surely devalue the credibility of contributors. In this reviewer's humble opinion Good Will Hunting has one or two forgivable flaws, but is overall an entertaining success. I suppose almost everyone here will know that back story of how two childhood friends and aspiring actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, were so fed up with getting nothing but bit gigs that they decided to write their own screenplay. In fact, their determination was such that once their agent had finally managed to find a buyer, they turned him down when they realised they would not have the degree of control over the production they wanted. And judging by what was finally made, they were right to hold out as they did. It would be easier to list what I regard as the few flaws first as they are minor and can be easily overlooked in what is otherwise an entertaining and often moving story. Damon is the tearaway from South Boston who is ‚Äî this we have to accept as no proof is given ‚Äî a mathematical genius with a photographic memory but who as an orphan who was regularly beaten by his stepfather finds it impossible to let go and allow someone to get close, in short who has a lamentably low self-esteem. Affleck is one of three childhood buddies with whom Damon likes nothing better than hanging out, getting drunk and getting into trouble with the police. Then there is Stellan Skarsgard as an MIT mathematics professor who discovers Damon's gift and tries to help him, in the process enlisting a college friend, Robin Williams's counsellor who can relate to Damon in that he has never been able to come to terms with the death from cancer of his wife several years earlier. The story is, in fact, quite simple: Williams does, in fact, finally manage to break through Damon's shell and Damon comes good. My slight gripe is that is is all a little glib, a little easy, a little like a textbook. In the real world the Damon character might be expected to be far more of a loner and far less sociable than he is portrayed. And Williams's success in getting through to Damon seems to encounter no setbacks ‚Äî well, one ever so slight one ‚Äî before Damon is 'healed' and takes off to claim the love of a good woman who also tried to help him. Given how entertaining the film is and, as I say, even quite moving, my gripes are perhaps a little harsh, for there is a great deal which is outstanding. Even though Damon and Affleck wrote the script, this is in no way a vanity project and it feel more like an ensemble production than anything else. Damon makes his character likable and sympathetic, and you root for him to come good (as, this being Hollywood, you always know he will). Williams shows once again that beneath the manic clown is a rather good actor (he was especially good with Al Pacino in the remake of Insomnia), and he, too, convinces as the psychologist (I think) who gains as much from his encounter with Damon as Damon does. Good Will Hunting is more than credible and the subsequent success of Damon and Affleck (and Casey Affleck, Ben's brother who plays another of the gang) shows this was no flash in the pan. From me it gets a seven."

They may also know that both are regular stars or cameos in Kevin Smith movies.<br/><br/>What they may not know is that whilst still in their mid-twenties they wrote and produced one of the best 'finding yourself' movies of our generation.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is the story of Will Hunting (Damon) dredging through life as a standard no-hoper working a labouring day job and janitoring at a top university at nights. Aside from his jobs he regularly lands in trouble and generally burns through life with an attitude, to his best friend (Afleck)'s dismay. What his friend knows is that Will is brilliant, he has the mind of a prodigy.<br/><br/>Will could do anything or be anyone he wants but feels most at home without responsibilities, it's the duty of his friends, his girlfriend (Minnie Driver) and a burned out psychologist (played exceptionally by Robin Williams) that have to 'kick him in the ass' so to speak.<br/><br/>This film blew me away, and when I discovered later that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck wrote it I garnered an entire new respect for both."

He appears to be a genius in science which is discovered by an intelligent professor. He tries to guide and let Will bloom with the talents he has, along with the assistance of another professor and shrink Sean (Robin Williams), who has some problems of his own. The scenery of the movie in my view is simple and not diverse, but the story of the movie is so strong it is not a problem at all, it will keep you tight to the screen for the duration of the movie.<br/><br/>The way Will's relationship with Skylar is waved into the movie is perfect.

","Everyone raved about 'Good Will Hunting' when it came out. At the time all I could do was roll my eyes and say, ""Cmon. A movie written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yuck!"". I finally got around to seeing it about a week ago, and I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised. 'Good Will Hunting' isn't a great Oscar-worthy movie most critics pointed it out to be, but just a very good film with some good acting performances. Matt Damon in his finest acting performance yet plays Will. Will is considered a hoodlum by some and hangs out with his buddies led by Chuckie (Ben Affleck in a so-so performance, which is very good for him). They screw around, get drunk and beat people up -- they are real 'nothings' to society. But, Will has a secret -- he's a genius. He works as a janitor at Harvard University and one day solves a ""said-to-be"" impossible math problem put up by the brilliant Math professor (played by Stellan Skarsgaard in a strong performance). Will then becomes the math professor's new hero and is destined for greatness, but will Will abandon his friends to better his own life? Robin Williams steals the show in an electrifying performance as Will's psychiatrist and Minnie Driver provides good acting as Will's British Harvard girlfriend. Gus Van Sant's directing is fair and the writing is pretty solid for the most part (but nothing Academy Award worthy). The bottom line is that 'Good Will Hunting' is a very good film where the good points more then out-weigh the bad points, but it's nothing spectacular. I recommend it. Grade: B"
"engage2","Null","1","3","13 September 2003"," Here I have explained the underlying ideas behind the movie (SPOILERS).
","This movie, like many others, has one or two characteristics that are quite questionable, but at the same time understandable. One of which is the possible impression that Hollywood intended to sell themselves to the general audience by taking the idea of a genius who does the unbelievable act of being cool... ""Oh my, look at that! He's just as smart as Steve Urkel (another fictional genius) but he is like, so cool."" If that was your take on the movie why should it be? This is where you went wrong, you compared Will Hunting to some stereotypical view of the genius. Does Will Hunting set a good example? Definitely not! He is a gigantic loser, but the message behind the movie is simple: ""No matter who you are or how intelligent, we always need to look to our fellow human beings (i.e. each other) for wisdom and guidance."" The movie is incredibly accurate in demonstrating how it is very possible for a genius of any caliber to lack wisdom. The movie is also heart-warming and easily delivers bundles of ""goodness"". Look at the way the movie concludes itself... with Robin Williams reading Will's letter saying,<br/><br/>""Dear Shawn,<br/><br/>If the professor calls about that job,<br/><br/>tell him sorry,<br/><br/>I had to go see about a girl,<br/><br/>Will.""<br/><br/>Shawn looks up again, ""Son of a bitch... he stole my line...""<br/><br/>Scene changes to an empty highway with a beat-up old car driving on and on, inside steers Will, one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever seen, and although he has not quite gotten anywhere great in life, all the helping hands and friendships paid off, and there he is on his way to something better...<br/><br/>The genius is the closest any human being can get to determining actions and decisions almost always without flaw, this movie united the genius with the unfortunate human beings you might see on the sidewalk when you take a stroll downtown.<br/><br/>You can see how during the middle, before the climax of Will losing his ability to keep things inside, that one by one he loses those people who are his world and yet one by one, he shrugs off any care he has for each loss. First, Skylar, then, the Professor, then Chuckie (not really loses) who tells him basically, ""I don't really want you to be around..."" this comes as a shock to Will, since he always though that if he loses someone new in his life, like Skylar, he can always fall back on his best friend...and then finally Shawn, who gives Will the idea that he had enough of his 'shit' because Will spoke to Shawn with very little respect after everyone else who was important dropped from his life as if like flies. ""Look at me Shawn, what the hell is the point? I lost everyone important to me, all of our sessions were a waste anyway, I might as well show you that I'm nobody you should be trying to help, so I'll test you to...""<br/><br/>I think my explanation in the ""A Beautiful Mind"" forum would help you understand what makes one genius behave a certain way, and another almost the complete opposite. I mean Will Hunting is on the opposite end of the personality pole to John Nash (a non-fictional genius) and Steve Urkel."

As I watched the film I honestly enjoyed it and found it credibly done, but as I came away, I had a lingering sense that I had been duped. This movie is not worth all the hoopla (and awards) it garnered, something I can only attribute to Ben and Matt's 'fresh' faces.

","Good Will Hunting is a movie which you don't need to be a genius to understand, you just have to be awake. It is a continually rewarding movie which offers something new each time you see it. A natural reaction the first time one sees Good Will Hunting is to focus on the story of Will, his mathematical genius and his past experience with people. Then the next time you start to realize that they don't overly stress the genius aspect, but simply use it as a way of him to become ""something."" Then you get the conflict between Skaarsgard and Williams about which destiny is best for Will, obviously stretching from some long-standing problems between them. And there's infinitely more. Damon and Affleck both cared very much about what they put into their screenplay, and it shows. If you don't care, then no matter how many special effect you can pour into it, it will never be as good as a movie that you pour yourself into. That is the difference between this movie and so many sub-par excuses."

","Just once I would like to see Hollywood portray the relationship between therapist/counsellor (Robin Williams here) and client (Matt Damon) in some way that is approximately like the real thing. It is NOT normal for counsellors to have sex with their clients (as in most British dramas involving therapy) or for the therapist to physically attack their client, as here. And then in the next scene their relationship is 'back to normal.'<br/><br/>This is a serious issue because inaccurate portrayals put people off from going to therapy; therapy that could really help them.<br/><br/>So, the acting is fine and the plot is interesting, but I guess I am just too close to the topic of counselling and psychotherapy to be able to enjoy a movie that portrays that so badly."

","Well acted and written film.  However, it follows in a long tradition in Western culture of romanticizing white-trash.  The recipe is usually the same.  Take a working class loser, make him very handsome, brave, charming, and extremely intelligent, then contrast him against well educated people who are shown to be sexually frustrated, neurotic, and otherwise unhappy, and you create a white-trash hero.  ""Good Will Hunting"" plays this game very effectively.  By the end of the film it has you believing the classic lie that education is unnecessary and all that matters in life is that you get the girl.  Still, a good film at what it tries to do.  However, one should watch an episode of Jerry Springer after seeing this film to remember what uneducated white-trash are really like."

","Good Will Hunting is the film that was unlucky to have been made in the same year as Titanic. Sadly while Titanic left with 13, it left Good Will Hunting with only 2, and unfairly so. For while no one denies that Titanic was impressive enough, Good Will Hunting should have left with the credit it deserved. This combination of Gus Van Sant's direction and the divine writing of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was one of the best films that I have ever seen. You are greeted with Will Hunting, a sadly disturbed guy who has the most amazing mind, yet can not make himself take advantage of this gift because he is afraid of the consequences. The film looks stunning, with excellent use of camera angles, while the relationships between the various characters develop with so much sincerity that you can really empathise with them. The stars of the piece are not Damon and Affleck however, but Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard, as the shrink who is able to get into the head of brilliant young Hunting and the genius maths professor who discovers Hunting and then spends the rest of the film wishing that he hadn't. The casting of Robin Williams in the serious role of Sean Maguire is excellent; after all Williams often performs his best work when allowed to take off the comic mask that he is so well known for. There is little I can find to criticise this movie with, sometimes the music fails to live up to what it could, but that is just nit-picking! When I saw this, I had already seen Titanic and after, I went to see Titanic again. It was then that I realised that the main element of the film that was any good was the actual sinking of the ship, and that the other two and a half hours were merely there to keep you going to build you up to the ship sinking. If you are looking for a movie to show the development of a relationship between two people, watch Good Will Hunting. Good Will Hunting gives you the hope that things can work out in the end. Also if you have the option, I urge you to listen to the audio commentary that you can get on the DVD, and see how things developed during the making of this utterly superb film."

Robin Williams plays the psychiatrist that tries to get to the bottom of Will's problems.  Will is so intelligent that in the discussions with the psychiatrist it is more often the psychiatrist's life that is put in question.

"Rupert__Pupkin","10","2","10","2 December 2004"," To all the morons who didn't like this movie
","I've read several complaints by people who didn't like this movie, and they all say the same thing (i.e. no one can be that smart, how did Will have time to read all those books?, even geniuses have to get some formal education, how was he an expert on everything?, etc. etc. etc.).<br/><br/>Newsflash folks: Will was a genius of unusual magnitude. Yes, it's extremely unlikely for someone to be that smart, but it's possible. So stop complaining about the basic premise of the movie and just accept it.<br/><br/>And what a dumb thing to complain about. That's like me saying that Ghostbusters is a dumb movie because ghosts don't really exist and you can't catch them with special guns. It's fiction folks. Just accept it and enjoy the movie."

","This is one of the most powerful and pertinent movies of my generation's time. Matt Damon's portrayal of an abused kid growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in foster care is a most accurate depiction of the consequences of our broken society. The representation of abuse is painfully on target and the intensity of Will's intelligence and his perspective on that pain is enough to bring the viewer to tears. I have seen this movie probably 30 times and every time it still captures the same feeling within me, a feeling of motivation, of activation to intervene in the lives of real kids that exist in a world just like Will Hunting's."

","To start off, I would highly recommend this to any viewers 16 and older who are mature enough to understand the beauty of the film. This Oscar award winning film so full of emotion you feel as if you are right in the story feeling what Will feels. When Will proves the equation on the board, the momentum begins to pick up. Soon after proving he is a genius, he shows that he is also a brute, and a lover. He can take on hooligans as well as keep a girlfriend. The movie shows how Will and Mr Lambeau begin to connect through their mathematical triumph, but the professors spot in the boys heart quickly fades as he meets a therapist he cannot best. Robin Williams plays Sean Maguire, a run down psychologist working at a community college. He teaches Will many lessons through the pain of his wife's death. He explains how his brain does not allow him to comprehend true emotional responses in situation, he knows them, but does not feel them. The movie is really all about the transformation of this Albert Einstein boy played by Matt Damon from a bum to a functioning member of society. The actors play their roles perfectly and are made for these roles. This movie allows us to see parts of ourselves reflected in Will, and almost brings you to tears when Will breaks down. Flawless movie except for all the cursing to make it R seemed very unnecessary and out of context, otherwise beautiful execution."

","Good Will Hunting (1997): Dir: Gus Van Sant / Cast: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, Stellan Scarsgard, Ben Affleck: Compelling drama about someone on the wrong side of the track. Will Hunting is a janitor at the institution of technology and he has a photographic memory. He is discovered solving mathematics problems that students fail to solve. His boozing and fighting land him in jail until he is bailed out by a professor who wishes to use his talent. He is set up with numerous therapists whom he makes fools out of until he is met with one who refuses to turn away. Good screenplay only falters with repetition but it is a superb achievement by Gus Van Sant. He previously made such intriguing films as Drugstore Cowboy and To Die For. Matt Damon is excellent as Hunting whose attitude buries nasty scars that predictably arise from his past. Robin Williams counters repetition by delivering one of his best performances as the psychiatrist who utters those powerful lines, ""It's not your fault."" Minnie Driver is Hunting's girlfriend who is a student but also cares enough to endure his pain until she cannot anymore. Stellan Scarsgard as the professor introduces the plot and receives hard facts. Ben Affleck plays Damon's friend on the wrong side of the track who will advice Will Hunting to travel the right road. It is a great film about coming to terms with yourself and your past. Score: 9 / 10"

Will's impeccable ability to calculate with his amazing mathematical abilities is the ticket he's sitting on and not cashing in. Will not being in his slightest interest of math is so comparable with how realistic people are today. Will's perceptions from his friends, and shrink have him going where his heart desires all along. <br/><br/>The true test of his might is truly what he wants, there was a relative feeling in him that we all feel of being in a familiar setting, but not knowing where to go, what to do. <br/><br/>This is a movie to grow up to, find new understanding and can put an impressionable guilt in someones mind. The soundtrack from Elliot Smith is the icing on the cake and translates so transparently on the day to day life that Will Hunting lives. Good Will Hunting, a must watch!"
"lkfricke","8","1","4","23 February 2016"," Good Will Hunting is about a hotheaded genius and his struggle to reach his potential.
","Gus Van Sant's classic movie, Good Will Hunting, portrays the multi-faceted dynamic of the human soul. Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a lowly janitor at MIT. However, his abilities far surpass his position. While cleaning the the math rooms after class hours, Will stops to solve a difficult problem that a professor had posted on his white board. Within minutes the problem is solved and staff and students alike are baffled. Once his genius is realized, the professor aims to mentor and facilitate him in order for Will to reach his full potential. The problem, however, is that Will has created walls that are nearly impossible to break down. These walls prevent him from fully connecting with those in his life, something we see through the actor's guiltless and nonchalant toying with the emotions and authority of others. After getting in a fist fight over an old feud, he is required to see a therapist once a week to stay out of jail. ¬†His therapist Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams, allows us to see Will's complexity of character. During their sessions, Will's jabs and banter only furthers Sean's desire to break down his barriers. It is Will's physical and verbal defenses to Maguire's gentle probing that show how deeply his problems run. As their sessions progress, the doctor-patient relationship quickly turns into a strong and mutual friendship, and we can see the characters grow and develop through their interactions. Throughout the movie, Damon perfectly plays the wounded genius who has been knocked down one too many times, covering up his hurt with sarcasm and quickly delivered wit. Damon's delivery and mannerisms progress the character... His air of mental superiority and disdain for following authority can easily be seen. The flippant way in which Damon treats others and their emotions helps to bring to light his own character flaws. Similar to Damon, Williams does a wonderful job at showing his character's broken heart and carefully controlled despair. He is haunted by his past, and that is apparent through his acting. In moments where a touchy subject is brought to light, Williams lashes out both physically and verbally. This aggression is contrasted greatly by his usually calm and caring demeanor. Williams makes this switch seamlessly, making his character's pain believable. The script fosters the relationship of the two men, showcasing the benefits that each receives from it. In viewing Good Will Hunting, it is obvious that the scriptwriters know a great deal about the human complexity, brought greatly into play in a scene when Maguire attempts to convince Will that what happened in the past was not his fault. Each character seems to struggle with their sense of self, and we see a general fear of stepping out of the comfort zone. While these issues are covered in the script, the delivery is fast paced and keeps us interested and thoroughly entertained throughout. There are many one-liners sprinkled into heavy conversations to add comic relief, as well as helping the script stay true to the characters themselves. In a world filled with clich√© movies that all seem much the same, Good Will Hunting stands out from the masses. It showcases incredible acting and a dynamic script that forces us to reflect upon our own lives. Watching this movie makes one introspectively assess one's own character flaws, much like Will, and inspires one to do something about them."
"bsbulldogs","10","1","4","10 December 2015"," Inspiring and uplifting
","I have watched this film about three or four times now, including twice this year and it has grown on me since I first watched it. If there is one word I could use to describe this film, it is inspiring. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a janitor who works at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is a self taught genius who has no formal education. He also doesn't know what to do with his ability. Enter Dr Sean Maguire (Robin Williams in his career best role), a therapist that helps Will try to make the most of his abilities. The chemistry between Damon and Williams is electric and plays a big part in making this movie magnificent. Very effective portrayal of a therapist-patient relationship. Besides the two leads, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skargard provide great support. Besides their acting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve just as much credit for their Oscar winning screenplay as the story is uplifting. This film was a bit stiff not to win Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor-Matt Damon but did get it right with Robin Williams winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in a truly touching performance."
"everha","8","1","4","29 October 2015"," A journey to acceptance
","Matt Damon as Will Hunting is a troubled young man with an incredible gift for mathematics. As he makes his way from boyhood to manhood he continues to struggle with the issue of his parents' abandonment and his foster-family's abuse. This tale chronicles his journey to accepting himself, his gifts and love from others.<br/><br/>Along on the journey with Will Hunting are his three best friends Chuckie Sullivan played by Ben Affleck, Morgan O'Mally played by Casey Affleck and Billy McBride played by Cole Hauser. Will refer to these three as his brothers. After meeting his love interest Skylar, played by Minnie Driver, Will mentions twelve such brothers.<br/><br/>Will's violent childhood helped him develop a tendency for violence hence his frequent jail stays. When Professor Gerald Lambeau, played by Stellan Skargard, discovers Will's genius, he brokers a deal with Will and the judicial court to council and develop Will's talent and keep him out of trouble. As part of the deal, Will must agree to see a counselor once a week. After many failed attempts, Gerald settled on Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. These characters are expertly played. They feel like real people.<br/><br/>Will's journey begins in a very small town in Boston, Massachusetts. His world his small, his impact upon it is big. The prevailing theme of Good Will Hunting is acceptance. Will is very much not accepted by the very people that are supposed to nurture and protect him. Will is rejected by his parents, his abusive foster parents and court system.<br/><br/>Running not so silently yet parallel to the theme of acceptance is the struggles of everyone in Will's life. Counselor Sean Maguire is struggling to put the pieces of his life back together since his wife died of cancer two years ago. Sean's first meeting with Will in his office lays bare the wounds he is struggling with healing. Will notices a painting that Sean created hanging on the wall and suggest that his choice of color reveals that he is just shy of cutting off his ear like the tragic painter Vincent Van Gogh. Will continues to dig at Sean and suggests that his wife left him. This reference to Sean's wife touched a nerve and elicited a violent reaction towards Will. This scene is an excellent example of using the close-up to create drama and tension. Clearly the acceptance of and struggle with the death of his wife of 16 years is not under control for Sean. Will suggestion of abandonment by Sean's wife is akin to the abandonment he felt as a child along with Sean's violence are two things that Will is familiar with. They are a familiar comfort to him.<br/><br/>Professor Lambeau's desire to cultivate in Will that potential for greatness he sees leaves him struggling with the past. Professor Lambeau was discovered 20 years ago by the think-tank at M.I.T. Yet in that time he has failed to distinguish himself among the greats. Determined to do more for Will, he pushes Will to strive for more. The professor wants Will to immerse himself in the academic life at M.I.T, collaborate with other professors to solve complex problems that have eluded them for years and to pursue employment with the most prestigious firms in the world. Will pushed back and rejects Professor Lambeau's efforts as he is not ready to accept his gifts or the fact that someone else could really care enough about him to see him succeed in life. Will's sabotage of his opportunities are so profound that Professor Lambeau's confesses that he wished he had never met Will. The idea that Will would actually squander his genius and throw away is future sickens Professor Lambeau. It leads him to question his own career at M.I.T. This forced rejection by Professor Lambeau is what Will has come to expect in his life. So much so, if he is not rejected, he will cause rejection. This is a familiar comfort to him.<br/><br/>The main thematic idea of acceptance and the subordinate theme of struggle is also prevalent in the film Chocolate. The main character Vianne Rocher wants to be accepted by the people of a small town in France.<br/><br/>Like the setting for Good Will Hunting, Chocolat is set in a very small town where Vianne has a very big impact. She too has an unusual talent for making decadent chocolate treat and wants other to share in her passion for the art. However, Vianne struggles against the moral code of tranquility and abstinence from all things pleasurable of the people. Vianne's need for acceptance is also running counter to her constant need to roam. The life of a free soul, instilled into her by her mother's free spirit, pits her against herself, the townspeople and her talent as a chocolatier. As Vianne's overtures to bring indulgent pleasure to the townspeople are rejected, she prepares to leave that town and roam even more. This rejection and need to run is a familiar comfort to Vianne."

The premise of this film sees this incredibly smart janitor at MIT who goes to therapist to try and fulfill his potential. This was one of matt Damon's first lead performances and he is brilliant in this film. He was a great character that you want to root for even though he clearly has his issues. He was an incredibly interesting character that is one of Damon's best. The best performance in this film is that of the late robin Williams. He was such a great character as you see him and Damon interact in these sessions and it is some of the best chemistry I have ever seen in a film with some very memorable lines. Ben affleck really works as Damon's best friend and I really liked their chemistry in this film. Winona Ryder is great as Damon's girlfriend and their relationship really worked in this film. Stellan skarssgard is the professor trying to get the best out of Damon and I thought he was a very interesting character in this film that provided an opposite to Williams. The story was really good especially with Damon and all the relationships he encounters in the film especially Williams. It is fascinating seeing the mentality of will as he goes through this journey in the film. The script is great with some truly funny dialogue and some great drama. The style of the dismal setting works for this film. However, the only problem with this film is that of the pacing of the film as it can drag a little bit. Overall though this is a fantastic film that deserves all its praise."

","Gus Van Sant brings a dramatic, emotional filled, inspiring, movie to theaters. We see familiar actors that we have seen in a lot of great movies. Matt Damon stars as Will Hunting, a janitor at M.I.T who has gift for mathematics but has a big record for crimes he as done. After many run-ins with the law there is only one person who can help him: a psychology professor ( Robin Williams) who may be able to turn his life around. This film was very emotional to me. It has a great plot and great script and many turning points throughout the movie. Van Sant used actors that were good to his taste and had many years of experience with acting and were great with their roles: Matt Damon's character was very dramatic and emotional throughout the movie and the hardships he faces. Robin Williams played his role really good that I felt it was just perfect as he explains to Will that deep down in him there is good inside while Ben Affleck and Minnie Drive were great too- both played good in their roles and probably liked Van Sant's way of directing. During a number of scenes it was sort of hard to follow what was happening but as I kept watching I understood how connected the characters were together and the strong chemistry they had. Overall the film is very creative, emotional, and dramatic and worth watching numerous times. This movie shows how deep down this is good in every person."
"a_kamini","10","1","4","16 June 2015"," Good Will Hunting
","The winner of Project Greenlight, ""Good Will Hunting"" to me deserved to win every award that there was giving in 1997. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did an amazing job depicting the want to be good enough to move on with ""will"" a metaphor established for the main character ""Will"" as he journeys from his innermost want to a real goal in society. The story journeys with Will as he battles his own demons for a chance to express himself in smarts. The movie explores the differences in classes in society in Boston but really stood as a metaphor not just for that difference in society, but of gender, status and affiliation as well. Themes that came up were ""boys will be boys"", ""I am the King of my own mansion"", ""where there's 'will', there's a way"" and ""dreams, they do come true""."
"estebangonzalez10","10","1","4","11 June 2015"," Robin Williams best performance thanks to an incredibly solid script.
","""I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you.""<br/><br/>The scene where Robin Williams' Sean Maguire sits on a park bench with Matt Damon's Will Hunting to have their little shrink session about life, love, and identity is perhaps my favorite cinematic moment ever. More than a conversation, it is a monologue that Robin Williams delivers with incredible passion and it gives me goosebumps every time I watch this scene. It's the reason why he won an Academy Award for best supporting actor and why the film works as well as it does. This is just one fantastic moment, but I can think of many more scenes that left me completely in love with the movie. Like the scene where Sean Maguire and Stellan Skarsgard's Prof. Lambeau have their long awaited discussion about ego and missed opportunities (""You think I'm a failure. I know who I am, and I'm proud of what I do. I was a conscientious choice, I didn't ef up! And you and your cronies think I'm some sort of pity case. You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around going, ""The Fields Medal! The Fields Medal!"" Why are you still so efin' afraid of failure?""), the scene where Sean narrates Game 6 of the World Series to Will, which he passed on for the opportunity to meet his future wife (I just slid my ticket across the table, and I said, ""Sorry, guys; I gotta see about a girl.""), and of course the final scene between Will And Sean which I don't want to spoil. There are just so many great moments in this film thanks to the strong performances and the amazing screenplay from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck which is one of my favorites. Even the scenes between Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and between Damon and Minnie Driver are incredible and I still have to leave them out of my top five favorite scenes in this movie because there are just so many. And I even left out Will's amazing monologue about why he shouldn't work for the N.S.A. It's simply one of the best written movies ever and it has Robin Williams best performance (that is saying a lot considering how much I loved his work in Dead Poet's Society, Good Morning Vietnam, and The Fisher King). <br/><br/>""You're not perfect, sport, and let me save you the suspense: this girl you've met, she's not perfect either. But the question is whether or not you're perfect for each other."" <br/><br/>I don't know if Good Will Hunting is a perfect film, but I know it is perfect for me and for that reason it will always be included as one of my all time favorite films up there with The Sixth Sense and The Dark Knight. I have plenty of other favorites which I sometimes include in my top ten, but those three are always at the very top of my list, and I don't even worry about having to discuss it with anyone else."
"Wombat_Had_That","9","1","4","6 May 2015"," Wonderful vehicle for every actor involved
","Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully paced, highly engaging drama that focuses on each character with painful emotional authenticity. I mean, literally, painful. The human struggles facing Matt Damon and Robin Williams' characters are so universal and beautifully realized. Every man must face one of their points of view, at some point. The hurt that Robin portrays is touching, sad and moving. You never see his wife. He just reminisces of her and it couldn't have felt more real. The subtleties in Robin's performance in this film are breathtaking as he laughs, cries and has his patience pushed over the edge.<br/><br/>I really cannot imagine a better filmmaker to direct this picture than Gus van Sant. The way in which he portrays the troubled gifted young man, Will Hunting, cannot only be seen in this film, but in Elephant, as well. His ability to direct young talent is seen in the handling of Matt Damon as a new actor; the fearlessness with which he tackled demanding emotional close-ups and expressive subtlety is remarkable. The plot setup is traditional, yet flawless, with a slow reveal of more dense emotional conflicts in an eventual, memorable series of climactic peaks involving Will's closest acquaintances.<br/><br/>Structurally, I do not think Good Will Hunting breaks any new ground. That is fine. If you are expecting a new type of storytelling or narrative formula, don't.<br/><br/>Any lack of narrative experimentation is completely overshadowed by the powerful performances provided by every single cast member, except for Ben Affleck. Nothing personal, I actually like him, but, in this film, he is still clearly a new actor with potential to be achieved. He undoubtedly holds the reigns on one of the single most emotionally charged moments of the film, but, just doesn't shine in my opinion. Affleck is perfectly likable and I would say he was well cast - I don't think his chops were quite on Damon's level yet, though, which only became obvious in the latter half of the film.<br/><br/>The tension of everyone's intellect crashing together is a real treat. Typically, this kind of heightened drama is based on violence or stunts, but, the way Good Will Hunting carries its highly taut narrative is through the intellectual conflicts amongst some very smart characters, not through empty spectacle. It was nice to see the love interest as a highly educated equal to the male lead and not a damsel-in-distress. She challenges Will emotionally and intellectually, something he is not used to in his even closest of relationships. You can understand everyone's point of view whether you disagree with them or not.<br/><br/>Damon, Williams, and Skarsgard's roles are highly charged and particularly well executed. They all deserve major recognition for their acting talent in this film."
"CinematicInceptions","9","1","4","21 January 2015"," Lots of emotion presented in a realistic way, though with a slightly weaker story.
","Although this movie is slightly lacking in its storyline, this is overshadowed by its realism (or realisticness, whichever you prefer). I think people expect it to be a good story with people doing rather extraordinary things in context of an ordinary life. You could argue that the people in this movie are intellectually exceptional and that it is almost impossible for them to do anything ordinary, making my point from above incorrect. However, I think that Will's actions at the end prove that he leads an ordinary life. His conflict is one that everybody faces in one way or another at some point. He has the ability to work in an important job and be rich and famous for his mathematical abilities. However, he feels like following that path isn't worth his time as he states very clearly in his run-on about why he shouldn't join the NSA. My feeling is that he thinks he won't be good at a job like that because his heart won't be in it. At my high-school it seems like there are lots of higher achieving students who all say they either want to study law or medicine or something like that. While those are important and high-paying fields, I doubt that all of them are interested in that. This does not apply to everyone in that position of course, but it holds true for Will, as we see Lambeau try to push him and make him pursue things that Will doesn't want to.<br/><br/>This is where Sean steps up in a key role, because he understands exactly what Will is going through. As an associate and equal of Lambeau, he knows that not everyone with the potential for greatness is designed for greatness. Unlike Lambeau, he doesn't pressure Will into doing anything. Instead, he cross examines all of Will's mindsets to give him a better understanding of life. Sean's relation of how he met his wife sort of sums up the points he tires to show Will: that nobody understands you, so they should not be the ones to determine your future and should respect the choices you make. Of course, there are some problems with this theory, but if balanced with reason and temperance it is a pretty good philosophy. I might be completely wrong about that, but that's the main thing I got out of this movie. <br/><br/>With the loosely structured story, the characters and their relationships push the plot along. This mostly involves Will growing closer to Skylar and Sean as he becomes more distant from Chuckie and his other friends. Once he realizes that he is in danger of losing his old life, he lashes out at Lambeau and does the same to Skylar when he sees that he will probably lose her. So in short, the plot is driven by emotion.<br/><br/>This emotion and the events that it causes are balanced very well by the realisticness of the characters. They all have very believable flaws and strengths that conform with the rest of their personalities. Their decisions are mixed with human nature and the individual natures of the characters. The language included, while perhaps excessive in cinematic terms, does not feel over the top since the curses are used in contexts that real-life and unscripted people use them in.<br/><br/>The acting is about as good as it gets, but the script has room for criticism. The cinematography and other technical execution flows naturally, but has no outstanding features. Essentially, it's executed well enough that you shouldn't notice one way or the other.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an emotional story, though not in a romantic or traumatic sense. There is comedy sprinkled throughout, but it should not be viewed in search of continuous laughs. Don't be deceived into thinking that it's a comedy because Robin Williams is in a main role. If you absolutely hate movies that have messages in them, be warned that this is one of those movies, but it kind of lets you take what you want from it in terms of a message. It's okay to watch with people that are prone to making comments throughout, as long as that doesn't distract you too much, but don't watch it at a party or anything. But, if you like a solid film, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the movie. Overall Rating: 8.6/10"

","This movie actually surprised me. I was expecting a boring movie about math. But then i watched it and I have watched it at least 70 times since then, maybe more. Anyways if you haven't watched this movie then i recommend it to anyone who loves moving movies. 10 out of 10 easy. I personally love Matt Damon as an actor and he truly gives one of the best performances of his career. And if u love movies then I would like to recommend another movie, A Beautiful Mind. It stars Russel Crowe and he is absolutely amazing in the movie. All in all, Good Will Hunting is definitely a must see movie and is one of my favorites of all time. Thanks for reading. Hope u enjoy the movie of u watch it...."

","Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor at M.I.T., has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist (Robin Williams) to find direction in his life. <br/><br/>What do we have here? An early acting job for Casey Affleck, produced by Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier (the best thing they have ever touched), with a score from Danny Elfman. That score is something else, because it is not one that Elfman is usually associated with, being much more subtle than his typical work.<br/><br/>Is this Matt Damon's best role? Most likely. Robin Williams' best role? Quite possibly. Ben Affleck's best role? Maybe even that. This film just sort of brought the best out of everyone involved, and is entertaining to boot."

","I can't stress enough how much this film means to me. Since my youth, I was always quite taken with Boston ‚Äì¬†Cambridge in particular. As a portrait of the academic culture's conflict with the working class culture, it can't be stressed enough that though there is something of a fairy tale quality to this, it captures the grit-teeth of the Boston working class quite convincingly. <br/><br/>The story of the evolving relationship between Will (Damon) and Dr. Sean Maguire (Williams) is fraught with difficulty, but offers an honest reflection of the sobering power of friendship in the face of self-defeat brought on by child abuse. I think always in particular of this moment where Maguire speaks to Will and gives him the advice ‚Äì that it's not his fault. We must remember this, through all our own traumas and abuses."
"drushingtolle","9","1","4","6 October 2014"," An emotional movie about accomplishing goals
","Good Will Hunting is set in Boston, I would take a guess and say the late 90's. A lot of filming was made at Bunker Hill Community College, but also at one or two pubs, a park(not the one where you park your car) and a local diner. It takes place at approximately the course of six months, judging how the movie proceeded. <br/><br/>Will, a janitor at M.I.T, is a man of personality. Although he is a man of secrets, one in particular crosses your mind. He loves to read. This is rather weird because of the fact that his ""crew"", or friends, are rather dull-witted to be honest. Because his love of reading, he has developed a habit of being well-read on all subjects. One day, Prof.Gerald Lambeau posts a math quiz on the public board in the hallways. After some time when nobody still hasn't solved it, Will decides to try, and scores right away. Prof.Gerald later discovers this, and goes of on a search for the one who solved it, thus Will wants to remain anonymous. When the Professor later finds out that Will is the one who solved it, he tries to negotiate with the Judge to keep Will out of jail, Will having recently gotten in a fight. In the deal however, Will must once a week meet a psychologist for his anger management. And of course as in any movie, Will also meets a girl, Skylar, that will turn out to be a turn for Will's life...<br/><br/>A scene I remember in particular is when the first or maybe the second meeting when Will brings up Sean the psychologists deceased wife, whom Will does not know about, and presume that she is no more in his life because of she left him or was cheating. This outrages Sean because his wife and himself had a really close bond and they truly loved each other. Just as Will was to finish his sentence, Sean grabs Will's neck and says; ""If you ever disrespect my wife again, I will end you"". After this they split apart, but I believe that this awoke something in Will, some sort of empathy for Sean, because Will is a foster child who had a crooked childhood and maybe feels like he's missing something too...<br/><br/>I would say that this movie is about following your dreams, not being afraid at trying something new, taking the big step and be brave enough to fulfill it. The theme is mainly drama, but maybe a little bit of a romantic theme as well.<br/><br/>I actually liked this movie, I can't really though put my finger on it. It's a very deep movie with a lot of emotions. If i would rate it, I would give it a 9/10 because i believe that all movies need a bit of comedy, which this one lacked. Everything else was excellent.<br/><br/>I remember the first or maybe the second meeting when Will brings up Sean the psychologists deceased wife, whom Will does not know about, and presume that she is no more in his life because of she left him or was cheating.

","What I like about this movie is that it's very kind. It makes you believe in good people and good things.<br/><br/>Will was a very gifted boy with a difficult childhood, who trusted nobody but his 3 best friends. They were his family, he would never leave them. Neither for a good and well-paid job, nor for the girl he loved.<br/><br/>He didn't believe in this traditional values, like making a career or starting a family. He knew too well that people betray and can turn their back on you when you least expect. He had his life and wasn't gonna change anything.<br/><br/>But then he was noticed by Prof. Lambeau who for some reason decided to help this very smart but rebellious boy. With his help Will met Dr. Maguire who not only was able to win Will's trust but also managed to encourage him to change something and try new things.<br/><br/>¬´Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them¬ª<br/><br/>I like their conversation in the park, where Sean Maguire said that Will knew nothing about life. All his knowledge was too theoretical, borrowed from books, not from his life experience. He was afraid to open his heart to new people or new things. Eventually he found some peace as well as also Dr. Maguire who had been hiding from real life since the death of his wife.<br/><br/>I liked Skylar, how open she was when she was talking about her feelings to Will, how honest and understanding she sounded. But still, I believe that the only reason why Will dared to change his life, was because his best friend Chuckie told him to do that. He kinda gave him permission. You should really care about someone to let the person go for his own good.<br/><br/>I love the film, I love the performance. I never got the feeling it was some acting, they all were so real and genuine. Interesting plot, great acting, happy ending. It totally deserves THE 2 Oscars it got."

","Gus Van Sant first caught my attention when I sat down with some friends to watch ""Last Days"", a biographical movie about the final days of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. The movie was beautifully done, with many long and winding scenes shot in single takes that seemed to capture Cobain's final environment and mindset perfectly. It wouldn't be long before I would see his similarly styled drama ""Elephant"" about the events leading up to a school shooting. I knew he directed ""Good Will Hunting"" but somehow its taken me 17 years to finally sit down to watch it in its entirety, and I am so glad I finally was able to scratch this gem-- number 130 on the IMDb top 250-- off of the list.<br/><br/>Hot-headed adult orphan Will Hunting (Matt Damon) leads a pretty normal life for a South Boston reprobate: between his janitorial job at MIT and getting shmacked with his buddies (Ben and Casey Affleck) at his local watering hole, Will is pretty unremarkable‚Äîexcept that he's a genius, an inexplicable phenom that has a wealth of knowledge about many topics, but due to his hard-knocks upbringing, never had any substantial education. When he starts surreptitiously solving the complex equations that are posted in the MIT halls to challenge the students, he catches the attention of mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Gerry learns that Will is in trouble with the law, and is able to make a plea with the judge: In leau of jail time, Will has to study mathematics with Gerry and go to routine therapy. After many failed attempts with a number of therapists, Gerry calls on his former college roommate and psychology professor, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to help. After butting heads initially, Will and Sean start to slowly solve the one problem that Will can't‚Äîhis own internal struggle.<br/><br/>This film is a wonderful examination of love, manhood, and socioeconomic status set to a gorgeous soundtrack (Danny Elfman). The relationship between Damon and Williams is priceless and powerful, beautifully scripted and masterfully executed (Williams won the Oscar that year for Best Supporting Actor with this role), and the addition of Minnie Driver is, to me, the icing on the proverbial cake. She is a beautiful and quirky addition to the cast and she and Damon are comfortable and charismatic together (her character was based on Damon's then girlfriend who left him for Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich just before filming). The script is a taut psychological ballet, with some of the best monologues I've heard in a good long while (Damon's rant about hitting the hash pipe and joining the National Guard especially!) To be completely honest, I think that the addition of the Affleck brothers brought this picture down a peg, though not nearly enough to weigh it down in a major way."

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

","Matt Damon is Will Hunting; an underachieving math prodigy working as a janitor at M.I.T.

Hunting has a severely deprived upbringing, involving foster care and physical abuse. Robin Williams; in his Academy Award winning role, shows up as a sympathetic psychiatrist who is recruited to rescue Will from his many demons. Williams and Damon are excellent, and the script is well written and smart, although it turns a bit too sentimental for my taste at the end of over two hours. Van Zant could have tightened up the editing; noisy bar scenes are always an unnecessary tool; and there are at least one too many in Good Will Hunting. Even with its slight defects, the film is well worth watching."

","The Good<br/><br/>A great ensemble cast who play their roles perfectly. But it's the stand out performances of Williams and especially Damon that keep you hooked. Their immediate portrayal of polar opposite characters is the cornerstone for the film and watching their characters and relationship change is nothing short of brilliant. Many stand out moments from both but then Damon has his breakout moment and steals the show. The writing from the young Affleck and Damon is transferred very well to screen. They take a simple premise and slowly pull it apart until we have something beautiful to watch. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's sad. The writers make us relate and the actors make us believe in equal measure.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>While the writers work the premise well, there are moments that are somewhat predictable. We know where the film is going and have worked out early on how it will end. They gave us great moments of drama, but no big twists in the story, it is very linear and i never felt like the route of the film would change. Also I felt it ended a whisker early. One more shot would have ended it well. <br/><br/>The Ugly<br/><br/>This is nit picking by now, but William's introduction followed the rather cheesy and much used line ""Well there is one more!"". This line wasn't needed. We knew Williams was coming and such an important character deserved a non clich√©'d welcome."

","Good Will Hunting (1997) directed by Gus Van Sant tells the story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an MIT janitor who displays a genius level IQ by solving a mathematic equation that stumps even Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd). Because of Will's rough background in a rough part of Boston includes a childhood plagued with abuse and causes him to have near-constant trouble with the law. After his genius is understood, Lambeau negotiates a deal to keep Will out of prison, given that he will attend court ordered counseling. Enter Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Lambeau's college roommate who is a psychology professor at a nearby community college. Through therapy sessions with Will, Sean and Will both begin to heal from the pain of their pasts, as well as discover a hope for the future.

In the opening scene, Will meets Skylar (Minnie Driver) who persists until the end to help Will see that he is worth loving and being loved. <br/><br/>The overall motif of Good Will Hunting is the idea of love and acceptance. Do we accept others enough to love them? Do we accept ourselves enough to allow others to love us? Do we accept our past in order to move on? Good Will Hunting is a classic coming of age tale that is excruciatingly relatable. The audience is enthralled with the poignant plot and the storyline is highlighted by the bare bones style of editing. Everything about this film feels very natural which is essential to the film feeling genuine rather than another Cinderella story clich√©. The lighting and sound are especially utilized because of the variance in setting. Will frequents a Harvard bar, Sean's office, as well as his own room. The sounds in each are very different: the loud chatter and bass music of the bar, the comfortable silences shared in Sean's office, and the buzz of incandescent lighting in Will's bedroom are all showcased. The lighting is also genuine to the settings being dimmer in the bar, almost sterile in the MIT scenes, and appropriately flickering in other scenes. Throughout the film, the audience follows the relationship between Sean and Will, as they both learn to accept themselves, each other, and their pasts."

","I feel ashamed for putting this film off for so long. I had intended to watch it for a while, but kept making excuses. My reasoning for this was that the description of this film and it's somewhat simple plot line put me off, even though the film did have the likes of Robin Williams and Matt Damon in it. Yes, the film follows a simple plot line and proceeds exactly how you'd expect it to, but there's a beauty to it; a simple beauty. It tackles psychology and the nature and feelings of the youth. And it does it perfectly.<br/><br/>The writing of 'Good Will Hunting' was nigh perfect. I wasn't expecting something so thought provoking and intelligent from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's first screenplay. Again, it's simply done but has a unique beauty behind it. You can connect with the title character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), and understand how he's feeling throughout it from his discussions with his psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Damon and Affleck outdid themselves here.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant directs the masterpiece. This is the first of his works I have came across. The directing fits the film perfectly. It's nothing big or exciting, just simple. Without the directing, the film simply would not feel the way it does. It adds to calm, slow nature of 'Good Will Hunting' and everything feels at perfect pace with the writing. The emotion is hit spot on as well, with obvious help from the actors.<br/><br/>I'd be lying if I said that I even noticed the music used in the film, which is a shame because I love Danny Elfman's other works. Everything was so focused on the raw emotion and I was so taken in by the characters. I cannot comment on the composition, but I will be able to eventually because I will definitely be watching this film again in the future. It's certainly a new one of my favourites.<br/><br/>The acting is astoundingly good. I had never seen Robin Williams out of his usual romantic comedy role before now, so this was a surprising and refreshing change. He plays the role of the aged psychiatrist perfectly. Matt Damon and Minnie Driver created amazing chemistry as their respective characters and Damon shines in his role throughout, getting every scene spot on. Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Ben Affleck got their roles spot on as well, as the rather egotistic professor who cares for his students and the loyal and loving best friend respectively.<br/><br/>Overall this was a simple masterpiece, which I did not expect in the slightest. It wasn't clich√©, as it was entirely unique in its own way, but it also had the simple plot line that you'd expect. 'Good Will Hunting' is a film I will certainly be watching again for its delightful and simple nature. If you haven't already seen this genius piece of work, I suggest that you make some time for it as soon as you can."

","This movie makes a strong statement for individuality and stepping outside of the system. The brilliance of Damon's character (Will Hunting), lies not in his mathematical genius, but in his ability to assess social structures, schemes and systems. His cynicism is an effective shield against those who would use his talents for their own personal gain. Robin Williams' character is very believable as a therapist, because while he does not necessarily support Hunting becoming part of the corporate (or government) money machine, he does express the value in using one's abilities to one's utmost.<br/><br/>the movie could have benefited from an exploration of Hunting's past (where he came from and what made him what he is), as well as some time spent in understanding what his inner thoughts and feelings are. Maybe the scene with Ben Affleck acting as Hunting's agent could have been scrapped, to fit in more character development for Hunting. Again, this movie makes an important statement about how the amoral, cookie-cutter world of business has affected us all and therefore, why some revile and avoid it.<br/><br/>This is a warning to the society we have built: Integrate those who are dis-affected, and create a world of greater humanity or we will all suffer the loss of ourselves."

","Good Will Hunting <br/><br/>The Oscar winning American drama Goodwill Hunting was released on December 5, 1997, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and directed by Gus Van Sant with a modest budget of 10 million dollars. The film was an instant success making $225,933,435 at the box office (imdb.com). The success of the movie did not come from fancy effects, or intense action scenes; however it is the script that captures the audience, which makes us, fall in love with the characters as well as the movie as a whole. The aspect of the movie that stood out the most to me was the excellent story line, which was beautifully executed by the phenomenal acting and powerful performances of the main characters, Affleck, Damon and along with the support of Robin Williams, who made this movie such a success. The script written by Damon and Affleck, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, which did not surprise me. Damon began writing Good Will Hunting in his fifth year at Harvard in a playwriting class. As a result, what was supposed to be a one act play had turn into the movie that turned these struggling actors into instant A list celebrities. (Nanos) It is very unique that the writers are able to star in their own movie, which in my opinion helped them portray the story exactly the way they wanted it. They were both a double-threat, being both the actors and script writers. Damon and Affleck were childhood friends who grew up together as aspiring actors. Both from Cambridge, Massachusetts, they were able to at authentically portray their characters as well as the city of Boston. They were extremely familiar with the setting, they were trying to depict to the audience, being from Boston, which made this film so popular among Boston residents as well as people from across the country. (Nanos) Many of the local residents were cast as extras one noted, ""the clothing was right, the way they acted, the accents, the cars they drove.""(Good Will Hunting:Released) Everything was absolutely perfect. In addition, the two were real life best friends, making the on screen chemistry between that much better. As a result, Damon and Affleck were the ideal pair to star in this movie. Robin Williams also won an Oscar for the movie for best supporting role. In creating the latter character, the screenplay offers Robin Williams the rare serious role that takes full advantage of his talents (New york times). Williams' character Sean; helps develop Will, who is the most dynamic character in this story. Without the role of Williams, and the relationship between the two, we would not see Will grow and ultimately change into the new man he becomes at the end of the movie. The back and forth arguing between Will and Sean made them so entertaining, ""this film is bright and knowing enough to bring fresh energy to the jousting between Will and Sean McGuire, the fellow underachiever who proves to be the only therapist who can handle him""(new york times) A life long friendship was soon formed between the two who challenging each other every step of the way. ""The film strains slightly in creating a set of neatly parallel friendships and by finding too many echoes of Will's problems in Sean's own past. But what it does beautifully is to develop a doctor-patient sparring that becomes affecting and important to both parties""(new york times) They both wanted each other to do more which their lives, which resulted in how the movie was ended. Sean was able to ""put his cards back on the table"" with the help of Will, and because of Sean's advice to ""Do what's in your heart and you'll be fine""(Good Will Hunting, 1997) The passion and genuine care Sean has for Will was obvious, resulting in a connection from the audience, making them want the same things for Will as Sean did. The love story aspect of the film makes it a feel good movie, which makes the audience realize what is important in life. Even though some critics claim that the plot is predictable, the movie is ended in an ironic way that surprised me (new york times). Based on the Will I knew at the beginning, I would've never expected him to go after Skylar like he did. His transformation made me realize how love can be so important and almost the only thing someone needs in life to be happy. Based on Sean's touching speech about the love he had with his wife, ""you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone could level you with her eyes. Feeling like! God put an angel on earth just for you¬Öwho could rescue you from the depths of hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel and to have that love for her to be there forever""(Good Will Hunting, 1997). At the end of the film Will was finally able to realize that he found this love with Skylar. He drives all the way across the country to be with her, which represents how love is greater than anything else. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is a touching, sentimental film, portraying life's common hardships that people deal with on a daily bases that allows the audience to connect with it. Good Will Hunting (Van Sant, 1997) opened my eyes to the meaning of love as well as what is important in life, leaving me completely satisfied after watching the movie. The feel good American drama, which unfolds as a love story, is definitely a classic that leaves me feeling the same emotions every time I watch it."
"charlie-prior","10","1","4","28 January 2014"," An incredible and important piece of film making
","For those who have given a poor rating, let me share to you my reasons for dismissing these reviews.<br/><br/>To the critics who discredit the plausibility and refer to this masterpiece as a 'hype' movie, it is absurd. The concept of the unfulfilled young man making use of his life is about as classic protagonist story that can be thrown into any movie, but what this one did was take it to the next level by making a brilliantly creative character of a repeat-offender boy genius. However, this concept is merely a tool to enable the character and relationship development that occurs throughout the play (and gives lease to great characterization from Damon), therefore criticizing this plot point is criticizing possibly the least important aspect of the film. And as for a Hollywood hype film? Hey we're still discussing its quality nearly 20 years later."

When I am stuck deciding between two movies I'll check the reviews and pretty much let that persuade me either way......AND I HATE THAT I LET IT HAPPEN!! We let ratings and reviews by complete strangers who have zero qualifications, make our decisions for us. I am as guilty as anyone. We have to stop listening to these FUN-HATING EBERT WANNABES who get their rocks off by writing these essay long reviews that contain nothing but BS. I feel sorry for those people that cannot watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is....a freaking movie. People who question the accuracy of FICTIONAL subject matter are sad, it's fiction get over it. I read a review someone wrote about how Matt Damon's character, who is a genius, all they complained about was how genius was misplayed and that a genius couldn't do this or they should do that so they rated 1/10 because they were so hurt by it. Don't let people who are mad at the world who don't get enjoyment out of life ruin what will be a very enjoyable movie experience. This movie rocks and you'll have lines to drop for days, you'll be talking in Boston accent for weeks after. WATCH IT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU ARE GET A NEW HOBBY MOVIES Aren't FOR YOU."
"sethmlanders","10","1","4","5 January 2014"," One of the BEST Movies Ever Made!
","This review is spoiler-free. Please read on, especially if you haven't seen it yet.....<br/><br/>Never has a film emotionally touched me more than this. Hands down, one of the best drama films I've ever seen. My father showed this movie to me at a young age. Unfortunately, he died not too long ago and I'm so thankful he showed me this wonderful film. After watching it several times in recent months, I observed some of the strengths that made him enjoy it as much as I did. Despite its noticeable flaws, it still holds up and leaves an impact in my heart!<br/><br/>Is it slow-paced and predictable? Oh there's no denial about that yet it connects with us on such a deep level and gives us time to learn about these interesting characters. Also, the pacing is so hypnotic that I still didn't want to stop watching, even after it ended. The vast majority of people who dislike it are either disappointed by the hype it received or are offended by the excessive profanity. My solution for these two issues is incredibly simple. One is to get passed its publicity and just take it for what it is. As for the constant swearing, try not to judge the movie based on how times the F word is spoken and instead, merely appreciate the flow of dialogue or solely listen to the purpose of why things are being said. The only way to know whether it's good or not is to watch it. I'm aware that this movie isn't for everyone, but I personally recommend you sit down and watch it from beginning to end, even if you hate it afterward.<br/><br/>For quite some time, it's been speculated that Kevin Smith and Rob Reiner at one point did revisions on the script, all the better for it! This movie is brilliantly written with powerful scenes and an alluring plot that revolves around a troubled man (played by the talented Matt Damon) who needs direction in life. Its internal conflict is something that is thought provoking with an astonishing payoff. The characters are alive and believable, while Van Sant effectively puts the audience in the right atmosphere. Some fans might have been disappointed with the apparent blandness of Skylar (played by Minnie Driver) or perhaps her weak performance, but I think she tried her best and had excellent chemistry with Will.<br/><br/>In conclusion, watch this movie to see how amazing it is. Anyone who was associated with ""Good Will Hunting"" should be proud of themselves, because they have earned my respect as an audience member. Not exactly a masterpiece, but something you can relate to and care about!"
"jackasstrange","8","1","4","15 November 2013"," Smart and touching
","Good Will Hunting may be clich√© and predictable, but still an excellent film. Affleck and Damon, with the help of both Rob Reiner and William Goldman, created a history that is at the same time smart and very beautiful and touching. The conflicts of the main character may be very relatable to anyone. For example, how many times you've realized that you could do easily certain things, but you refused to do so 'only' because they aren't what you want for your life? <br/><br/>Obviously, Will had his other conflicts, such as the trauma which leads him to do the bad things, and which as well disturb him in his relationships. This is what i found beautiful in this film. Even a genius has enormous troubles, because he is a human being like everyone. I found Will Hunting character very likable as well. I mean, how many persons never got in trouble choosing the job, trouble to plan his future, and etc. I bet that very few persons never experienced or met someone that never experienced that.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Damon is in shape, maybe bringing his best career's performance to this film. Robin Williams did a very good job as well, so well that the role earned an Oscar for him in 1998. The film's editing and cinematography are extremely well made. A curiosity would be the fact that despite the story's events being set in South Boston, great part of the main cinematography is set in Toronto.<br/><br/>Anyways, Good Will Hunting is a good watch. 8.4/10"

","I saw Good Will Hunting when it first came out in theaters; I was blown away by the story line. The screen writing is of a caliber unknown. Although the story is predictable in places, it presents a feel good approach. When the movie is over, you feel happy. Good Will Hunting does not leave you dumbfounded or begging for more because it delivers on all aspects. The chemistry between the characters is out of this world. The casting was spot on; everyone fits into their roles perfectly. <br/><br/>I watched this movie with my mom and she cried at the very end. My mom was happy that Will finally made peace and moved on to a better life. Also, we were relieved that he ended up with Minnie Driver in the end. The movie is happy, feel good entertainment that all adults can enjoy."
"RolltheClip","10","1","4","9 September 2013"," A View Into The Mind Of A Genius
","In the past few weeks, one man alone has succeeded in dividing and provoking opinions from across the internet in the most significant entertainment news of the past seven days. Ben Affleck was announced to be picking up the Cowl and continuing the cinematic legacy of the Batman. With Christian Bales performance of the caped crusader still fresh in everyones minds, many are unwilling to give Affleck the chance to prove himself. It was at this point that I decided to revisit several of his different roles from throughout his career in an attempt to come to a conclusion. The first of these films being the touching 'Good Will Hunting', co- written and starring both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>When a series of difficult equations are solved by a university janitor, he is pursued by a professor after he is arrested following a street fight. Help comes from mysterious places as he is released on the grounds that he meets regularly with both a Therapist and the Professor in an attempt to help him realise his full potential.<br/><br/>He goes through several therapists in quick succession as he outsmarts and analyses them prior to them being able to properly get to know him. This calls for Professor Gerard Lambeauto call upon his old college friend, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Both characters grew up in South Boston, which helps them to develop a connection that will test their limits.<br/><br/>Will (Matt Damon) soon understands that he has met his intellectual equal and their meetings play out much like a game of chess. It's thrilling to watch them both trying to gain the upper hand only to constantly counter each other. Williams is such an accomplished actor, always perfecting the role of the caring teacher as Hunting desperately searches for a father figure after having a turbulent childhood. Realising this, Maguire opens up to share real life experience as the genius has limited himself so much, knowing only what he knows from literature and quotations to protect himself from the pain of losing people.<br/><br/>All the characters have believable motivations for helping Will and it's good to see how they all approach it in different way. From the assertive, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) who attempts to push the genius down various career paths to Sean, who tries to guide him to find his own path, understanding that Wills difficulties originate from the abuse and neglect that he experienced in his childhood.<br/><br/>Although Affleck isn't in the lime-light throughout most of the movie there are several key scenes which really triumph in leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. With honourable mentions to his final, poignant scene. On the other hand, collaborating with Damon to create such an incredible script is a testament to their skill. Far from being a skeptic, this has really made me far more open to his take on the worlds greatest detective.<br/><br/>The movie really tackles many issues as you see the darkness that some talented people can face on a daily basis and how his past overshadows his brilliance, preventing him from taking leaps towards a better life. It really is a film based on self discovery and the events that rekindle his intentions to push himself further in his existence begin as he comprehends how many people care for him. I'd recommend this film to anyone as it can really resonate with any viewer. Everyone will, at some point in their lives, question the path their life will lead and this really is an extreme example of this as he has ran himself into the ground over the years trying to find his direction only to rebuild his foundations and understand his potential."
"johnyskar","10","1","4","6 September 2013"," Great movie, great story.
","People talks about the writing of the movie and the fact that it was great by Matt and Ben. I will add to this that both of them were young, 27 and 25 each which makes it even more great.<br/><br/>We learn the story and the problems of Will as the movie proceeds and from the other hand we witness his skills. Will was not just good at mathematics, he was very smart in general. <br/><br/>Shawn(Robin) had hard times to with his wife, so he understood Will and he taught him that he has to let people get closer to him so he can feel the love that he did even if he lost his. He did not became Will's therapist, he became his friend.<br/><br/>Will was lucky as being aggressive led hem to a cage but some teacher bailed him out because he found a math theory which he wrote. But Will was lucky too because he had good friends. They had fun together but they all new he was really smart and they wanted what's best for him.<br/><br/>Eventually, when with the help of Shawn Will decides to use his skills i am happy to see that the ending included the leaving of Will in the manner his best friend Chuckie hoped. He is happy for Will while he is sad that he does not know when he 'll see him again but that's a great friend. <br/><br/>Finally, people say that this movie didn't need to have a happy ""romantic"" ending but i would be disappointed to see that he goes for work and does not give a chance to the girl he connected so much. After all that is what Shawn taught him so he realized that he had to take the risk, they have math in California. I would like to watch Will surprise Skylar in the final scene but it's OK, i know he did. And he finally said ""i love you""."
"lesleyharris30","9","1","4","21 August 2013"," Heartwarming, Inspired Script and Performances,
","Good Will Hunting is a fantastic movie with a great plot and a very inspired cast. The script is very well written and developed by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, they should definitely write another movie together some day. The story of a young man struggling to realise his uniqueness is perfectly chronicled by them, it is deep, meaningful and very heartfelt. <br/><br/>The only thing I felt this film was lacking is more character development for people other than Will. I understand he is the main character, but I certainly would like to have learned more about Sean, Chuckie and Skylar, who all have terrific individual dialogue with Will, but that dialogue only seldom reveals more about their past.<br/><br/>All the performances in this are truly breathtaking, but the star of the show has to be Robin Williams. He is a very funny actor, but further showcases here that he had a huge gift for drama. He showed this in movies like Dead Poets Society and Good Morning Vietnam, proving without any doubt that he is just as good being serious as he is funny, going on to win an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. There was great chemistry between Damon and Williams in their scenes together, those parts are without a doubt the movies highlights. <br/><br/>The film never struggles to be meaningful, no dialogue or scene ever feels forced or thrown at its audience, the escalation is very smooth and subtle, other movies could take advice from that. Well written and superbly acted, I would recommend Good Will Hunting to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A man with a special gift, who does not want to change anything about his life, is discovered by a professor. He gets help from a professional psychologist to find out what his problem is, meanwhile he also falls for a girl. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robin Williams"
"rishabh-rishtri","10","1","4","15 August 2013"," Definitely Good ""Will Hunting"" ..
","The movie is an absolute genius in terms of screenplay and performances. Robin Williams is the best of the lot. <br/><br/>Not only it binds one into the strong narrative but also compels to think for a while about personalities. No one in the movie is wrong or negative, not even prof. Gerald Lambeau :). It's all about perspectives, about believing that raw fish tastes good (what's good for you might not be the same for all)<br/><br/>The rating might seem a little prejudiced to some, me being a big fan of Robin Williams :), but the movie definitely deserves a 10/10.

","Wow saw this movie finally the other night because I had heard of this movie tons of times from my friends and have always heard references to this movie in other movies and shows on television.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting , from the great things I had heard from I assumed I would like it and I did - Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a good job with this script / movie you can tell the work they put in to. The characters that Damon and Williams play are outstandingly brilliant in many ways. Damon and Affleck must have realized as they were putting the movie together as these characters develop so much through out the movie that they would touch the audiences hearts , they touched my heart. As Will Hunting has his ups and downs in life with his brain and some direction in his life from Sean ( robin Williams ) He grows up in a real way that I seen people do in life. <br/><br/>Robin Williams can do comedies and dramas he has proved it in this role and other roles- him as Sean is very clever , witty , gentle has wisdom and very emotional in this movie especially about his wife and about Will in the way they form a bond. When ever Sean talks to Will there is a very special tone in his voice were he relates to Will and understands him very well.<br/><br/>Skylar also added some special touches into Wills life were he realizes what love is and romantic wise ? adds to the movie . and Affleck ? well I finally know who he is and in the movie his and wills friendship is clearly seen after awhile.<br/><br/>Good Will hunting is about a lot of things like Friendship , Love , believing in yourself , Helping out other people , Growing up and much more its a very beautiful movie - I think like a couple other people on here a bit to much swearing but I say this movie gets 8 and thats well!! I might have to watch this movie again soon."
"bbewnylorac","9","1","4","10 August 2013"," Really great movie
","I have just re-watched this movie about 10 years after last seeing it. And I realise now what all the fuss is about. The script is fantastic. And the acting is perfectly judged. The film has so many things going for it. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are superb, and they just gel so well on screen. Their gang of friends is lewd and crude but very affectionate and best of all, they swear authentically and talk in native accents. Robin Williams is a strong character as usual but most of the time is quite restrained, and acts well off other characters. Stellan Skarsgaard is perfectly convincing as a wily mathematics professor who is an old friend and rival of Williams' character. Minnie Driver acts well and has some great scenes, but I think her character is too much of ""the love interest"" -- it's a pity. The plot hums along nicely and, all in all, it's a satisfying movie."
"souvik-bubun","9","1","4","8 August 2013"," One-of-the-best teacher-student drama ever PERIOD!!!!!!!!
","This film shows the value of a good teacher in one's life and it also portrays the difficulties faced by geniuses so poignantly. In a way this also gives a preview of what is to come from both Affleck and Damon,brilliant in their own rights.""Good Will Hunting"" feels like instant therapy. It is about society's inclination to push people who maybe aren't ready to be pushed. And it's for those who believe they are academic underachievers. It does not realize how much it flirts with the ""person who doesn't want to be helped"" scenario. That is a powerful theme, used to devastating effect in films such as ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Taxi Driver."" Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are happier than that. Where others see reality, they see hope. And so they won't quite go there."

","This movie is not as overrated ,and the plot as bad as some people claim. The plot is understandable, and the character is somewhat deep. The serious scenes are acted out pretty well. The end makes sense. All that being said, this movie does not live up to its ""Oscar-Winning"" hype. The start of the movie , first, kinda doesn't make any sense.If Will Hunting was so smart, how come it took him until now for someone to spot his jewel. It just doesn't make sense. The plot, however decent and understandable, doesn't seem to segue smoothly. For example, there is a scene where the professor and the therapist are arguing. Then, when Will comes in and they kiss and make up. Where in the hell did that come from? Finally, there is the ending, which is the worst part. It leaves us hanging, with no clues whatsoever as to the outcome of his trip to Cali. I am probably making this film out worse than it actually is. The movie itself is worth a good watch. Not the greatest, though."
"oneguyrambling","8","1","4","27 January 2012"," Like Will Hunting himself this is pretty exceptional.
","Good Will Hunting is manipulative and spends a good half the film playing your emotions like a piano, but it is so effective that even while you know full well what it is trying to do you can't help but allow yourself to get involved.<br/><br/>Will Hunting is a young tearaway floating aimlessly through life as his youth evaporates, yet unwilling to start making the grown up decisions. He spends most days with his three buddies hanging out, swearing, trash-talking, fighting and drinking, and his own personal time is spent janitoring and reading¬Ö His friends are more the ""whadda you lookin' at?"" type, and it is during the fighting part of his day that Will inadvertently takes a swing at a local cop.<br/><br/>Will does his janitorin' at a local college in Boston where a professor named Lambeaux (Stellen Skarsgaard) has posed a mathematical equation as a special challenge to his large group of students, he proposed that anyone who could solve this unbelievably complex problem would get a special prize and acknowledgment.<br/><br/>Will came across the equation on a whiteboard when cleaning after hours and¬Ö Shortly after Lambeaux realises the complex equation has been solved ‚Äì and with no-one coming forward to claim credit for the feat ‚Äì Lambeaux sets another, more complicated puzzle. He proclaims that while he doubts anyone will solve this one should they do so it will prove the first was no fluke.<br/><br/>Will has a quick squiz and promptly puts the answer up on the board to something that took teams of mathematicians months to solve working in unison.<br/><br/>But Will doesn't want any attention or acclaim, when confronted about his acts he runs off to a night on the town with his friends once more. Will's buddies are simple hard working guys who also play hard, they tease each other unmercifully and seem resigned that this is how their lives will pan out forever. Meanwhile will gives a verbal beatdown to a pretentious egghead in the pub and simultaneously manages to pick up Skyla (Minnie Driver).<br/><br/>Unfortunately thanks to punching the policeman Will is also thrown in prison to await sentencing for his assault. After Lambeaux manages to track him down he witnesses Will defending himself, citing obscure cases and verdicts as precedents and running verbal rings around the more experienced prosecutor.<br/><br/>Yep. Still smart.<br/><br/>But the judge ain't havin' it this time¬Ö and Will is sentenced to a stretch in the pen.<br/><br/>To fast forward a little Lambeaux manages to pull some strings and has Will released from prison on two conditions, the first that he spend some time with the maths team to see just how deep Will's intelligence and abilities go, the second that Will seek professional psychiatric help for his personal issues and anger management.<br/><br/>Will agrees, but probably more because he wants to get a shot at Skyla.<br/><br/>Will enjoys the maths side of the equation (get it?), but is far more reluctant to let someone into his head, he cuts a swathe through various shrinks, sidestepping real questions and disarming them with his superior intellect.<br/><br/>Enter Shaun (Robin Williams) a long time friend of Lambeaux and basically the last chance at success. The initial meetings and chats are perfunctory exercises, at best silent at worst rocky and heated, but both Shaun and Will gradually realise that there is more to the other than meets the eye. Shaun feels that Will is incredibly gifted but a little na√Øve and unsure of how to use his talents, but Will thinks that Shaun too is ""slumming it"" a little and taking the easy way out.<br/><br/>As the tenuous relationship grows more trusting and each comes to rely more on the other decisions must be made.<br/><br/>Lambeaux feels that Will is a once in a generation mind that could rival Einstein, he wants to ""discover"" him and unveil him to the world, Shaun only wants Will to think for himself and not merely recite what he knows from reading books and hearing others. More than anything though Will's buddies all know that he could be so much more than a janitor or construction worker, and while they bust their guts trying to get by they desperately want Will to use his natural talents to do something for himself.<br/><br/>And all the while Skyla and her big head remain in Will's thoughts¬Ö It astounds me that Damon and Affleck came up with all this in their teens ‚Äì it is well paced, intelligent and always interesting. Near the end of the film the plot threatens briefly to get a little bit ahead of itself but the loose ends are all neatly pulled together for the conclusion, which while not being incredibly satisfying served to wrap things up nicely.<br/><br/>Robin Williams is thankfully low key and realistic as Shaun, Matt Damon proved that he could act even then, and Skarsgaard has the unenviable role of being the bad guy, but he manages to show full justification for his desires.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting has become a bit of a punchline through the years, the ""How do you like them apples"" bit has been parodied, as has the success of the film in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (in a hilarious way too), but you can't ignore the impact that the film has when you watch it.<br/><br/>Final Rating ‚Äì 8.5 / 10. I remembered it more as a relic of the 90s, an anomaly that was inexplicably successful, rewatching it the other night showed me that it was worthy of the acclaim and the box office, like Will himself this is pretty exceptional."
"edrogers-272-34286","8","1","4","22 January 2012"," Subtle and beautiful in most ways, unbelievable in others.
","I can't believe how black and white the reviews on here are for this film. People either seem to think it perfect, or terrible. I have neither of these views - it was however a very good film. Not in my top 10, but certainly in the top 100.<br/><br/>It IS moving, it HAS got some beautiful and believable dialogue and it is very well acted by virtually all concerned. My favourite part being Robin William's dressing down of will: ""And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right, 'once more unto the breach dear friends.' But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet..."" etc. Well written! <br/><br/>However, the main flaw in my opinion is Matt's character. He is simply too well rounded a genius, it's unbelievable and a little arrogant of the two writers. He has real emotional flaws and that's all dandy, but personally I think he should have been out-quoted by the guy in the Harvard bar and still got the girl anyway for sticking up for his friend. I think he could have shown even more vulnerability by being really knocked by not being the best at everything. Oh well, a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Put it this way I don't know many geniuses who haven't got a blind spot in current affairs or history or social skills or SOMETHING. Saying that, the way he holds himself back with his self destructive behaviour is classic and very well portrayed.<br/><br/>It's a film I will definitely watch many times and I suggest you do too. This film is boring only in the same way the night sky is boring... it depends how deep you are willing to look and how much you are willing to think."

"ElMaruecan82","10","1","4","13 June 2011"," A well-made rather than a well-filled head ...
","Among the cinematic characters that I immediately identified with, there is ¬´ Good Will Hunting ¬ª, though I'm not fortunate enough to be gifted with the same intelligence ... BUT I know how it feels not to exploit one's own talents for his personal life and constantly try to find excuses for that.<br/><br/>The story is probably one of the most inspiring and best written scripts from the last two decades, and to think that Matt Damon is the co-writer, with his childhood friend, Ben Affleck ‚Äì they both played best buddies in the film- makes it even more realistic and inspiring. In fact, there is something that always works in the stories where the screenwriter and the lead actor are the same, take ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Great Dictator"", ""Rocky"", ""Sling Blade"" or the vast majority of Woody Allen's films, the character is written and played by the same actor, he's his own mind, and own body, there is an authentic feeling as if the man doesn't even play. The script is personal, and the film is only an excuse to transcend something personal into a biggest project that would create a wider appeal. And I would never say enough how ""Good Will Hunting"" appealed to me.<br/><br/>The story, is about a kid, a tough kid, an extremely intelligent tough kid who grew in South Boston and lived the kind of childhood that could have been laughably clich√© had the movie been handled by a bad director or editor. But the revelations of his past go so smoothly that Will Hunting, despite his good intentions, appears more like an arrogant prick than a victim, and THIS is interesting. To depict him as a victim would have considerably changed the value of his gift, it would have been the solution of his problems while in fact, it works like a double-edged sword. Will has an extraordinary power of abstraction, or memorization, of understanding that he can solve the toughest Maths problems, can speak of History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Philosophy, like you'd speak about the one thing that passionate you the most, and he probably knows better than you even in that field. Basically, Will makes you feel dumb, or useless, or unable to use your own knowledge. Even the professor Gerald Lambeau, who'll try to find a future for Will, ends up like a Salieri recognizing his worthless value compared to Will, the Mozart of Mathematics.<br/><br/>But the key of the story is to understand the reasons of Will's behavior, which obviously would lead him to a dead-end. When you think about it, his intelligence saved him from jail, which allowed him to know his girlfriend. Speaking of her, let's get back to the scene where they meet. The scene is probably one of the most memorable cinematic ""ownage"" where Will avenges his best friend who was victim of a literally intellectual bullying by an arrogant Harvard prick. Will puts him in his place with the idea that it doesn't takes studies to be intelligent, it takes enough curiosity to learn more than what we're intended to and then try to put that knowledge into perspective. An excellent lesson about how to use our intelligence. But then something ambiguous happens, when Will meets his therapist, Sean Maguire, Robin Williams in a quite perfect performance. Will acts with him exactly the same way the Harvard boy did, using his knowledge to try to push him down. But instead of being upset, Sean feels the potential of Will and a nice retort for the next meeting. ""Do you think I would understand how it feels to be an orphan because I read Oliver twist?"" Will knows, but his knowledge is theoretical, there's the tragic feeling of emptiness governing his life. Life is about guts, heart, emotions, and Sean, animated by a growing fatherly love, will try to open Will's heart, so he can give his life a meaning as Sean obviously found something in Will, to get out from his self-pitied widow condition, a man lost in his memories with no better future.<br/><br/>Will Hunting is not a bad guy, as implies the title's adjective. But he fears rejection, and hangs out with the same group which work like an indirect carapace. He's certainly not incapable of being friendly, in love or having fun, but as soon as things go serious, he becomes defensive. The movie provides a fascinating character study in the real sense of the world, we are put in the shoes of a psychiatrist and try to understand Sean's motives, and why Will is such a hard nut to crack. It's an intelligent movie about intelligence, and that respects our intelligence, and more than that, the intelligence of the film is carried by an excellent script that brings so many moments of verbal delights. Will's speeches are priceless; it's like reciting a whole book, with coherence and inspiration. And the films question our visions of intelligence : for Lambeau, it's Excellence, for Maguire, it's Happiness. The inspiring message of the film, is that Will Hunting can reconcile between both. Inspiring is indeed a word that rhymes with ""Good Will Hunting"". And I think Minnie Driver deserves a mention as the one who drove the heart element of the film, as Skylar ‚Äìwhy did they had to name her like that anyway-, who had such a genuine feeling, I thought her romance and break-up created another authentic dimension in Will's multi-layered personality.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" is an exploration into the complexities of human relationships, and on a self-reflexive approach, the conclusion of the film is like a mathematical problem finally solved, but human relationships is not an exact science you know, so maybe, I say maybe, happiness is a little more important than excellence ¬Ö as the French author, Michel de Montaigne, said once : ""a well-made rather than a well-filled head."""

","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wasn't a very common name to Hollywood in the 90s. They only came in 'average' films that nobody cared about. Fortunately, they won respect from everyone after this film came out...<br/><br/>Getting to my 'review', this film is literally brilliant, dashingly shot, brilliant acted, warmly directed, and profoundly written. Damon and Affleck truly mesmerized me in the film. The acting was great; Damon, Affleck, Williams, Driver, and Sk√†rsgard were all perfect.<br/><br/>The script was true and understandable, because of the literal and profound combinations of powerfulness. The 'young' men deserved their Academy Award for their script...<br/><br/>As for the Academy Awards (themselves) for a disappointment. Titanic didn't deserve what it got, (especially Best Picture). All the films were simply ruled out, with this one only winning TWO! Williams and Damon/Affleck went home with grins, but the WHOLE cast should have...<br/><br/>Other than that, this film is outstanding in every way and shouldn't be missed by older teens and adults alike.

","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserved the Oscar for their wonderful screenplay, especially when you consider how young they were when they wrote it. They created a simple story that wonderfully illustrates how wounded a soul can get. I love how they show how people are introduced into a life that gives them an opportunity for help. Robin Williams does a wonderful job and thoroughly deserved his Oscar. The scene where he gets Matt Damon's character to breakthrough and come face to face with what the root of his problem is is wonderful, and I cry every time I see it. I also love the scene where Matt Damon's character's instincts are shown when he quietly watches when his friend, Ben Affleck's character, tries to pick up Minnie Driver's character. Matt Damon's character quickly realizes that his friend has walked into territory where he is out of his league, and I love when he jumps in and shows his loyalty to his friend and completely embarrasses the arrogant guy from Harvard. In any event, a great film and very well done."

","Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a gift in mathematics; however, he has had struggles growing up as an orphan. He struggles to find a purpose in his life. Hanging around with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Morgan O'Malley (Casey Affleck), and Billy McBride (Cole Hauser) and going to clubs after work are the norm for Will and his pals. Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsguard) works at the local university where Will is employed as a custodian. Professor Lambeau gets a sense of Will's gift when a question he has posted on a board outside of his classroom mysteriously becomes solved by someone outside of his class. Will, is in fact the one that has been providing the solutions. After a run-in with the law, Professor Lambeau, wants to give Will a chance to use his skills. Professor Lambeau, being a mathematician himself, takes on the responsibility of Will and posts bail for him. The only conditions for Will are to assist Professor Lambeau in the math area and Will must meet with a psychiatrist on a weekly basis. The psychiatrist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), takes on the task of counseling Will when no other counselors could seem to accomplish the task.<br/><br/>Will meets with Sean Maguire and demonstrates his intelligence by testing the doctor of his thinking. Matt Damon displays excellent acting skills, along with Robin Williams when they meet in their sessions. Their sessions evolve into a great friendship of trust and love. Will was abused by his foster father and relates to Dr. Maguire as he was also abused by his father.<br/><br/>Professor Lambeau's main goal with Will is to find him employment where he may use his amazing mathematic skills. He wants Will to have what he could not have because his mathematic skills are not so amazing. Will makes fun of the Professor's attempts throughout the movie in setting up various employment opportunities. The Professor and Dr. Maguire have words because Dr. Maguire feels that Professor Lambeau is trying to decide Will's life for him.<br/><br/>Will also meets a girl, Skylar (Minnie Driver), who he falls in love with, but given his past he has a hard time remaining in the relationship because he is afraid to be committed to someone.<br/><br/>This movie is very well written and directed. It has humor, love, and friendship all combined into one. The music is fitting and the scene angles vary from subjective to objective. There is closeness exhibited in the scene where Dr. Maguire and Will meet for the first time. The scene is very intense. There is also use of a high-angle shot during the intimate scene with Will and his girlfriend, Skylar. A viewer must watch the film to see if Will finds his purpose in life‚Äîwill he go after the girl? Will he pursue the employment that Professor Lambaugh sets up for him? Or will he continue his everyday usual events of hanging out with his pals?"

","A university professor seeks to help a mathematical genius who has had problems with the law and on his release, Will Hunting (Damon) must agree to see a psychologist.<br/><br/>Opening with a colourful slow moving montage of a long haired Matt Damon scribbling maths equations on his mirror, we are instantly engaged into a strong psychological drama that will make you laugh, cry and be enticed into a world of intelligence.<br/><br/>This splendid picture, almost 13 years old now, has lost none of its relevance in real world story telling. Written by Damon and Ben Affleck, the two dive deep into the world of a man with personal problems whilst being mathematically gifted, much to his disappointment. The two friends picked up an Oscar for their best original screenplay and over the course of 1997 it seems this was the most refreshing and hit the drama harder than most. Had it not been for a bravado OCD suffering portrayal by Jack Nicholson then Damon would surely have been a certain for the best actor.<br/><br/>Robin Williams managed to scoop best actor in a supporting role and his power of intelligence to read people in his role is staggering. His ability to conform to the form and thoughts of a psychologist is a brilliant execution of using his job and his own personal experience to associate with the troublesome Will. Certain improvisations such as the little secrets about his wife and the story about the baseball game are all little revelations, all sweet real life stories that we as viewers are able to associate with and because of these inclusions we can sit and enjoy the high power of the drama but chill and laugh along in some of the light hearted sequences.<br/><br/>This film's ability to conform to the comedy and drama genre is excellent whilst throwing in the odd romance ideology and scientific lexis. Minnie Driver adds a subtle intelligence to the film with her protagonist's enthusiasm but also youthful vulnerability in the face of her feelings. And again these performances by all members are so real and identifiable you feel enticed right into their personal stories and believe me this is no exaggeration. Whilst the film revolves around complex concepts such as mathematical equations, the power of labour and conditional love this can be viewed by any person and be appreciated on any level as there are great comedy sequences, the ""How do you like them apples?!"" to the dramatic ""Its not your fault"".<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant is able to further establish his authority through basic real worldly settings, such as the sequence on the bench by the pond and the rough neighbourhood which is very good at establishing character development.<br/><br/>My words will do this film an injustice because it is so breathtakingly forward in its approach to real world issues such as youthful violence and naivety and taking life for granted but should you watch it, you will not have your time wasted."

I don't really care to see movies I Don't know much about but I decided to give this one a try none the less.<br/><br/>To sum it up in a few words, I was Blown away.<br/><br/>From the acting to The Oscar winning screenplay this movie will touch you in a truly unique way. The movie starts of with Will Hunting (Matt Damon) going through is ordinary day to day life, which is filled with hanging round with his buddies, his part time job as a janitor and brutally beating up jerks. Although is high intelligence is apparent and shown through all this you can't help but wonder whats really wrong with this troubled genius. So after the Math professor of the collage catches him solving some the impossible sums he set for his class, he decides to bail him out from prison (kicking a cop in the crouch will get you there pretty quickly no matter how smart you are). So Will is bailed only under certain conditions which are that he must attained a weekly math class with the professor and meet a psychiatrist twice a week. Although the math classes are working out well, Will is convinced the does not need a psychiatrist and makes sure that all best possible options turn tale and head out the door. Thus the professor his forced to go to his former collage room-mate for help. This is where me meet Robin Williams in his Oscar winning role of a troubled psychiatric with his own troubled past.<br/><br/>This is where the movie lingers on and has we try do go deeper into Will thoughts we find more and more about the other people in his life whom he seems to have a profound effect on. Something people will notice is how Will's problems in his life are not so much different than ours and with Gus Van Sant's brilliantly simply direction it is shown with more heart than you can handle. As Will goes through problems with his love life, his past and what his future hold for him, we realize his life his a potential that all our lives should be. Apart from this each character is superbly distinguished as each play a different role in Will's life which is one of the many fine touches of the screenplay. This movie is almost all dialogue and the dialogue is pretty heavy most times thus not making it appealing to everyone's taste (which movie really is) but I highly recommend it as it one of the few movies that by the end of it you'll either smile or cry because you will look back at your life in truly different way."

But apparently from those ""straight"" movies we can still see his preference. In Good Will Hunting, we see, from Sant's eyes, Matt as a pretty beautiful boy, eyes reflected by the mirror when writing on it carefully; sitting in the bus alone and looking outside the window thinking about his life; reading big books every night before sleeping in his small room; talking with Sean by the river looking at him while he's talking, shocked speechless...

","A math genius, Will, grows up in the back streets of Boston. Will has never sought any formal education and frequently gets in trouble with the law. He gets a job as a janitor at Harvard University. Between sweeping floors and cleaning toilets, he finds the time to solve extremely complicated math equations. A professor at Harvard attempts to take him under his wing and to save him from his latest prison sentence. The professor guarantees the court that Will will seek psychotherapy. After a number of therapists refuse to work with him, the professor asks an old friend to counsel Will. Enter Sean, Robin Williams, a man who also grew up in the back streets of Boston. Sean is able to relate to the troubled Will, and thus the healing begins¬Ö I adored this film when it first opened. It had a fresh, funny, emotionally-charged script. The script was written by two young writers, who had lots of potential to become the most celebrated writers in Hollywood. Instead of sticking to the writing, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon chose the easier path. They became ""action"" movie stars on the back of Good Will Hunting and left their writing behind. I always thought that this was a shame, that they didn't stick with writing screenplays. Because of this, I think the film lost some of its initial impact. Don't get me wrong. It is still a notable work. When most audiences watch it, they find themselves cheering Will on, as he ""cuts"" elitist college students down to size. The most hardened and cynical viewers will find it hard not to shed a tear, as Will confronts his past. But what really makes this film masterful is that we are not just told that Will is a Genius. He proves it in every scene. Whether you are listening to his piquant repartee with other characters or his philosophy on life, you are struck by the intelligence of his remarks. The dialogue throughout the film is exceptional. It is earthy and natural (to stay true to the background of Will's character), but it is also adept and sometimes quite, profound.<br/><br/>In the ten years since Good Will hunting was released, Affleck and Damon have written only two other screenplays. In fact, they dropped off the writing ""radar"" to such a degree that rumours began to surface that William Goldman wrote the script. Goldman vehemently denies this. So it appears, for now, that Good Will Hunting may be a one-hit wonder. But I still have hope that when Affleck and Damon's action movie days are behind them, they will collaborate on one last script. And if it is half as good as Good Will Hunting, it will be a smart script with Oscar-winning potential."
"garydiamond","9","1","4","8 February 2008"," An underrated film that may be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.
","It has taken me several years and many viewings of this film to finally be able to give it the review that I think it deserves, from my point of view. And the very fact this has been a laboured decision has probably been a good thing. Very few of my favourite films have been ones that I can sit down and review right away. They're usually so profound I have to experience them at different points in my life and at every turn, be amazed and vindicated by them.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is no different.<br/><br/>I want to start with my favourite aspect of the picture: the script. The script is by my definition completely sublime. It moves seamlessly from group dialogue, to one-on-one revelatory back and forth dialogue, to some of the all time best monologues I've ever heard. The monologue, so long associated with the diatribe of a supervillian in action films, is given new meaning here. The script manages to touch upon the many facets of human existence and reaction without sounding contrived or clich√©d. If Damon and Affleck never write another script, never mind. This is one that defies all expectation. There is strong, believable character development throughout. At the moment I empathise with Will; young, ambitious, cocky and uncertain. I expect as I grow older, I will tend to empathise more with Shaun; experienced, intellectual and with an enduring 'down but not out' attitude.<br/><br/>This magnificent script is backed up by career defining performances. Matt Damon does a great job of the intelligent yet lost genius Will Hunting. We see that behind a defensive facade there is a fragile, talented individual making tentative steps into a potentially difficult adulthood. Ben Affleck is so good here as Will's best friend that I find it hard to believe he hasn't done anything as poignant since. As a blue-collar man with a simple philosophy (and one of the best monologues in the film, no less) he really defines and exceeds his archetype. Minnie Driver also performs wonderfully in an underrated role as Skylar - as with Affleck she is on such form that I can't believe she has not yet matched this performance. The real star turn here is of course Robin Williams, on startling form as a grieving psychologist. It's hard to describe how pivotal his role without giving away plot points. It suffices to say, it's an excellent study into character dimension.<br/><br/>With the script and performances discussed, it must also be said that the cinematography matches the intent of both perfectly. There is a nice mix of both shallow and deep focus shots, interesting and not overstated use of colour when contrasting both in and outdoor scenes and many other pleasing touches a more astute eye than mine will be able to identify. The film is also underpinned by a moving never obtrusive soundtrack; I was delighted to hear Elliott Smith featuring no less than three times.<br/><br/>To summarise without drifting into unending hyperbole, yes this film require some suspension of disbelief. If you are particularly gifted in the field that Will is purported to be a genius in, you may have a hard time. Even I identified some of the problems he faces as simplistic. I believe this course of action is taken to prevent alienation of the audience - a complex discussion of the intricacies of advanced mathematics would stiffen the pace and be besides the point. The film is about the journey of the protagonist; how a precarious genius might perceive the world around him or her in such a different way as to make social interaction difficult. It paints such a great picture that I feel that here is an underrated film that should be rendered 'classic' by the passage of time.<br/><br/>Here's hoping! 9/10"

","It wasn't that deep- quite entertaining though, as I usually like movies about an exceptionally talented character, featuring some mindgames, or situations where the character makes use of his ""powers"".

I mean you have this boy, great at everything, and then he's voluntarily living his life like a loser, so that he can stay faithful to his friends? And at the end -he goes after his girlfriend, wow, like that's something really deep. In fact, I don't usually make much of a philosophy about movies; in this case there are some interesting ideas, like the one that no matter how much knowledge you acquire, that can't equal true experience, but 1. they're not really new or original, just OK and 2. they are generally connected to Will as a genius, an ultimately unrealistic situation. So as I said, it's cool to watch, but not that thoughtful as it probably aims to be. One last thing- a little goof which made me feel really awkward about the seriousness of the movie makers. I stopped the tape to see the problem written on the board in the hallway- and it took me about 10-15 seconds to solve it. It was hilarious- the problem was to write a simple 3*3 matrix and do some of the most basic, basic operations with it. Not even a problem, an easy exercise- for a 10 year old. And the second problem- I didn't even have to stop the tape there, I mean come on- a problem on which the whole crew of the professor worked for 2 years-2 years!!!- how on earth could be possibly solved with a couple of drawings?? and not a single mathematical symbol?? A couple of simple graphs, that was all. This was so embarrassing it made me seriously reconsider my appreciation of the movie. Not that it is significant- but how hard can it be to get a real mathematical problem-not the the prime-number-formula but Anything which cannot be solved within seconds, and barely Looks like a problem. Not to mention that after this episode any praise of Will's talents was kind of feeling stupid."

This film deservedly won two Oscars and deserves all of the hype it has received. Go and see it for yourself."
"sbharti","10","1","4","30 December 2007"," A True Inspirational Movie.
","Good Will Hunting is about inspiration. Its about the ""good"" before ""will hunting"" which says every man is good, and he has got his history, and its all about bringing that ""good"" from a human being. Its about the connection between teacher and student, doctor and patient, father and son. 10/10.<br/><br/>This story is kinda mystery, the more it unfolds the more it leaves for you to see and imagine. I liked the way it started, u know kids fighting and drinking and wooing girls blah blah, but it takes u for a ride when Robin Williams, which I felt was the best puller of the movie, comes into picture. Not surprising that he appears first while listing the cast, even though he appears among the lasts actually in the movie.<br/><br/>Its about relationships. Its about friendship between Will and Chuckie. Its about love between Skylar and Will. Gerald and Sean are old friends, though they fight over silly principles and beliefs. Its about those fights. Will had no future before he met a mentor like Sean. Its about that bond. When Sean says ""Good Luck, Son!"", it means the depth of that teacher-student relationship.<br/><br/>Everyone of the cast has done their jobs beautifully. Matt as Will is like a true brat, but smart, genius at the same time. Ben is wonderful. Wish everyone has a friend like him. Skylar is a smart girl, at the same time longing for love. She is beautiful too. Gerald the professor is really good in all of his work. Of course reminds me of college days. But the person who steals the show is Sean, played by Robin Williams. I liked him so much that I read a lot about him, probably I would check out his other movies too.<br/><br/>All this tells u is ""We have got answers for every damn question in others life, but what is more important is to get answers for those questions, when Its My Life!"""
"dragonshield","8","1","4","6 October 2007"," Basic drama writing at its very best
","Will Hunting is a troubled young man who spends his free time hanging around bars and cleaning the floors of a university. However, Will isn't a typical youngster as he has unbelievable mathematic abilities and an outstanding photographic memory. Will soon gets into trouble but a professor who's seen what he's capable of makes a proposition which includes Will to see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist after another refuses to see Will anymore as he's so uncooperative. Will eventually meets his match, a psychiatrist Sean McGuire, who finally makes Will to open up his mind and think about what he wants to do with his life.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" is a feel good movie. Though it is kind of a basic drama, it is still drama at its best. This is really what the drama -genre should be, as the film doesn't really go into other genres at all, it follows the pattern of a great drama, but it somehow manages to be surprisingly good. The story's interesting, though it isn't that unique after all, but it captures your attention right from the start. It's just something that's easy for your eyes and it's a real pleasure to watch. You don't feel stressed at any part of the film, every scene matters and there isn't anything unnecessary anywhere. Screenplay's written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and it is indeed very well written and you can really see where they were heading at with it. It hasn't really got any amazing twists and turns, it's just brilliant on its own. I'd like to see Damon and Affleck collaborate some more in the future, as this is what a true drama is really, and after all, about.<br/><br/>The film also includes great role performances, so that may be one of the reasons why it's also so surprisingly good. Matt Damon is great as Will Hunting, the main character. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is perfect for the role of the professor Gerald Lambeau and his role performance is solid. Ben Affleck also does his job flawlessly, and I really think he is in fact a good actor but people just don't seem to get it because of what movies he's been in in the past. He doesn't get the chance of a perfect role for him, but hopefully that will also change in the near future. Just stop slaying the guy and let's see how far can he really go. Minnie Driver fits for the role of Skylar, the girlfriend of Will Hunting, and she has an incredible chemistry with Damon. All of the scenes where they are with each other are really strong and powerful, you can really see or sense these sincere emotions between them. Those scenes really speak for themselves and what is true drama acting at its best, as there happens the unquestionable and respected tearing away the actor from the character itself, which makes it seem like there is no acting involved at all. That's just how real it feels and looks like.<br/><br/>Despite that, that is not the best thing the film has to offer, as there is one actor above everyone else and that is Robin Williams, who's in the supporting role of the psychiatrist Sean McGuire. Williams is pure excellence, he's just absolute perfection and without a doubt the best thing you see in the entire film. McGuire is also a man with a troubled past, so the characters of Sean McGuire and Will Hunting find something in common, which firstly leads to an odd friendship, but then transforms itself into a true beauty where the word ""friendship"" gets a whole new meaning. The dialog between Williams and Damon is fantastic, being sometimes hilarious yet being smart and clever all of the time. Robin Williams even won an Academy Award from this devotion to the character, IE the best actor in the supporting role, which is a more than a deserved win. Overall I must say that the film shines with magnificent actors in the right roles, so the casting did pretty much a flawless job.<br/><br/>Although ""Good Will Hunting"" is also, as mentioned, hilarious at some points it's also very dramatic, so it slightly mixes up drama with comedy, although maintaining the main perspective in the drama -genre. It's definitely worth a watch after all. Movies like these with this kind of a special flow, which means you don't want it to end but you want it move along as well as it is just so entertaining all the time, don't come out too often. You just can't wait what will happen next. Directing is done by Gus Van Sant, who I think hasn't really done anything that amazing before or after ""Good Will Hunting"". Yes, the directing is great, but you can't really direct a bad movie if the screenplay's this good. Damon and Affleck even won an Academy Award from it, so question is why not write something together in the near future? The Academy Award really speaks for itself, ensuring the fact that writing together again would be a good idea. It would probably be worthwhile."

","I cant stop to wonder why it is that so many people like to relate a movie (meaning = entertainment) to real life. people, that is not what movies are for, those things are called Documentaries and the 8 o clock news. Movies are for entertainment, and so is Good Will hunting.<br/><br/>It is meant to make you feel something, and fortunately for us, everybody feels different after seeing this movie, great! but to go as far as saying: its putting janitors in a bad daylight, and they didn't wrote the script, its not historically correct, etc, etc, and then giving this movie a 1 score, is saying more about you then this movie in itself.<br/><br/>If you did not like this movie, because you have a different taste, or just did not liked the story, great, please do rate this movie low(er), but you cannot hide the feeling you got from this movie, be it goosebumps, anger, sleep or whatever. that is at least something. I have seen a lot of movies where I did not felt anything afterwards, now that means the movie was bad! Skylar and Will play great together. I can totally feel the fun the had in the beginning of their relationship. The tight friendship with his friends is totally heartwarming, and Robbin Williams really felt like a good, soft man to me.<br/><br/>I smiled, swallowed, cried, laughed and busted my gut on this movie. sure, the story could be better, but the feeling i got from it not.<br/><br/>I know the jokes inside out in this movie, and still, when I watch this movie, I laugh.. that alone is worth a 10 to me."

","Simply put - excellent writing, excellent directing, and excellent acting. They got it all right, and amazingly the lexicon and feeling of S. Boston ""Southie"". A must see for any fan of classics or modern excellence. The cast was superb, and I particularly enjoyed the interaction between Will Hunting and his friends. Very true to form, and full of real dialogue and overall interaction (that makes you feel you are a fly on the wall). Minnie Driver was a ""knock out"" and her acting was perfect for the role and mood of the film. Finally, Robin Williams added stability and a real sense of humility to the film to ground it fully in the pit of your heart and stomach. What else can I say? A film you can watch over and over again - repeat the lines, and still go back for more."

","This is the perfect example of the old saying ""never judge a book by its cover"". I've never been a Ben Affleck fan but I've always had a soft spot for Matt Damon but i wouldn't give Gus Van Sant the time of day, so i was hesitant in hiring this.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a fantastic film. Its beautifully written (by Matt and Ben), the performances are amazing to say the least (Matt Damon and Robin Williams both give the performances of their career) and, dare i say it, Gus Van Sants direction is worth the price of the admission ticket alone.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting s a film about a young Boston boy Will Hunting (no surprises there). Will is a genius. He has a photographic memory and he can solve mathematical problems the prize wining mathematicians can not. But Wills very hot headed. Aside from being a genius he also enjoys brawling and getting drunk every night (but who doesn't?). When he faces possible jail time hes sent to see a psychiatrist (Compellingly brilliant Robin Williams) as the tag line says, his match.<br/><br/>This film is so smart in the way its written its almost hard to comprehend that Matt Damon and Ben Afleck actually wrote it (i have faith in Damon but Aflecks contribution is a whole other story). This film deserves all its hype and praise. Willaims deserves his rightful kudos and Damon and Affleck deserve their Oscars. But their involvement in the writing of this film will go down as one of the greatest conspiracy theories ever like JFK's assassination and Kurt Cobains ""murder"".<br/><br/>""right now we feel like the Mellie Vanilli of screen writing"" - Ben Affleck"

","The quote is from one of several memorable scenes from the movie, when Will presses Sean's buttons in their first meeting, only to be VERY surprised by his reaction (and also probably gaining respect for the man, which evolves into a genuine friendship). I just saw it again for the umpteenth time.<br/><br/>Other favorite scenes include his emotional confrontation with Skylar, in which he finally drops all pretenses and shows her the real him, and the final emotional scene with Sean, when Will finally bursts open like a dam.<br/><br/>Oh, lest I forget, Lambeau's surprise in the beginning, when he finds out who's been solving his mathematical puzzles, is a gem.<br/><br/>Everyone was outstanding. For Robin Williams, this performance ranks right up there with ""Awakenings"", ""Good Morning Vietnam"", and ""Dead Poet's Society""; the breadth and depth of the characters he's portrayed in all of these movies is amazing. He rightly deserved the Oscar. The man's a d*** genius.<br/><br/>Hard to believe this is the same guy who played Mork.<br/><br/>It's just too bad he hasn't had very many of these kinds of roles, and too many of the soppy, sentimental melodramas like ""Bicentennial Man"".<br/><br/>Mini Driver, though I'm not a fan of hers, was also very good, and added the right balance to Will.<br/><br/>Everyone, and everything about this movie was excellent; it hit all the right notes. My hats off to Damon and Affleck for their screenplay! Reading some of the negative comments about this film, I have to say I'm stunned. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but, if you didn't like this movie, I can't imagine there are very many you will like, as it doesn't get too much better than this.<br/><br/>What a shift for Matt Damon, from playing an anti Semite, upperclass, preppie jerk in another excellent film, ""School Ties"", to playing a blue collar, streetwise roughneck here.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this movie!"
"leviot","10","1","4","25 May 2006"," Outstanding drama, with great depth
","'Good Will Hunting' will always remain one of my favorite movies. It has an engaging storyline, great acting, and enormous emotional depth. It's hard to believe Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were young college students when they conceived of this complex story.<br/><br/>The story is about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a troubled young man who is working as a night janitor at Harvard University. He also happens to be a one-of-a-kind math genius, and catches the attention of award-winning math professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) as he begins solving difficult math problems left on the blackboard.<br/><br/>Will, however, has no interest in pursuing a prestigious career in mathematics. He only reluctantly agrees to hold private lessons with the professor, being the only way to get out of jail after a spate of violence lands him there. Part of his parole deal, however, is to meet with a therapist twice a week. After getting a couple of shrinks to give up on him, Will finally lands with psychology teacher Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) who has a similar background as Wills', hailing from the same tough neighborhood in south Boston.<br/><br/>As Sean tries to get through to Will emotionally, the professor tries to train Will's mind in advanced mathematics. All the while, Will, who has had trouble maintaining a loving relationships due to his troubled past, begins to get seriously involved with a girl named Skylar (Minnie Driver). Meanwhile, the professor and the psychiatrist, who've had a rivalry of sorts back in their day, begin to quibble over what's best for Will's future.<br/><br/>Filled with great profound dialogs and intense emotional scenes, it's an immense emotional experience. It obviously has very 'heavy' subject-matter, and thus not an easy light watch, but it is very rewarding and entertains throughout.<br/><br/>It's also a great buy because you will need repeated viewings to appreciate all its subtleties."

With no family, he spends most of his time hanging with his best friend Chucky (Ben Affleck) and others, wasting his talents in order to get drunk and cause problems.<br/><br/>His talents are picked up however by a university professor who takes Will on as a prot√©g√© in order to keep him out of prison, but Will must also seek help from a psychiatrist.

Will has a journey to make, one that will take him through his past and re-invent him with the help of his friends and his shrink.<br/><br/>The film deserves all the praise it got. The screenplay by Damon and Affleck is simply nothing short of stunning, with more than believable characters and situations. The dialogue is snappy, warming, harsh and fun all at the same time.<br/><br/>Robin William's excels as Damon's shrink, taking the role by both hands and really bringing out his character that is fun, down to earth and also suffering from his own trauma. Because of this he and Will feed off one another, each learning something new about their own personality.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant's directing is as practical as it needs to be. No funky camera shots, no gimmicks, just straight into the action, telling the story, and that what makes a film truly great.<br/><br/>If your type of film has to involve gun fights and loose women then steer clear, but if you are looking for a heart warming story that will touch you and perhaps make you look at your own life, then look no further, because Good Will Hunting is simply nothing short of genius."

","My brother bought Good Will Hunting on Sunday night at Best Buy and I finally saw it last night on the big screen. All I can tell you of this fine movie was that the script was made excellently by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. They wrote the movie in a great and neat way that is extremely original. The performances and acting was terrific. Matt Damon performed his temper tantrum, genius character in a very pleasant performance that I enjoyed watching. But the best of them all, had to be academy award winner, Robin Williams. He put up the best performance I have ever seen, even over his Mrs. Doubtfire character. He definitely stole the show as an emotional and smart psychiatrist. Good job, Williams. There was a lot of funny scenes also and the movie kind of reminded me of A Beautiful Mind. There both almost very similar in ways. The negatives that I have to give for the film was that it was pretty slow at times and needed to boost up. On some of the scenes they needed more energy on it. Just got kind of boring and some of the scenes held some flaws. Overall, a pleasing Damon and Williams film that I would like to watch again soon.

The language and the acting is just so incredibly real. Everyone knows a Will Hunting type and can relate to that. Or at least I know I do. The message about letting people in and trusting others isn't slammed into your face. Rather, it's shown through real emotion.

","I really enjoy watching this film, and it is one of the very few films that I think I could get to the end of it and actually stand to go straight back to the beginning and watch it all over again.<br/><br/>Whether it is intentional or not, this film runs far deeper than it appears to. The fact that Will (Matt Damon) is a brilliant mathematician and incredibly intelligent is not what is important, and for me it is not the drive of the film. Too many people pick at the plot holes concerning Will's ""gifts"" and it spoils their interpretations of the film. Will's genius is simply an intriguing aspect that provides foundations for what I think is more complexity. <br/><br/>What this film does is embrace the fact that there is nothing more important in life than other people. Will represents a safe path, a life that so many of us choose to live because we feel comfortable. Sean (Robin Williams) and Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) represent two paths out of safety and into something that is ultimately more worthwhile. Sean encourages a life encompassed by love, intimacy and experience, while Lambeau represents a life immersed entirely in intellectual achievement and the social high ground. One of these paths is, while incredibly gratifying, essentially empty, whereas the other is entirely fulfilling. <br/><br/>This film helps us understand that we can't learn everything about life from books. Life is about the precious little experiences that are personal to us, that really matter, that touch our hearts or make us think. It is about experiencing the little imperfections in people that make them beautiful only to you. And throughout life, it is important that we follow our hearts and do what we truly want to do, and not what society expects of us.<br/><br/>Ultimately, like so many films, Good Will Hunting is about love. But it conveys the emotion in ways that are more subtle, and beyond the boundaries of oozy sentimentality that few films bother to cross.<br/><br/>How do I like them apples? I like them a lot."

","I recently watched it after a four year absence and thought very highly of it.  I wasn't to keen at first a while back but I have matured and understood what the film was trying to get across and thought it was very clever the way they did it.  Without the acting in this then their would be no Good Will Hunting and I wouldn't be reviewing this film now and the same goes for the script.    This is one of Ben Affleck's good films and the same has to be said for Matt Damon but I am yet to see a bad Affleck/Damon film, then again I am the only person who hasn't seen Gigli but I will blame J.Lo for that.   But the script alone is a masterpiece of writing from both of them.  It has the making to make you feel bad and feel good all at the same time without breaking a sweat which brings me on to telling you another reason why I admire this so much.   It doesn't stop for a second.  Even though there is no big plot to follow and any suspense there is always something happening in each scene of the film which is just terrific for a film of this type.    If I was to compare another film made recently to Good Will Hunting then it would be Lost in Translation.  Both films have characters who are lost and are afraid and the mood of the film is very bleak if a little up lifting at times.  Good Will Hunting just isn't a great drama though, it's also a great comedy as there are many funny scenes where you giggle a lot with anything from Casey Affleck trying to act hard in front of his friends or Robin Williams making funny remarks about everything that surrounds him.   <br/><br/>I did feel very emotional towards the end but also uplifted and felt good about myself.   I was expecting someone to die in this as it is your typical ending for a story like this one. Though much to my delight Affleck and Damon kept there cool very well and bowed out with a more sombre end with one of the best lines in film for the last Decade said by Robin Williams when he reads the note that will left for him.<br/><br/>Affleck and Damon have more potential than you would think and I look forward to their next pairing as I heard they were getting together to write another script after a number of box office flops.  At least if they do we are pretty sure to get something special, so hurry up the both of you before people really turn against you and don't see you for the talent duo that you are."

Everything changes till he met Sean, a psychiatrist (Robin Williams). Matt Damon plays his role in a perfect way and he could be one of the better actors of these days as he plays the streetguy in a pure James dean/Marlon Brando-way, tons better than Affleck who seems a bit lost here.

There is a good sense of Boston as well.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is questionable as to any sense of consistent authenticity.  Antisocial behavior need not be a concomitant of genius, as other recent films about gifted but more or less detached characters seem to take for granted (as does this one).  Neither are saccharine catharses inevitable.  And the usually fine actor Stellan Skarsgard as the American professor with a French name and a Swedish accent seems miscast.  Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck with a passion, not unusual in a sense but hardly commendable in terms of his overblown popular persona.  One wonders indeed how he figures in real life as putative co-author of this fairly decent screenplay.<br/><br/>In short, there are some good moments and good lines -- and that is really what counts, even when the finished whole is less interesting or convincing than the finite parts.  Worth seeing.  7 of 10."

","Good story, excellent acting - especially by Matt Damon, really outdistancing all the others - and an awakener of many thoughts. Just one thing: what do geniuses say, really?<br/><br/>A script writer might need to be one, too, to get it right. This film leans heavily on learning, instead of wisdom, on wits instead of brilliance, on truisms instead of innovative perspectives. The actors do a great job in hiding this flaw, but there it is.<br/><br/>The nature of the genius has been explored since the romanticism of the early 19th century - I'm not sure the idea of such blessed humans was even around, before that. Maybe such people exist, and maybe not. In most cases, they have very specialized talents. Some have perfect memory, others excel at math. That does in no way make them better equipped for rhetoric or social skills. Thus, a genius can be a real idiot, outside that special field of competence.<br/><br/>Let's say that two brilliant persons sit down and have a very enlightened conversation with each other.

It's interesting that it's a film written by two childhood friends and that they made it big.  It's less interesting as a film, period.  Don't get me wrong; it's not really a BAD movie, it's just an average movie with nothing terribly surprising, innovative, or new, and it had a big reputation to live up to.  <br/><br/>The concept of a genius in janitors' clothing was new to me, and while it's refreshing to see a topic in a movie that hasn't been in a hundred movies before, the way the rest of the story played out was somewhat predictable. Didn't mean I didn't like it, just that I wasn't surprised by it.  I was expecting something a bit more surprising or shocking, and frankly the only thing shocking about this movie was the language.  Couldn't it have been made without quite so much profanity?<br/><br/>Some of the lines were quite a pleasure to watch -- especially Will's brainy monologues.  And the acting was all around quite good, especially by Minnie Driver and the two leading male characters (Matt Damon's Will and Ben Affleck's character).

These moments in the film is what makes it great.  These are the moments that allow the audience to glimpse what goes on in these character's minds.  Although there's no dialogue when Chuckie goes to Will's house near the end of the film, everyone knows what is going through his mind.

It was one of the happiest moments of my life when I saw Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Robin Williams accepting their Oscars. No one has ever deserved them more. I feel sorry for Minnie Driver though.

","On a shoe-string budget, with a less than well-known cast, Good Will Hunting once again proves you don't have to spend a lot of money in Hollywood to produce a first rate movie with a first rate ensemble cast.  Matt Damon (Will Hunting) and Ben Afleck are buddies who wrote the Oscar winning screenplay together.  Damon also garnered a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Minnie Driver (As Will's girlfriend Skylar) and Robin Williams (as Will's counselor Sean Maguire) were also nominated as Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively.  Both are superb in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>The plot concerns an MIT school janitor (Damon) from South Boston (""Southie"") who has a special gift when it comes to numbers. Rather than apply that skill, Will prefers hanging out with his childhood friends drinking, getting  into fights and carousing with women.  When Will completes a mathematics equation posted for the ""real"" students at MIT, a math professor becomes curious and tracks down Will. Seeing his potential, he takes Will under his wing. As a condition of his freedom (Will's arrested for assault), Will must undergo therapy.  After running through ""shrinks"" like women run through nylons, the professor seeks out his old college roommate (Sean), also a hard case and when Will and Sean finally begin to trust each other, things change for Will in his thoughts about his future and in his relationship with Driver.<br/><br/>Well-written, with a down to earth, realistic look at New England life, Good Will Hunting is a diamond in the rough.  With some of the best lines (had me laughing out loud) and well-crafted dialogue, this film soars above most of the movie fare. With a running time of 2:05, this film never drags and leaves you wanting more. For an uplifting, intelligent, thought-provoking and, most importantly, entertaining film, put Good Will Hunting at the top of your must see list."
"Howlord","10","1","4","23 April 2002"," An Important Movie For Me Personally
","My opinion of this movie will never be objective, and I suppose that's a fact I'll simply have to deal with when addressing its detractors.  The fact is, for me, this movie came along at a time when I really needed a movie to help me center myself.  I was struggling in school and fighting depression when this movie came out, and, after I saw this film, I felt like I would be able to cope with my life more.  The fact is, the movie simply spoke to where I was in my life.  I was letting people down, struggling and failing to meet the expectations of others and expecting constant failure, setting my personal goals in life lower than they should have been, letting my cynicism and self-hatred get in the way of pursuing my goals. <br/><br/>
I just loved everything about this movie from the clever dialogue to the interesting compilation soundtrack between Elliot Smith and Danny Elfman. The acting was top notch feeling real and unstaged, thanks in no small part to the fact that Affleck and Damon didn't hold back with the dialogue choosing a real conversational manner over moviespeak.  Though I am nowhere as smart as Will, I can appreciate his struggle with his own feelings of self-doubt and Matt Damon managed to get those feelings across without overplaying his hand.  I suppose more than anything else, this movie convinced me to try again, and for that I will always be grateful.  It helped me get where I got today through its hopeful, yet true message.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Geofbob","Null","1","4","29 December 2001"," Good quality, intelligent drama - isn't that enough?
","I can't really understand some of the adverse comment on this film; it may not be the best ever, but it's way above average. Basically, GWH is a classic (old-fashioned, if you like) character-driven drama, based on an improbable (and therefore interesting) but by no means impossible plot. It is to be welcomed as one of a seeming minority of Hollywood films, not centred on crime or violence, and/or loaded with SFX. But neither is it a smooth-edged fairytale. Director Gus Van Sant, working to a screenplay by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, has opted for a realistic context, especially when it comes to Will's roughneck pals. One result of this is the bad language, which apparently offends some viewers. (For the later, superficially similar, Finding Forrester, set in the Bronx, Van Sant seemed to take a more cautious route.)<br/><br/>Damon is excellent as the closet mathematical genius, Will Hunting, who prefers his delinquent lifestyle and the comradeship of his blue-collar buddies to possible academic acclaim. Once again, Robin Williams demonstrates that when cast in a grown-up role he can ditch most of his annoying mannerisms; his portrayal of Sean Maguire, a psychologist able to help others, but unable to help himself get over the death of his wife, is convincing and moving. Affleck as Will's best buddie, and Minnie Driver as Will's rich student girlfriend, have important supporting roles. Each character demonstrates a stage in what seems the main theme of the film - seeking, finding, and keeping hold of, yourself. <br/><br/>One weak spot is that the movie doesn't bring out clearly enough the conflict between Will's ""discoverer"" Prof Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) and Maguire. Lambeau wants Will to gain fame and fortune for the benefit of science (and his own kudos); Maguire is more interested in Will making his own choice, whatever that is. Those who think the film has a neat, happy ending should consider how Lambeau and Maguire will each view Will's action."

","By definition, most of us are fairly ordinary, but we seem to expect that people with marked ability should make the most of it. To use the biblical phrase, hiding one's talent under a bushell ( a brand of tea here in Australia) is a sin. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, better known as actors, put together the screenplay here which has to be regarded as a promising first attempt (they did get an Academy Award for it), but which is still rather uneven. There is some good dialogue and some very trite stuff,  the characters do not surprise or even develop much and the story is reliant on coincidence.<br/><br/>Will Hunting (Matt Damon), from working class South Boston, is a 20 year old janitor at MIT, who happens to have mathematical ability exceeding that of the professors, not to mention a photographic memory and a firm grasp of Western history and philosophy. Something of a coincidence? Strangely, he remains undiscovered until he is spotted by a professor solving on a blackboard a difficult problem set for students. Will has an attitude and a liking for thumping people (acquired it seems in his disturbed childhood) and is about to go to jail, but the prof intervenes and Will is let out on a bond provided he learns some maths and sees a counsellor. After a couple of false starts (to emphasise just what a difficult little b'stard Will is), Robin Williams hoves into view as the counsellor, Maguire. The rest of the story concerns Dr Maguire's attempts to help Will sort out his problems, which become more complicated when he become involved with English medical student Minnie Driver (called Skylab or something).<br/><br/>Both Matt Damon (nearly B A Harvard) and Ben Affleck (his childhood friend in Cambridge, Mass.) have middle class backgrounds and it was no doubt a bit of a challenge for them to write a script  about someone like Will. It would have been very interesting if someone really from a poor Boston background like Mark Wahlberg had done it. Will is sensitively realised and we see that it is difficult for someone with his fractured upbringing to have much self-worth. Yet no-one with a brain like his lacks an ego and I couldn't help thinking he wouldn't need Robin Williams to discover it for him.<br/><br/>
I thought the most intriguing character in the film was Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), the MIT maths professor who discovers Will. Even though Lambeau has won the maths equivalent of the Nobel Prize, Will can still out-prove him, if that's the word. He is jealous, but he also is determined that Will succeed. He needs to believe Will is like him in that he must be pushed to succeed. Then Lambeau can tell himself if he had been pushed even harder he might have reached Will's level. At least then he will get some of the credit.<br/><br/>I had Gus Van Sant down as a rather odd-ball director with a gay sensibility (`My  Own Private Idaho', `Even Cowgirls Get the Blues') though he got a bit more mainsteam in `The Rainmaker' (also with Matt Damon). This is a very nice ordinary quiet mainstream picture with a few good moments. Van Sant has since revisited the topic of nurturing genius (literary this time) in `Forrester'. This earlier effort is more effective because the Will character is a kind of Mozart of math, with God-given ability, and it's hard not to root for him, whereas the protagonist in `Forrester' is a cultural product, albeit black and from the slums. With his beefy glower, Matt Damon looks right and  projects Will's hostility well while Robin Williams turns down the volume and puts in a restrained, almost elegant performance. You could rent worse for a quiet, cerebral, Friday night."

Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, it is always nice to see him doing something heartfelt, showing that he is a true actor, not just a clown. Minnie Driver was very good also. All of the roles seemed well written. The writing of the film is perfection. It allows us tp feel sorry for someone who could seem very unforgiving for all the pain he brings people. Also, it allows us  to see both sides of the story. I sympathized with Will, I think if he didn't want to ""Explain things to people my whole life"" then that is what he wants and should be aloud to do what  he wants. I also understood where the professor was coming from, he just didn't want to see Will throw his life away.<br/><br/>     It is a very good film and I recomend it to all. 9.5/10"

This is what I think separates descent movies from the really special ones.  This is what enables me to really submerge myself into the story.  Everyone has certain movies that they can watch over and over and never get tired of.  Good Will Hunting is one of those movies that I find to get better each time I watch it.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with fabulous stimulating dialogue between interesting, yet real-to-life characters.  Matt Damon gives one of my favorite performances on film to date.  He portrays Will Hunting, a genius whose tough on the outside but scared on the inside personality will keep him from finding true happiness or realizing his full potential until he is able to escape his past and learn how to trust again.  Robin Williams also gives an outstanding performance as the shrink who tries to help him do that, and learns a little bit about life himself.  If you just took the scenes between these two characters to make this movie it would have still been excellent. But this movie has so much more to offer.  There is the relationship with Skylar, played by Minnie Driver who has everything Will has ever looked for in a girl.  There are his buddies who he has grown up with his whole life, including his best friend Chuckie, played by Ben Affleck.  There is Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, who is one of the smartest mathematicians in the world, and yet his knowledge and ability does not even compare to young Will Hunting.<br/><br/>All of this adds up to one of the most entertaining and thought provoking movies out there.

Will doesn't know how to guide his capability in a productive way, but after a mathematics teacher discovers the boy's potential, he decides to take him to Sean McGuire( Robin Willians,  who wrongly robbed Burt Reynolds' statue in the Oscar night), a hard, intelligent but sensitive psychologist, who has just lost his wife. The two end up building a true friendship, based on trust, and Will will have to evaluate his life and  choose among continuing to go on with his simple life or to open himself for the brilliant future that waits for him... Matt Damon, a young actor, wrote this excellent drama's plot,together with his friend Ben Affleck. In the hands of director Gus Van Sant, ""Good Will Hunting"" stayed faithful to the original ideas of the young stars, and it consecrated them as two great promises,due to their latent talent and charisma. Robin Willians gives a contained and thrilling interpretation ,building with effectiveness  a psychologist full of sorrow who, slowly, rediscovers the pleasure that life offers for those who want to get it. Actress Minnie Driver is excellent, portraying the girl who falls in love with Will and tries to make the boy surrender to the love! Gus Van Sant tried to avoid the exaggerations that marked his previous films, and he conducted with professionalism and talent a great film that teaches us something:for more difficult than life sometimes is is, if we count with values such as friendship, love, trust and pardon, is still possible to ennoble the world.

","""Good Will Hunting"" is not one of those conventional Hollywood dramas that are filled with sentimental moments, melodramatic situations and stereotypical characters. It is a film that  focuses on realistic characters, their complex lives and the things life has to give them, whether they want them or not. Something every human being can relate too. ""Good Will Hunting"" is a genuinely good film, that has qualities I consider a rarity these days in movies. This may sound over the top, but this movie will most likely be one of the most memorable dramas of the 90`s.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck`s honest and invigorating script transfers almost perfectly onto the big screen, with the help of director Gus Van Sant. ""Good Will Hunting"" is about a young, cocky but deeply troubled young man named Will Hunting. He lives in South Boston with his street bum friends, but there`s something that separates him from the rest; He`s a genius. After an MIT professor accidentally discovers his gift, Will`s life starts to change, more dramatically than he thinks. Two strangers almost simultaneously then enter Will`s life; Sean Maguire, a widowed psychologist who tries to help Will, played greatly by Robin Williams. And Skylar (played equally as good by Minnie Driver), a vibrant Harvard student who quickly falls in love with Will. Will`s relationship with both them and his blue-collar friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), all seem to deeply affect him, making it more difficult for Will to realise what he truly needs. The ending of the film sort of leaves you hanging, but you will no doubt me moved. ""Good Will Hunting"" is pretty down-to-earth film, but it is enriched with an indescribable power that is probably generated by all the exceptional performances, the script and Gus Van Sant`s unparalleled direction. A satisfying, powerful and thought-provoking movie."

He easily reduces a Harvard student to an embarrassed school boy by citing the exact sources of the student's knowledge, telling him what he'd be reading the next year, then topping it off by offering to ""take it outside.""<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, it continuously shows a math professor pushing Will to use his natural talent to become something he's simply not interested in. After all, he's still young, and he has a lot to learn and a lot of his past life to sort out in his mind.<br/><br/>Sean (Robin Williams) sees through all of this and helps Will out. The emotional element of this movie hinges heavily on this relationship and is very captivating. Likeable characters and a good story make this a 10 for sure. (watch out for the tears!)"
"Shaf-2","10","1","4","4 August 1998"," A spectacular achievement of screenwriting and acting
","Those who call Good Will Hunting ""predictable"" are missing the point.  This is a movie that shines on dialogue, both comedic and dramatic, that is written and delivered with a poetic flair.  The humorous sequences will have you laughing out loud (I especially liked the ""Sandwich purchased on lay-away"" bit), and the drama will hit you like a punch to the stomach.  Suspension of disbelief was immediate, even with the premise, and it held me inthralled throughout its length.  Sure, the ending is predictable, but it's the journey, and not the destination, that made Good Will Hunting the best film of 1997."

","I Love Robin Williams, and since this is usually regarded as his best performance I thought I would love this movie. It was awful. Williams is good but is given to little screen time, and all he does is talk about his wife. He was much better in Fisher King and Dead Poets Society. All the dialogue and everything that happens in this movie is incredibly unrealistic. Also the characters feel inauthentic."

","I really liked the movie because it was so true. Everything wasn't perfect like in a fairy tale, people had problems with love, friendship and other things in life just like it is in the real world. It contained interesting characters and the actors were great. The plot was very interesting and fun. For being the first movie Matt Damon and Ben Affleck ever wrote it was mind-blowing. I sure would never be able to pull of something that good as a first time writer.<br/><br/>In my interpretation of this movie its message is that your childhood means more to your future than you think and even if you grow up to be in a certain way, it is never to late to change. That is an important lesson in life. <br/><br/>The best scene in the move according to me was the one when Will meets Skylar for the very first time, in the Harvard bar. I think it is very funny when Will arrived and rescued Chuckie from a conversation in which he had not a clue what he was talking about. At the same time, he impressed Skylar and made her interested in go out with him. <br/><br/>The theme of this movie is a mix of human relationships, love, fear, social problems and friendship.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet i would certainly recommend you to do it. <br/><br/>I give it 10 out of 10 points"
"samanthas-45-119570","10","1","5","25 September 2014"," The best movie I've ever seen
","This movie hits it out of the ballpark for me. First off all, the script is absolutely incredible. Affleck and Damon have written an amazing story that compares to no other and really tugs at your heartstrings without, in any way, being soppy, gushy, or unrealistic. Yes, there is a lot of profanity, but that is real life! People swear! If you look past the four-letter-words, you'll be able to see all this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>The acting is also incredible. Robin Williams was stunning in his performance as Sean. I had never seen him do a serious role before I saw this film, and he blew me away with his talent. Matt Damon also shines.<br/><br/>The movie is completely compelling and absolutely beautiful. And, I don't often cry during movies, but the scene where Will breaks down crying in Will's arms really gets me. Honestly, it's my favorite scene I've ever seen in any movie."
"anthonymora2","9","1","5","22 September 2014"," Good Will Hunting Review
","Every now and then I like to step away from reviewing a new theatrical or Blu-ray release and talk about movies that have already been out for some time now.I,as I'm sure the rest of the world,am still deeply hurt to hear about the tragic death of Robin Williams.So I wanna share my opinions on one of his most celebrated movies and movie roles in Good Will Hunting. William Hunting is a young,South Boston raised punk who works as a janitor at M.I.T.Ironically,despite being ""just a janitor"",Will can solve math equations that baffle even the school's top professors.After anonymously solving a nearly impossible math problem posted in the school halls,he gets the attention of one of the school math professors. With the teachings of Prof. Lamdeau,played by Skarsgard,and regular therapy visits with a community college psychology professor,Will gets the opportunity to really show just what his young brain is capable of while also finding a person he can open up and connect to in, Dr. Sean Macguire played flawlessly by the late,Robin Williams. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck both won Oscars for their screenplay of this movie back when it released and believe me when I say that this movie's script is one of the best in film in my opinion.I know that's a stretch but every character conversation,no matter what the mood of the scene,is filled with interesting and important dialog.I literally won't watch this movie with out subtitles just because I don't wanna risk missing an important piece of info or some character development.There are scenes in this movie that can bring me tears with either sadness or hilarity,this is definitely a layered movie.All this makes the story that much more believable and that of course makes for extremely likable and developed characters.Seriously even minor characters have their moments throughout. With these great characters,you definitely get great performances.Matt Damon is as good as I've ever seen him,he has these one takes where he goes on and on spewing out all this mind numbing but intriguing dialog.Ben Affleck is in this one,however he really plays the secondary character here.That doesn't mean he doesn't get a few good scenes here and there,I actually liked his character as well.Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard both give really good supporting performances as well.As for Mr.Williams,I really don't have to say anything.What more need be said by now,you know? His performance in this movie puts you through so many different emotions as does his character and it works SO effectively,he's perfect! The music by Danny Elfman is subtle but really kicks when it has to and the cinematography is also actually very good after I rewatched this on Blu-ray.Gus Van Sant may not be a houshold name but he really has this way of making the movie seem almost like a documentary sometimes,he brings realism to his films and a lot of welcomed depth to his characters. With this review I'd like to say one last goodbye to my childhood hero,Robin Williams and praise his performance as well as this film that still gets me Every time!You can call it a sympathy rating but I cant help but give this movie a perfect 10/10 because its MY review and despite the circumstances,this is really a GREAT film and I love it.Of course I give GOOD WILL HUNTING MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. BUY THIS MOVIE!"
"WinstonDeloney","10","1","5","17 September 2014"," One of the Best Movies Ever Made
","This is personally, my favorite movie ever. It contains everything you've ever wanted in a film, from great character development, amazing dialog, funny scenes, beautiful cinematography, and impactive moments. <br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a genius from the south side of Boston who spends the majority of his time hanging out with his degenerate group of friends who get into fights among other things. He is picked up by a professor who recognizes his genius, and is sent to work with Robin Williams in order to get his mental state up to a good level. After conflict and resolution, Damon and Williams end up working together and everyone is happy.<br/><br/>The reason I love this so movie so much is because of the range of emotion displayed throughout. The scene in the park makes me cry every time, and I am not ashamed to say it.<br/><br/>You really have to go check out the movie if you haven't already."
"PWNYCNY","10","1","5","15 September 2014"," Psychiatrist as hero.
","This is an intense movie and includes many strong performances, capped off by Robin Williams's, which is probably the best cinema performance of his career. The movie deals with a lot of social and psychological themes - denial, repression, social marginalization, self-esteem, love - without becoming corny or a spoof. That is, the story can be taken seriously, and for Hollywood, which has a track record of reducing event he most complicated issues to the most simplistic level, this is a major accomplishment. The title character, Will, played admirably by Matt Damon, really serves as a metaphor for every person unable to actual their potential. Minnie Driver's performance is especially powerful, but this is Robin Williams's movie. His performance as the treating psychiatrist who is able to break through Will's resistance and defenses may be the positive portrayal of a mental health therapist in cinema history. This movie should be watched by anyone who is interested in mental health and by the public in general because this movie is about us."
"georgeh1981","10","1","5","14 October 2006"," Truly fantastic Movie
","Not only is the premise very interesting, but Gus Van Sant's use of lighting in this movie is incredible. The screenplay is superb (it won best original screenplay ), and the acting is awesome. I have seen this movie at least 15 times and I love it more every time. <br/><br/>The fact that Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Houser, Minnie Driver, and Robin Williams all launched serious acting careers from this movie, is impressive. (Williams had already done a lot of work, but GWH was the film that really gave him the respect he deserves as a serious actor). I have been to Boston 3 times since watching this movie, and each time, I visit Southie (the Irish neighborhood Will is from), the Harvard Bar (Broken Arrow, the exterior shot of the ""Haaa ved Baa"" scene), and Bunker Hill C.C., (the Community College Robin Williams teaches at), in honor of this movie. Truly a classic, that you will watch time and time again."
"Nimbo","10","1","5","22 February 1999"," Just superb in every sense of the word
","I tell you this. 'Good Will Hunting' will be one of my all time favorites. I enjoy seeing homage to extreme intelligence. The truly gifted are such a rare commodity. And most of them do have problems, such as relating to others. Seeing Will drive off into the sunset to Stanford, California and the one woman in his life who truly is his other half, what a clincher and a perfect ending to a magnificent movie. Love pays off. The only reason for living. And the final restrained rapport between Matt and Robin proves that intimacy need not be sensual. What a movie!!!"

He wears the same blank expression all through the movie.  Everybody else around him are great and they really carry the show.  <br/><br/>Some people have criticized the movie for its frequent profanity, but that's how guys from South Boston talk.  Also Affleck and Damon were born and raised in Cambridge so they have authentic Boston accents.  It helps the tone of the film immensely.<br/><br/>So, it's a very very good film.  It could have been great with a better leading man.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing...except for Damon.  Concentrate on everything else."
"Mark Harrison","7","1","7","1 August 2005"," Why do Hollywood actresses do British characters so badly
","First I want to say that I thought the movie was quite good, in fact I gave it a 7. Why only a 7? Well I judge by the standards of movies I have seen and I travel a lot. Its not really as fantastic as 'Unbearable Lightness of Being' or 'Moscow does not believe in tears', but that is the price we pay for living in a society where Hollywood hype dictates what people go and see. Audiences rave about the sizzle and not the steak, which I feel is the case with many reviews here. Not only this film.<br/><br/>One irritation I would like to comment on is why o why when Hollywood actors do a British character they ruin it by Americanizing their speech. Minnie Driver's character says 'guy' all the time not 'bloke' as a British girl would. Here's a wake up call for Americans: Hollywood is condescending to you! Yes, they think you are so thick (sorry dumb) that you will not understand unless a British character says fries and not chips. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, it makes us squirm in our seat and detracts from what would otherwise be a very good film. A further note on language, I am not sure what kind of people producers mix with, but my friends from University don't use obscenities in every sentence and I went to an Ivy league University. This comes over as sensation seeking and cheap and again it detracts from the impact of the film in my view."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","1","7","28 May 2005"," Impressive, if just a bit predictable
","This is the writing debut of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yep. They wrote this movie. I had a hard time believing it when I read it, too. Something that made it easier to believe what that I read in the trivia section that they originally wrote it as more of a Hollywood-like film, with government conspiracies and such. Luckily, they were advised to drop everything but the core drama. The result is this very interesting and thoroughly entertaining film. The story of one young man with vast, unused talent. Like many other dramas, this is based primarily in the dialog and the characters. Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where you see the interaction, the conversations between Damon and Williams. They play off each other very nicely. Gus Van Sant's fairly vague and undistinguished directorial style fits the story well, and I really enjoyed the usage of the cameras in the fight scene early in the film. The film has plenty of clever writing, mainly noticeable in the dialog. The plot is very good. The pacing is mostly good, though the film gets a tad slow every once in a while. Near the end I felt like it could have been shorter without hurting the film. The acting is all top-notch, though some of the dialects could have used a bit more work. Something that bothered me a bit about the end was how inconclusive and yet Hollywood-like it was. We don't really know what happens to Will Hunting after the film... but we get the feeling that he's going to be fine. I prefer the ending to 8 Mile, which was a good bit more ambiguous. In the end, a pretty good writing debut, and a solid directing effort by Van Sant. I recommend this to fans of dramas and the various names involved in it. 8/10"
"Travis_Bickle01","9","1","8","30 October 2005"," Now that's what I call acting!
","I think this might probably be the best movie of the late '90's. The screenplay is wonderfully written by Damon and Affleck. It is really touching and the acting performances are high class. Robin Williams plays one of his best roles in years, although I always love his movies. They couldn't have found any actor more suitable for this role. It's actually a shame he had to wait such a long time until he won his first Academy Award.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is also surprisingly good as the rebellious but very clever Will Hunting. ""The Rainmaker"", ""The Talented Mr Ripley"", the Jason Bourne-movies... are all excellent movies where Damon gives very nice performances as well, but in these movies he never reaches the same level of acting as in ""Good Will Hunting"". Truly amazing! The movie is also filled with many beautiful and touching moments, but I will only mention the ones I loved the most. The scene where Damon and Williams meet for the first time and where Damon starts analyzing Williams and his life is breathtaking. It's unbelievable how such a young man with such a strong personally can totally break a man in a few minutes. My favourite scene is without any doubt the scene with Williams and Damon on the bench, where Williams tells about his life, his wife and her disease and death, where he tells Damon that he's just a kid, not knowing where he's talking about because he's afraid of loving someone more them himself. Where he also says that Damon cannot understand who he is and what he has been through, just because he saw his painting; that he cannot understand where Damon has been through either, just because he might have read Oliver Twist...This scene is certainly in my personal Top10 of Best Scenes ever.<br/><br/>This movie is a real classic. Some people might find it too sentimental and my too optimistic as well, but for me he is certainly one of my Top10 movies of all time. This was the second time I saw ""Good Will Hunting"" and I'm sure I will see him many other times after this.<br/><br/>Top class! **** out of ****"
"TxMike","Null","1","8","7 July 2000"," A real masterpiece, better on the second and third viewing.
","I watched ""Good Will Hunting"" again last night, at least a year after my initial viewing. This time, I knew how the stories would be resolved, and I was able to more clearly see the brilliance in both the story-telling and the movie-making. And to think the screenplay was written by Affleck and Damon is truly amazing in its own right. I rate this a very strong ""9"" and it certainly deserves to be in any top list of movies all-time.<br/><br/>To those several hundred of you who rated this movie a ""1"", I just have one thing to say - all of you are truly movie idiots, and wouldn't know a good movie if you actually saw one."
"lee_eisenberg","8","1","9","13 February 2006"," Well done, but ""Finding Forrester"" was even better.
","I would have given ""Good Will Hunting"" 10/10, but ""Finding Forrester"" outdid it (now ""GWH"" almost seems self-indulgent). The plot of course has the title character (Matt Damon) finding his way in life with the help of Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Stellan Skarsgard also do quite well in their roles. I'll never forget Williams's comment when he accepted his Oscar (""Thank you Ben and Matt. I still want to see some ID."") Like so many other movies (pretty much every one except the illogical ""Gerry""), this certainly shows Gus Van Sant to be a great director. If this movie had any bad sides, it was that it paved the way for Ben Affleck starring in ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" (not to mention the whole ""Ben and Jen"" thing; thank God that's over with)."
"shemyrushmoremax","10","1","9","19 July 2005"," Such a relatable and emotional story
","I was sitting at home one day, and saw an ad for Good Will Hunting on TV. It was a movie that I had wanted to see for years, but never had the time to, so I got up still in my sleep clothes, grabbed my keys, walked outside, got in my car, and drove up to the video store. There was only one copy of it there, I asked the guy why so little, and his reply is,'People just usually steal it.' I thought that was sorta unusual considering that if you were gonna steal a tape from a video store, it'd Clerks, but I still hadn't seen it yet. So, I got home, poured out some nasquick, got some pop tarts, and popped in the tape, and sat down to watch it. During the film, I found myself on the brink of tears. The movie just hit so deep. The janitor that comes off as being some mischievous, beer guzzlin' guy, but is revealed as a brilliant person who has had a troubled past. Being an orphan. Being beaten as a children. Going from foster parent, to foster parent only to find more people that could pummel him. Then, he mets the therapist who can actually connect with him, and not just be another school counselor. This movie is just so emotional, and understandable that it just makes you think about life, and everything it's worth. It displays magnificent writing from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, and amazing filming from Gus Van Sant. It is definitely a movie that one should rent or buy if they have not already witnessed its greatness."
"anaghadeshpande2002","8","1","9","25 June 2005"," Fantastic, thats it !
","The movie is an ultimate piece of drama. All of the cast has done an excellent job and Matt Demon and Robin Williams deserve all the kudos. Matt has portrayed a cocky genius and he seems to be born for the role. So is Robin Williams. The movie is absolutely immaculate except for one technical error that Will (Matt Demon) introduces Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck) as his brother to Skylar (Minnie Driver) and she believes the lie. If you have seen the movie fairly attentively(which you are compelled to - its so encapsulating), you must have noticed that when Will first meets skylar in a club, Chuckie is also with him and when Will gets into an argument with the pompous guy (I am not sure what his name is) on history knowledge, Skylar is present right there in the scene. Will says to the guy something like ""You are trying to impress some girls and embarrass my FRIEND"". Now if I was Skylar and I was as brainy as her (she is shown to be quiet a brainy person - at least thats what i feel), I would not have forgotten that Chuckie is Will's friend and would not have fooled by the lie which Will tells her later and introduces Chuckie as his brother.<br/><br/>But this critical evaluation is uncalled for as this is not a mystery where all the events should concatenate properly. The movie is just superb and is a must see for everyone. It reveals Will's character (of a prodigy who does not like to be vulnerable to anything) with tremendous success and deserves the rating IMDb has given it."
"KnightLander","8","1","9","20 June 2005"," Deserves much more credit than it gets
","I avoided seeing ""Good Will Hunting"" for years due to its reputation as a ""bad pic disguised as an Indie flick"". Then, one night, I decided to try it. How bad could it be? If it was awful, I figured, at least with Affleck it oughta be funny (in an unintentional way).<br/><br/>But guess what? It wasn't funny. It wasn't bad. In fact, it was pretty near great.<br/><br/>The story has been done before, albeit in slightly different form, so don't look for anything too special here. Young Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is, secretly, a mathematical genius, who puts out a rebellious attitude to disguise this. While working as a janitor, his talent is discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard), and from there Will's life is changed forever. He meets his dream girl (Minnie Driver) and undergoes psychological therapy in an attempt to fix up his attitude. The only shrink who has any chance with Will, however, is another college professor: Sean Maguire, played by Robin Williams. Along with his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will embarks on a journey that will change his life forever.<br/><br/>Damon and Affleck, at the time relatively new to film-making, grabbed an Academy Award for ""Best Original Screenplay"" for writing the tale of ""Good Will Hunting"". Williams also received an Academy Award for ""Best Supporting Actor"", and the film was nominated for seven other awards including ""Best Picture"". The cast is terrific here - even Affleck isn't horrible - but it's Damon and Williams whose performances really reach out and grab you.<br/><br/>Someone who should have won an Oscar was director Gus Van Sant. His unique directing style gets moving performances from the entire cast and really brings to life Damon and Affleck's otherwise ordinary script. There's also a not-so-remarkable score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>I find this film to be severely underrated. If you give it a small chance, it will really have an effect on you. ""Good Will Hunting"" is one of the best films of the year, a shlock flick turned into a touching wonder. This movie really deserves much more credit than it gets."
"jboothmillard","7","1","16","7 September 2005"," Good Will Hunting
","Written by best friends and stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and winning Oscars and Golden Globes for doing so, this is a pretty good drama, from Oscar nominated director Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy, To Die For, Psycho). Basically Will Hunting (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated (for actor) Damon) is a lowly janitor at a South Boston college, a bit of a rebel with his friends, including Chuckie Sullivan (Affleck) and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck, Ben's brother), and hides a genius talent for memorising facts and solving/proving sophisticated mathematical theorems. It is when Will is facing imprisonment (for attacking a youth and a police officer) that he gets the chance to prove himself for Gerald Lambeau (Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsg√•rd). Will can either go to jail, or he can be supervised by Lambeau solving maths theorems, and see a therapist, which he disapproves of and believes he doesn't need, and manages to get rid of eight. Lambeau in desperation calls old college friend, now psychologist Sean Maguire (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Robin Williams), and after their first meeting, Sean is determined to connect with Will and his hostile, sarcastic defence mechanisms. It is after Sean strikes Will with his story of giving up his ticket to the Red Sox in the 1975 World Series (thus missing Carlton Fisk's famous home run in Game 6), instead to find a girl. This encourages Will to try and have a relationship with Skylar (Oscar nominated Minnie Driver). In the end, after quite a lot of bickering with Sean, Lambeau, and Skylar moving to California, Will sees the error of ways, gives up a job he could have got, and sends Sean a thank you note, saying he's going to ""get a girl"". Also starring John Mighton as Tom, Rachel Majorowski as Krystyn, Colleen McCauley as Cathy and The Cave's Cole Hauser as Billy. Damon became a star and obviously became Jason Bourne, Affleck is pretty good as Will's best friend, Skarsg√•rd does pretty well as the teacher, and Driver is good as the English girlfriend, and of course, Williams deserved his Oscar for his subtle performance. It was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Danny Elfman, Best Song for ""Miss Misery"" and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!"

The brilliance of this story is the bond he gets with psychiatrist Robin Williams, who for the first time ever, teaches the vulnerable Matt Damon how to really love someone...May sound corny, but it definitely isnt. This is a blokes movie, which women would love as well.<br/><br/>What a brilliant coming of age tale! Just so profoundly touching, that I got all teary eyed at the end and I am not quickly moved by a movie whatsoever. It is not cheesy or sentimental though.

","Good Will Hunting came out in 1997 and tells the story of a remarkable young man played by Matt Damon who hangs around with the wrong crowd as he came out of foster. When Will works as a janitor he does a math sum which impresses one of the teachers at the school played by Stellan Skarsgard. But when Will is up for probation after beating a guy in the yard he gets help from a physicatrist played by Robin Williams (who won an Oscar for his portrayal as Sean Maguire) who tries to talk sense with Will.

","I saw this movie 2 years ago so maybe I'm not in the right position to write about it. Truth is I remember a few things about what happened in this film. The story didn't work right for me. I felt like I was watching another film with Robin Williams who was playing the same role over and over again. For another time Williams was playing the good man of the story. Sure he did an excellent performance but its unfortunate that we didn't see this actor play a wide variety of roles before leaving this world for good. Mat Damon is an actor who I can't go along with him in almost any movie he ever played. Same goes with Ben Affleck. Their performances were ok for me but not Oscaw worthy. Same goes with the screenplay. Gus Van Sant did an alright work but nothing out of the ordinary at least for today. I don't know maybe this movie was a success because of it's time but nowadays it seems obsolete. Yes it has good dialogue and some awesome quotes and the ending is leaving you with a bittersweet taste in your mouth but I myself couldn't delve into the film's world. Now you can find a million of movies like this one. I know that it's a movie that inspired almost every other movie of this genre but still I can't consider it a masterpiece. A good movie but nothing out of the ordinary at least for me."

","Minnie Driver, who played the role Skylar. An absolutely miscast. She was totally out of place in this film. For Will Hunting, played the role by Matt Damon, she's too old, too BIG and even got moustache. I've never heard any young female actor whose laughters so terrible, sounded more like an old hag, so repellent and so disgusting. Her British accent also felt so out of place in this film. Every scene involved her image was simply too painful to watch. Just horrible a viewing experience. If there's some kind technique that I could wipe or block out her images in this film, it would be perfect. Her KAKAKA weird old witch-like laughter haunted me and gave me nightmares, man. <br/><br/>How could she pass the audition, signed up for this Skyler character? Don't say ""It's not your fault!"""

All in all, the movie consists of an outstanding cast with interesting roles, a high entertainment value in the plot, and last but not least, an interesting period of time in an interesting part of the USA.

"eternalxv","8","0","1","4 February 2018"," Great spin on the hidden genius premise.
","Matt Damon as Will and Ben Affleck as Chuckie fit into my visualization of the stereotypical young adult male from Boston in the 90's. The fact that the two were both raised in Massachusetts makes me smile a little when I realize they are most likely playing a version of themselves from the past but with that said I couldn't have enjoyed this movie more. I assumed far too much about this film just based on the quick synopsis I had read beforehand. Will being the problem child/genius was not quite what I was expecting. Typically these type of characters are written to be a sort of incredibly anti-social recluse, where as Will just received a really bad roll of the dice and grew up with little to no positive guidance and instead used his brilliance to skirt the law and impress his friends.
 The introduction of Robyn Williams' character, Sean, was the perfect addition to balance out Will's reckless nature. Sean's heartfelt approach to therapy is something that should be taken considered by real mental health professionals and Robin William's personality shines through perfectly as a foul-mouthed man that has experienced a world full of struggle and pain. A more exceptional match for a young Will has entered the building, the rest can go home.
This film uses an impressive amount of close-up camera angles as a way to transition through dialogue which acts as a way to keep the viewer engaged and aware of the emotions on the characters faces. This fits perfectly with the emotional impact that Will and Sean's interactions have. What an amazing film, I will be watching this one a second time."
"lyndecreviston","10","0","1","1 February 2018"," Very inspirational movie
","Good Will Hunting is a story about a young man who is struggling to find himself. Will, Played by Matt Damon was raised in foster homes and finds himself on the wrong side of the law after an assault charge on an officer finds himself working as a janitor per the court orders instead of serving time. Will finds himself sweeping the hallways of MIT where he sees mathematical equations scribbled on a dry erase board for one of the classes. Will, solves the problem with ease and is recognized by Professor Lambeau played by Stellan Skarsgard. Will is then sent on a roller coaster ride of finding love, trusting his therapist Sean, played by Robin Williams, and not leaving his friends behind who have been the only loyal people in his life. 
The theme of this movie is trying to find yourself. Will was raised by the state and was in foster homes most of his life. He lived a hard life and never played by the rules, in fact, Will usually made his own rules. Wills friends were the only sense of family he ever had so trusting others, especially adults, was not going to happen. Will finds himself in trouble with the law after an assault on an officer earns him a deferred prosecution becomes a janitor at MIT. Will comes across as just a product of his environment and nobody could predict the genius that was hiding behind his thick walls. Will becomes a client of a therapist that little beknown to him came from a very similar background. Sean, played by Robin Williams, digs deep to the inner core of Will trying to help him find the true person he was meant to be. Sean is there for Will and teaches him that not everyone he encounters has a set motive. Sean spends a lot of time during their therapy sessions talking about his own life to try to gain the trust of Will. All Will has ever known was this town and his friends that he grew up with. When a girl named Skylar comes into his life he initially pushes her away and breaks up with her before she can hurt him.
Nobody expects Will to be so smart based on his upbringing. Professor Lambeau even stated that Will just ""got lucky"" solving his math problem. There is a special bond that is built between Will and Sean and he finally starts to let his guards down when they are comparing the beatings that they used to take from the hands of their fathers.
In the end the biggest scene that gets stuck in my head was Will and Sean's last session when Will overhears Sean arguing with Professor Lambeau regarding Will's future. I think this is the first time Will has ever experienced somebody sticking up for him. Will enters the room and it is just him and Sean and Sean tells him, ""it's not your fault"". At first Will is a little skeptical but Sean keeps repeating it until the final wall that Will has built breaks and he breaks down in Sean's arms. Will then decides to take the biggest risk he has ever taken, leave the only town he has ever known and all of his friends to ""go see about a girl"". 
Another movie that compares to Good Will Hunting in my eyes would be Stand By Me. This movie was produced in 1986 directed by Rob Reiner but follows the theme of finding yourself. This one is not just one boy trying to find himself but 4 boys that grew up as friends but had 4 completely different backgrounds that had to overcome obstacles of bullies and just being treated differently by others."

The portrayal of Will Hunting is just so REAL, I am sure that many people are related to his personality and character, and so do I. For those who has a bad past in their life, and became more defensive and always pretending that you are a strong and complete person, please watch this movie.

","The script of this film is of course easy to be in awe of as it won it's Oscar, deservedly so, and showered movie critics with something to obsess over. So I'm going to hop on the bandwagon and share my thoughts<br/><br/>The seeming simplicity of the script has the ability to tear down walls of the human psyche and easily connect movie goers to the personal hardships the main characters face. Through realistic and unrealistic life conditions like Will's (Matt Damon) uncanny ability to solve high standard math problems and literally recite books with his photographic memory, the audience fills in the missing real life examples of suffering with their own. Through doing this, as Will solves his personal problems and comes to a self realization, so does the audience. The incredible nature of the script works it's magic like this throughout the remainder of the movie. <br/><br/>The excellency of the chemistry between the cast allows them to deliver the words of the script with pure emotion. The real life relationship of the aforementioned Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, playing Chuckie, is seen throughout the course of the film as they settled their differences and similarities after coming through self realization in order to maintain their loving friendship. Casey Affleck, playing Morgan, and Cole Hauser, playing Billy, perfectly top the troubled relationships in the movie. Skylar (Minnie Driver) and Sean (Robin Williams) play back and forth roles in manipulating Will into believing what is best for him.<br/><br/>All in all, the script is what the architecture of this movie is built around and the accompanying parts accent it amazingly well. Good Will Hunting may not check the boxes off perfectly but the scattered feelings of the characters, the real world comparisons that can be made, and of course the detailed yet facile script easily allow audiences to connect with the movie. And that in its own should be the main goal of movies, to draw their watchers into the place of the characters and experience the movie in it's entirety."

","I was postponing watching this movie as i thought it wouldn't be so incredible, but contrary to what i expected this movie is one of the greatest that I've ever watched. *This part may contain some spoilers* Will, the orphan genius who had a childhood problems because of his adoptive alcoholic father who's apparently used to kinda torture him, he appeared to have fear of abandonment issues due to the fact that he was abandoned from one of his parents which later affected his personality and made him defensive and a bit aggressive. Despite all of this psychological problems, Will appeared to have a brilliant mind in all fields and not only math. Later in some event in the movie Will sees a guy who he appeared to have some old nursery problems with, Will decided to take revenge, which reflects that his personality is really affected by some memories from the past. He gets arrested and thanks to that he meets the professor who wants to make Will take advantage of his brilliant mind. But to make him do that will had to see a therapist to get rid of his ""aggressive personality"" first. A bunch of therapist failed to communicate with Will due to the fact that he is the one who analyzes their personalities and not the opposite. But prof Gerald knew the one who could communicate with Will and make him reveal what's inside his heart, an old friend called Sean, who later became a close friend of Will's. I really enjoyed every moment of this movie, brilliant story, excellent acting, and a wonderful sequence of events."

"classicsoncall","10","0","1","15 November 2017"," ""So what do you really wanna do?""
","For a couple of guys in their Twenties, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck brought a lot of insight into their screenplay treatment for ""Good Will Hunting"". Especially good is the dialog that occurs between Will (Damon) and therapist Sean (Robin Williams) in their various exchanges that span the confrontational to the healing. You have to wonder where those nuggets of wisdom came from for the characters to deal with each other in such a credible fashion.<br/><br/>I think a lot of viewers, particularly male, can relate to Will's seeming lack of direction; personally, my own period of existential angst occurred right about the same time Will was dealing with his. My only trouble was that I wasn't as brilliant as the character portrayed by Damon, his was a one in a million intellect that could see solutions to mathematical problems that someone like myself would fail to comprehend. Perhaps the overarching problem one faces is unless you have a passion about a certain thing, then how do you know what kind of career to pursue or who the right person is to establish a lifetime commitment with. I'm sure a lot of people never figure it out.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie a couple of times in the past, but my viewing the other day was kind of significant in an odd way concerning guys like Ben Affleck and brother Casey. It has to be embarrassing for Affleck to see himself now in a film where he's such an insensitive jerk when it comes to women. As casualties of the Harvey Weinstein meltdown in Hollywood of recent weeks, film roles like Affleck's Chuckie only confer additional credibility to an off screen questionable persona. It's too bad because I never considered him a Hollywood bad boy, but then again, how would one ever know?"
"magentaheart","9","0","1","7 November 2017"," Moving drama
","Moving, but will consider it a flick, so I only recommend it if you classify yourself as a typical audience member who does not pay attention to realism. Admittedly, I fall into this category.<br/><br/>I was most interested in the therapy aspects of the show. As an inexperienced psychology student (I'm only as old as the movie, I know close to nothing), I've been curious about the life of a clinical psychologist (or as popular culture may call it, a 'shrink'). This show probably romanticises the true nature of clinical work. Sure, it can be fulfilling, but I doubt it'll be as glamorous as portrayed by Robin Williams. Chatting with the client, instinctively knowing the way around him, followed by a success story - sounds a bit too much like a 'movie', but then again, it is... I'm still interested in clinical psychology though. I'm glad this film explicates the beauty of the field.<br/><br/>Despite this, I still enjoyed my 2 hours in front of the screen. It's cathartic for those like me who want to feel emotionally polarised for a moment. That's the nature of the drama genre - forget subtlety once in a while, draw yourself away from reality, and allow your intuition and emotions to develop."
"Chocopiegod","10","0","1","17 October 2017"," Great Will Hunting
","Written by the young minds of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in 1997, Good Will Hunting was a burst of genius that took the country by storm. With over 225 million dollars grossed in the box office, and only a 10 million dollar budget, the film was a massive financial success. Also, with a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, one of the most trusted movie review websites, the movie's story line and acting were essentially flawless. The movie follows the fictional life of Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who is a dirt poor 20 year- old unrecognized genius who does not get along with the law. His genius is noticed by a world renowned math professor, Gerald Lambeau, but Will is forced to go to therapy with therapist Sean Maguire in order to study with Mr. Lambeau. The greatness of the film sourced from the constant witty banter, the extreme nature of the relationship between Will and Sean, and the overall lesson of following one's heart.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck intelligently placed humorous comments, mainly spoken by Will, to provide comic relief to serious situations or to show the comedic side of Will Hunting. These comments, such as the ""how bout them apples"" scene, add to the overall character of Will Hunting, creating a more complete main character. The humor in the movie brightens the overall mood of the movie, allowing for a more pleasant experience while watching. The serious tones in the movie, when Will was lying down and talking to the second therapist about his childhood, were instantly uprooted when he began to sing ""Afternoon Delight"". This was a unexpected twist, but a pleasant surprise providing great comic relief and being one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. Comedy, in most cases, assists a movie, and in this case, comedy held a big part. But besides comedy, the new relationships that Will was able to make, especially the one with Sean, evolved the story line further. <br/><br/>The dynamic relationship between Will and Sean created a tension and relief in multiple parts of the movie that enhanced what would have been a simple plot. The performances of both Matt Damon and Robin Williams were so phenomenal, especially in the scene where Sean strangled Will, it was as if it was their raw emotion. This tension in their relationship exposes the truths and secrets from both characters, adding to the drama and revealing necessary backstory to connect with the characters even more. Sean is able to finally connect with Will's soft side, he is truly exposed and no longer seen as this tough and care free person. This allows for sympathy for Will's character, and an appeal to everyone's pathos. This strong relationship exposed the final side of Will's character, while adding to the greatness of the story by creating new problems and solutions. These problems only occur because Sean is trying to find out what Will wants to do with his life, and he only wishes that Will loves the life of his own choosing.<br/><br/>From the constant bickering between Professor Lambeau and Sean over Will's life to Will's own nature of sabotaging relationships because he is a afraid of things going astray, Will is unsure what to do with his life. The theme of following one's heart is a classic, that creates a deeper meaning to the story by enhancing the story line and creating a reason for Will leave and to follow the love of his life, Skylar. From Sean's story to this, they are both very appealing in pathos, allowing for more relation with the characters.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting had the perfect mix of seriousness, banter, and life lessons. From the arguments to the crying and hugging, these added new levels to the characters development, and overall made it more interesting. The banter allowed for multiple laughs, which relaxed and eased the seriousness of certain situations, and it the perfect amount to balance everything. Good Will Hunting will forever be the greatest movie of all time, and it will be a movie that will live on through many generations."

Having saw this movie in the theatre when it was first released, it is STILL my most prized go-to movie and I can't even begin to relay some of the quotes that stick with me to this day. Such a diverse role for Robyn Williams and the accents they all mastered were flawless.

","I came here and saw as expected a host of reviews which praised this film to the heavens, as well as the odd few who seemed ignorant to the masterpiece they are watching. One said, ""nothing relatable at all"", and to that person and those who think this, I would advise that if one were to go through life avoiding the chance to understand things that don't apply to them, life shan't be very fulfilling at all. In a heartbroken place I have watched this movie for the first time. The gentleness and realness of the characters in this movie, the delicate yet powerful way in which those who created this masterpiece have portrayed the lives of the young and confused, the old and experienced (and yet still not done in their own confusion), is breathtaking. Many films are created for a reason, some to scare, some to inform, to be funny. This movie was written to have a personal relationship with all who watch it, to provide a strong wisdom to those who form a relationship with it. This is one of few movies that was written to change lives, and it has certainly changed my own. The use of profanity is, unlike many films, part of the realism of the movie. The lead character Will's contrasting intelligence and personality speaks to all of us and highlights the truth about the way we are when we are young, exaggerating them enough that we can see this in ourselves. <br/><br/>This film is beautiful, and it is simply not long enough. So many messages can be removed from every single line in this movie, and to everyone this movie will speak something unique but equally powerful if one chooses to embrace it. For a picture to speak such volumes that it can alter a persons life and perception of the life they have lived is a rare and incredible and probably unintentional feat. It is not for those who do not see deeply into the film to write negative reviews, but for those who feel the strength and love and passion of this film, who choose to feel this, to praise it, and hope that another can watch it, and feel this way too."

This film shows us the human relationship of friends, lover and human. There are a lot of good phrases in this film. One of my favorite phrase is 'The question is whether or not you are perfect for each other.', which is impressive for me because it is the essence for love between men and women and friends. As we see the growth of characters, our horizon for our life widens. This film brings a lot of helpful tips for life into my value. Besides, 'Will' which is used in title and the name of the lead character includes multiple meanings, so the title is the best for this film. This film is the best ever."
"stevensc-31653","8","0","1","11 August 2017"," Surprises on every corner, and astonishingly moving!
","This film is pretty damn moving. That's the best way I can figure out how to explain this movie. ""Good Will Hunting"", directed by Gus Van Sant, is about a young janitor named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who ends up being a genius, and solves a very difficult math problem, which grabs the attention of a math professor, but Will has some pretty bad physiological issues leading him to be seen by a psychologist, played by the remarkable Robin Williams. If you have not watched this film, do not continue reading! (Unless you want this film to be spoiled for you) Trust me, you won't regret watching this. <br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" really surprised me. I was not expecting this to be such a moving film filled with some great performances. There is so much right in this film, but the first thing that really shines in my opinion is the score and soundtrack. Elliott Smith wrote many songs that are in this movie, and he happens to be my favorite musician. Miss Misery is the PERFECT theme for this film. The last scene in this movie is both extremely heart warming and unexpected. Miss Misery really turns this scene into a masterpiece. I am going to have to talk about the last scene, so if you haven't seen the movie, please go watch it, you will not regret it, trust me. The last scene shows Will gone, and his friend ends up going to his house and Will isn't there. This was super clever, because not even a few scenes back, his friend does say that one day he wishes he could just come knocking at his door, and he won't be there because he wanted to move on to bigger and better things. That's not all though. What really caught me off guard is how the film goes full circle, Robin Williams sees a note from Will, and it says exactly what Robin said in the past ""I went to go see about a girl"", and I started BALLING! The approach to making this film go full circle is amazing. It is just so unexpected, and really shows Will character ark shine, it's just all the right ways not to make a clich√© full circle ending, and Miss Misery is playing and it just elevates it EVEN MORE! I really think getting Elliott Smith to write a song for this film was amazingly clever. There was 2 scenes that I thought they should have switched the songs for, because the tone of the song and scene don't fit at all. It's when ""Angeles"" plays in a very serious and sad scene, and ""Angeles"" does not have a dark tone, it has more of a uplifting, but slightly haunting sound. They should have swapped that with the scene that plays Elliott's most famous song, ""Between The Bars"", which is a pretty damn dark song. If Gus would have just switched those songs, it would have made the scene it home WAY harder, it did take me out the scene, because I was confused by that decision. <br/><br/>Moving on, the plot is pretty simple, and it's not anything extremely unique, but the approach is, and the passing is perfect. I was not wanting to miss one scene in this movie, because it really grabbed all of my attention. I was not looking at the time, and I really was emotionally invested into Will Hunting. They did not make Will out to be the socially awkward and unattractive nerd that you would expect. Will is actually an asshole, but his personality is called for due to his past. <br/><br/>I want to talk about my favorite part of this film, which is the performances. There was no one weak actor here, but Matt Damon's and Robin Williams performances are astoundingly powerful, which really gave everyone a run for there money. The most heart crushing scene in this film is really due to the way the performances were executed, and this is the scene where Will finally reveals what happened to him that has made him so damaged, and it's just so amazingly believable on both sides. I do believe Robin Williams gave his best performance ever in this film on this scene, and likewise for Matt Damon. I was crying like a child, and I never get so emotionally involved in a film, but this movie made me start looking at film as a actual art, I mean come on. If you seen this movie, you will most likely agree with me, because every time I have watched this film with someone else, the other person ends up crying because of this emotional scene. This is THE WAY you make a moving scene, I mean it's just so, dare I say epi-- I can't do it, It would be insulting to this film. <br/><br/>I do have to say one thing I think this film is lacking, which is good cinematography. None of the scenes really show beautiful shots or unique angles, they are just pretty lack luster and average, which is a shame because I know Gus Van Sant could do some amazing shots. The reason I say this is because one of my all time favorite films, My Own Private Idaho, has some of the most amazing cinematography I have ever scene in film. I am not saying that My Own Private Idaho's cinematography is anything like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (directed and written by the one and only Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur C. Clarke), but I know Gus can pull of some amazing shots. That is basically my only complaint about this film. <br/><br/>If you want to watch a entertaining, moving and interesting drama, you should really consider giving ""Good Will Hunting"" a chance."

","This is the best movie I have seen since the Godfather. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck make a great team...not only as actors, but more impressively as co-writers. Add Robin Williams in perhaps his best role ever (too close to Good Morning Vietnam for me to make the call), and you have a wonderfully entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is convincing as the best friend to a genius, able to effectively play the joker and the friend who would ""lay down in traffic for you"". Matt Damon's portrayal of that genius realizing that life has something more to offer than batting cages and bars is equally stunning. And Robin Williams certainly leaves nothing to be desired (except maybe a beard trimmer...).<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this movie is the writing. Even if the acting were not terrific, this movie still would have made my top ten list. I was captivated from beginning to end.<br/><br/>If you've not seen it, Good Will Hunting is without doubt a ""renter"", and I think after seeing it, it's one you'll want to own to watch again and again."

","""Good Will Hunting"" is a delightful and inspiring fiction written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who are not only good actors but good writers, And especially, great storytellers. The script tells the story of Will, a young man of 20 years with a past and a troubled present, who is discovered by a renowned mathematician as a genius, even bearer of this incredible tone, the same denies and questions the feeling of life, intelligence , Future, love and society. This questioning present in the film is what shapes his moral, which is to conjecture the sense of friendship and life, to Will friendship defines life, and his best friend makes him see that he has a bright future and that is not worth it The stagnation in exchange for his friendship, thus showing himself, really, a great and faithful friend, love is put on agenda and even the choices of life itself, because sometimes what the heart says is worth more than reason, Even so, the feature gets very focused on Will's character and leaves all those messages aside, including Professor Sean's character, who is fabulous and extremely three-dimensional. The film plays a lot with the camera, we have a lot of zoom in and out, quick cuts and frames changes, and a very expensive gray photograph from the 80s - even the movie being 97 - the soundtrack is little present but director Gus Van Sant plays with visual references and uses the culture to mock the viewer, when smarter, more blind and more being manipulated and lost, is a questionable message, but the film explains it very well for the viewer more attention. Matt Damon looks great on the role, boyish face, and boy pose and he understands his character as few, even because he wrote it himself, wrote it and knew how to live it, it's not a brilliant and out-of- the-way performance, but it's a great Acting of someone who does not even seem to be acting, just living the character, Robin Williams is wonderful, he passes an air of pure peace mixed with remarkable uneasiness, his character is wonderful. Gus Van Sant is one of those full directors, he's not cool, but he dominates the various areas of a set and always does a good job. Finally, ""Indomitable Genius"" is a remarkable film, and a delightful fiction that reads like a life lesson."

","Good Will Hunting is a very dramatic movie that is focused on the life of Will Hunting and his skills in mathematics. Will is a janitor at MIT, MIT is a university near Boston, Massachusetts that is known to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Will would do math questions on a chalkboard near a professors class after school hours when nobody was there. The equations could not even be solved by the professor (Lambeau). The professor was stumbled and knew he had to find whoever was capable of solving these challenging equations. After Will gets placed into jail for having another fight, professor Lambeau bails him out under the promise that he will undergo therapy and that he will help him with the challenging questions. Lambeau takes Will to one of his old friends (Sean) for therapy. After several sessions with Sean, Will tries to get his life back in order. Sean gives Will advice on his job and on his love life (Skylar). <br/><br/>The literary aspects of the film were decent as only a few things were done well. Characters such as Will and Sean were shown to have a lot of depth, whereas Skylar and Will's best friend Chuckie, were not given to much depth to their character. Also, I found Skylar having a British accent was unnecessary as the movie already contains an abundance of Boston accents. D√©cor was used nicely in the film, for example, it was used to help show how Will is very poor. Something that I enjoyed particularly was how Will seemed to possess the element of an antagonist rather than a protagonist. Will was very arrogant, rude and obnoxious character at first, which is alike that of an antagonist. However, as the movie progresses he begins to develop the characteristics of a protagonist and the stereotypical 'good guy'. The final subject that I thought was done very nicely was the use of comedy and satire throughout the movie. I felt it kept the viewer entertained and it was used nicely to 'lighten up' gloomy situations. <br/><br/>Dramtically, the film had many things that stuck out to me. The film used lots of extreme close up and close up shots to capture the pure emotion in Will on several occasions. Something else I noticed in the film was that whenever Will was at his house or was sad the colours always reflected that and were dark and gloomy. The same thing goes for when Will was happy except the colours visible were very bright and shiny and it helped reflect his current emotions. <br/><br/>The film was also excellent cinematically. Using Boston as the setting for the movie I thought was a brilliant idea as Boston is the location of very many prestigious and recognizable universities. This really helped with the storyline. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was very entertaining. My biggest problem with the movie is the predictability it contained. After watching just fifteen minutes you could start to get a sense of how the movie was going to end off. I also would definitely watch this movie again."
"samiop","9","0","1","30 April 2017"," A great movie that stands the test of time and repeat viewings
","A film following a mathematics genius working as a janitor at M.I.T. sure doesn't sound good on paper but this film beyond defines the never judge a book by its cover statement. Matt Damon portrays a realistic south end Boston, blue collar working man; who is struggling with finding a true purpose in his life; after nearly being jailed for aggravated assault Will is approached by fields medal winner Professor Gerald Lambeau to work on highly difficult Math theory's and go through court mandated therapy in exchange for not going to Jail; as the film goes on Will still struggles with finding purpose in his life but after working with therapist Sean, Will starts finding both meaning and purpose in his life. In my opinion and from my two experiences of watching Good Will Hunting I found that this film touches viewers deeply, and resonates with you even weeks after watching it; furthermore, this film just gets better and better after repeat viewings; great and relatable characters that seem realistic further improve the movie. The films use of low key and high key lighting to show viewers the difference of living standards and locations in the movie is very effective. For example, when the movie uses high key lighting in professor Gerald Lambeau's work place to show that he works in a prominent position at a prestigious university versus the low-key lighting they use in Sean's therapy office to represent his lack of success and greatness compared to Lambeau. In addition to this the movie very effectively uses low key lighting to set the rough around the edges character of both Sean Maguire and Will hunting, this can be seen by how whenever will is in his home or with his friend's low key lighting is used to represent their rough around the edges personalities and lifestyle and the same can be said for Sean. The movie benefits very well from the deliverance of strong character lines and acting that seemed genuine and improved the movie. The use of Boston accents mixed in with a lot of slang really helped the movie establish the characters that were will and his friends and it gave a great point of comparison to professor Gerald Lambeau's more proper and gentlemen like dialect and accent; and Skylar's British dialect helped show her off as more of a preppy rich Harvard type character. I personally found the characterization used in the movie were great. The costumes used also helped in showing the distinct levels of class throughout the movie and was an excellent way to visually represent the difference between will and his friends and Gerald Lambeau and even Skylar. What makes the movie even better is the cinematic and Dramatic aspects used to bring forth a sense of realism and felling to the movie. The use of longs shots to establish settings was very effective and helped established a lot of the movies setting. The use of shot reverse shot and close-ups helped convey the emotion coming forth from the characters especially in therapy sessions between Sean and Will. And the use of hand held shot in the fight at the start of the movie really helped put the viewer in the shoes of the characters that were fighting and gave the viewer a feeling of being in the fight scene alongside the characters. The literary aspects of the film like music ended up being UN-notable but still useful in the scenes they were used. Great casting alongside purposeful and appropriate lines really gave the movie another dimension and made it even better. The use of symbolism throughout the movie gave the viewer very subtle yet effective ways of representing Wills life. The use of the square fence and square objects in Wills house showed the viewer how will was in a way trapped with his current life style; and Will using the square shaped train that is constantly on one set path (like will) to represent Will was an excellent and very subtle way to symbolize Wills life; but the best and most significant piece of symbolism in the movie in my opinion was when Will was given his own car, this represented Will leaving the set path that he was always on when using the train and now was able to do whatever he wanted. The use of a car to represent wills change and freedom to do whatever he wanted was an excellent way to tie up the movie and subtly represent the way Will has changed, due to his therapy with Sean. Despite this movie having a lot going for it still has a predictable plot along with quite a few clich√©s, although most people won't agree with me but in my opinion the predictable and clich√©d plot is not a terrible thing but ends up being one of the best aspects of the movie. The use of clich√©s like the young troubled adult refusing to get help end up elevating the movie and can give people a way to connect with the main character; and the predictable plot of Will's man vs self-conflict being resolved by the therapy with Sean and everything being all happy afterwards ends up being a nice and satisfying way to tie up the movie. The clich√© of the main character always getting the girl in the end was also a very satisfying way to end off the film as it really showed Will's change throughout the movie from being too scared to get out of his comfort zone to literally skydiving out of it by chasing his dream girl all the way to California. The conflict of man versus self and overcoming adversity was resolved nicely due to a predictable, clich√©d movie with a very satisfying ending. In conclusion, Good will hunting is a great movie worth watching more than once with very little negatives while also having a lot of positives."
"derechjacob","9","0","1","30 April 2017"," why good will hunting is something i'd watch again
","Good will hunting is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile.<br/><br/>Good will hunting is such a great movie because it is realistic and relatable. The movie is not far-fetched or unrealistic. Things such as what he did for work and what he did in his free time helped build a realistic character. The whole genius thing was a little far fetched but still more realistic than people flying. This movie was more convincing ad realistic because of how people talked. Characters such as Will and Chuckie used a lot of slang and profanity whereas the professor uses proper English and only curses when he is mad. <br/><br/>This movie had great use of symbolism as well, Will's house was surrounded by a fence and dimly lit implying that he was unhappy. The fence could also symbolize protection, Will tries to hold onto his friends instead of using his brain to its full potential. He hides in this shell until the end of the movie at which point he realizes his friends are right and he leaves his house and his shell.<br/><br/>The story itself is quite simple yet amazing. I very much enjoy how simple this movie is because it makes it just enjoyable the fifth time as it was the first time. There are no major twists and turns so the movie is still good the second and third time you watch it. The movie is predictable like how he goes to get the girl at the end but not too predictable like how he and the therapist become very close."

","I saw it when I was 1,4 saw it again yesterday (I'm 22 now) and boy....had I missed out on so much when I was 14. Many people remember this movie for the ""bar scene"" where Will Hunting knocks out the Harvard snob with his intelligence or the ""chalk board scene"" where Will answers the extremely difficult mathematical questions but in essence, the ""genius"" thing is really just a cream on top. What the movie really delved into and really focused on, was the essence of ""life"". To ME, it truly described what ""life"" was and how it really approaches people so differently yet moves them all the same. <br/><br/>I think the most brilliant thing about this movie was that the characters were all developed so well. We know the characters, we know them so much that we can write a whole skit with their personalities. The character development of each and every character was so vivid yet their depiction wasn't forced or effortful. The depiction was so subtle, yet so strong that they could say a few words but they would tell you a thousand. Every single line of the movie was gold. I don't even know where to start. So many memorable and meaningful quotes yet none of them were cheesy. I think that Stellan Skarsg√•rd's character was underrated honestly. The way he looked at Will's work reminded me of the scene from Amadeus where Salieri takes one look at Mozart's work (work that only few can discern its pure magnificence) and just gazes at awe at the same time reeking with jealousy. Yet the professor doesn't look at Will with jealousy but almost protects him like his own child, all the while determined to let this genius be known. He reminds me of something a parent would do when they realise their child is a prodigy. They wouldn't try to understand or let him/her be free but would try to do exactly what the professor did. Only a third person like Sean would be able to pry deep into the child's mind to allow the child be free. Also I think the main reason Will stuck with Sean (brilliantly played by Robin Williams) on the whole counseling thing was because Will saw a bit of himself in Sean and Sean obviously saw a bit of himself in Will. Anyways the script was magnificent the character development was just so beautiful and the movie was just so effortless yet so sublime.<br/><br/>Some people argue that the movie was ""predictable"" and that it was ""unrealistic"" which I think was a real hit in the head for me. ""Predictable""? I mean were you here to watch some sci-fi movie or did you think this would have a ""twist-ending"" and suddenly Will would be abducted by some aliens because usually movies like this that deal with ""life-situations"" are PREDICABLE obviously. Also, honestly, I don't see how this was so predictable in that Will might have become a really famous and successful person in the ending other than going to find his lover which would have made the movie really cheesy. Also given that this movie is predictable yet keeps the audience stuck to their chairs eyes glued to the screen proves that it's all that good. ""unrealistic"" hmmmm.......honestly, I have seen veryyyyyy unrealistic child prodigies in real life and Matt Damon's character is not really that unrealistic. I mean on the movie industries unrealistic scale, this movie would scale a 0 out of 10, because it's that realistic. <br/><br/>Overall, best movie ever. It kept me thinking and it grew onto me and made me really give Life a hard look in the eye."
"scn-57712","9","0","1","2 March 2017"," This movie is about a genius named Will Hunting, trying to find his way in his life.
","As of recently, many films catered towards teenagers are centered around immature humor and high school stereotypes. Unfortunately, most of these movies fail to appear relate-able or funny, very much inside the spectrum of normal to mediocre. The film Good Will Hunting, however, is somehow a more genuine approach at a coming-of-age story, with amazing acting performances and well written scripts. The movie experience is a true joy, and portrays life and maturity in a manner that is touching and heartfelt. Being a mathematical genius, the main character Will Hunting is a disenchanted youth struggling with his identity and pressures of the environment around him. This being a typical movie plot line, it is both revolutionary and surprising in the tactful way it is handled. Although the film ""Good Will Hunting"" centers around an extraordinary genius, the themes of identity, emotional healing, and love successfully imparts a universal message to the quintessential viewer. One of the wonderful aspects of ""Good Will Hunting"" is the portrayal of identity and acceptance in the transition to adulthood. Though Will has an extraordinary capacity for knowledge, his angst and confident attitude only masks the true damage and doubt that lurks. Coping with outside pressures from his mentoring professor, Professor Lambeau, (who is intent on having him enter the modern world as a researcher), Will must search within himself and find out what he actually wants to do with his life. The professor believes that Will should use his intelligence to influence the world around him, but meanwhile, Will is uncertain in the future he would like to lead. A strong-willed, widowed therapist, named Dr. Sean Maguire, portrayed fantastically by the late Robin Williams, helps Will to delve into his own feelings while also becoming a mentor and friend. Through the emotionally trying sessions, Will realizes the true pain and brokenness within himself, and in much thought, decides to follow the girl he loves. Although themes of identity and adulthood may seem common and overdone, ""Good Will Hunting"" presents its case with its poised and genuine approach. The theme of emotional healing and vulnerability is present throughout the entire movie, and handles the topic both uniquely and succinctly. One of the most memorable lines of the movie is by the therapist, who says, ""It is not your fault."" This idea of blame and almost self punishment does not only apply to Will Hunting, a formerly abused child, but also the average person in the world. Even though each situation is different, oftentimes when one is experiencing emotional turmoil, self confidence withers and vulnerability is shied away from. The seemingly impenetrable Will is reduced to tears with these simple words, the scene both shocking and touching. By making key choices in characterization and scripting, the film beautifully portrays barriers being broken down. The movie ultimately teaches that, eventually, hindrances must be faced, and though the situation may seem incredibly bleak, one is able to be good again. Lastly, of course with every coming-of-age film comes the idea of love, both in the platonic and romantic sense. Interestingly, the romance does not feel forced or clich√©, and the emphasis seems to be more on brotherly relationships than Will's growing affection for Skyler, a university student. Despite being surrounded with a band of rambunctious and loyal friends, Will still has yet to trust and depend on someone emotionally. By being an accessible, coarse, and vulnerable human being, Dr. Sean Maguire is able to pierce through Will's thick facade, and allows Will to have a mentor to guide him in the world. The movie truly showcases that oftentimes the most important relationships that are made in life are produced out of vulnerability and dependence. ""Good Will Hunting"" depicts beautifully and realistically the extent of a human friendship, and how oftentimes the strange and unwelcome guests in one's life can change it for the better. The movie, ""Good Will Hunting,"" is definitely not a clich√©, sappy, teenage film. Instead of playing on stereotypes, it takes a mature outlook on the often frequented themes of identity, emotional healing, and love, and makes it relate-able and touching to a normal audience. In taking a more subversive approach, ""Good Will Hunting,"" is both overarching and personal, which truly makes it a movie for the age, and definitely a film worth watching."

","I loved this movie through every second. It had so much to offer in Will Hunting's life, who is an emotionally isolated genius with a gift of math that surpasses even the greatest minds at MIT. <br/><br/>In what could be argued as one of Robin William's greatest roles of his life, he teaches a valuable lesson that just because there's bad in life doesn't mean that you can't open yourself up to the good things that happen in your life. Will Hunting was a prime example of this from his past of abuse and hurt, and refuses to let people in and opportunities arise in his life for the better. Sean just happened to be the right man for the job who could break down his barriers. The ending was satisfying to the tee, as all that needed to happen in Hunting's life happened. The writing by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck was impeccable. Easily a 10 out 10."

","Good Will Hunting is a coming of age story about a young man who happens to be a genius. <br/><br/>The undercurrents rolling throughout this story are vast and complex, but deep with meaning. This is a film that truly resonates with me, as I am drawn to characters that don't always represent who they are on the surface. I enjoy characters that force you to dig deeper, past their facades. Will, is one of those kinds of characters. He appears physically, and mentally strong in the beginning of the movie, but we soon learn that appearances can be deceiving. He hides behind his intellect, using it as a way to take the focus off what is lurking within him just below the surface. <br/><br/>It is only when he meets a therapist, who shares a similar past to his own that he begins to learn about himself. He is pushed without even realizing it, and begins to change, shedding the second skin he's been hiding behind. Once he does begin to take chances, and allow himself to experience things at the urging of his therapist, he truly begins to grow, and this is when we get to see the magic happen. A change elicits from within him slowly, and walls begin to come down as he realizes what he needs to do. <br/><br/>This is beautifully put together with elements of raw emotion, and words of wisdom to live by. The characters are all very unique, and many add tremendous depth to the story. We see two different glimpses into Will's character, one where he is with his friends, and a girlfriend being a typical twenty-year old, and one where he is with his therapist delving into the depths of his unique and incredible mind. We learn about him piece by piece, and of the struggles that hold him back from using his gift to it's fullest extent. It's a fascinating combination to view from the outside, and allows us to fully see the character from every angle. I loved this movie, and especially the connection that develops between Will and his therapist."

","Knowing Damon mostly from his tough guy roles like The Departed, and The Bourne Series, I was surprised by his acting in Good Will Hunting, especially because he was so young then. But taking a look at the list of movies he has done now, I have to admit that he is one hell of an actor. He has done so many different roles - which shows his capability and proves his talent. Affleck doesn't have much screen-time in this, but plays his character well enough, as did his brother Casey Affleck, and Hauser. Williams will be missed for making these tear jerking moments, as he is able to portray empathetic characters so well. <br/><br/>The film felt very genuine, mostly because it was unfiltered, and dealt with emotions from the perspectives of different people. Damon and Affleck really did quite a good job with writing the narrative, and Gus Van Sant in directing it. However, there are certain scenes where the monologues are just too long. For example, Sean had one when he and Will were sitting on a park bench after their first meeting. He just went on and on, and the close-ups too are a little unnerving. Then there was another monologue by Will while he was sitting in Sean's office, and kind of went off on a tangent to the point where I realized I had lost track of what he was saying. <br/><br/>Also, I could have done without the slow-motion fighting scenes. Whenever there was a cut, you could tell it is obviously choreographed, and that they were moving in slow-motion themselves. That along with the frequent close-ups took me out of the narrative. <br/><br/>Overall, a great watch with a complicated protagonist who has many levels to him. The cast is great, and the cinematography, for the most part, intriguing. The language may be hard to understand though, and the vulgarity is certainly off-putting, but adds to the characters. <br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","This is the type of film that makes you missing hanging out with your friends on a daily basis. The type of film that tells me that intelligence doesn't have to look, dress, or act a certain way to be respected. The character of Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a highly intelligent albeit troubled young man from Boston. He is staggeringly out of touch with the depths of both his potential and his problems. He is working as a janitor at MIT and solves and equation that Prof. Lambeau challenges his students to solve. In solving this equation and even more getting caught doing so, his genius is discovered. In order to foster this genius Prof. Lambeau leans on a former colleague of his, a psychologist. This psychologist is played Robin Williams and named Sean Maguire. Sean shows Will that struggle and love are a big part of life and he needs to embrace them both to move forward and upward. The theme of this movie can be summed up in human relationships. The many relationships that embellish boyishness and intellect collectively make this movie great. This reminds me of The Shawshank Redemption in the collective of human relationships both inside and out. Andy is troubled by his existence much like Will. The both culminate in a chrysalis type break through. The lighting of both movies is the same. Almost like they didn't do a day of filming without a cloudy sky. Human relationships are what make life worth living. In the end I was happy to see that Will ran toward his love, his existence."

","It's interesting to look back a movie that was produced almost 20 years back - pure luck browsing through Netflix! The plot is simple but soul-touching. Matt Damon was so young and handsome back then! He perfectly portrayed the role of a genius but confused young man. Although it is somehow hard to believe that there is actually someone born with that kind of gift. The personality of the character is not attractive at the beginning, but with the help from the psychologist, he eventually opened up himself and was able to live up following his heart. The ending is beautiful. Guess there is no exception before true love."

","Good Will Hunting is one of those films that make you stay in front of the screen until the credits rolls. The script, written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is simply incredible and earned the Best Original Screenplay in the Oscars of 1998. Right from the first scenes there is a break of paradigms which make us realize that Good Will Hunting is not some random film. Along the plot also has a series of social critiques and even the picture being of 1997, these critiques are still current. The director, Gus Van Sant, by choosing a movie style calmer, clean and without many camera movements made the right decision. Another positive aspect of the direction was in certain conversations, the decision to keep a closed camera in the face of some character and slowly opening the plan to show the rest of the scenery. This method was great, because it caught all the facial expressions of the character and even when he was not talking, you could see how he reacted to the other talking, but none of this would be possible if it were not for the brilliant work of the actors.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is Will hunting, an individual with a great mathematical intellect. His performance is spectacular, even the character having a great degree of complexity. He isn't just some math genius, he also has doubts, fears, just like everyone else and Damon's performance manages to convey to the public each emotion that the character is being through. The character's development is also worth mention, because each choice that Will makes increases his importance and gives a greater weight to the story.<br/><br/>Robin Williams as Sean Maguire is also amazing; his performance won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1998. The talks between him and Will are one of the high points of the film. The actors have an incredible dynamic and provide exciting scenes. He and Damon excel in the dialogues, their monologues and arguments are breathtaking, especially the ones from Damon who sometimes gives big monologues fast, that makes me wonder if all that was in the script or some lines were improvised.<br/><br/>I must mention Ben Affleck (Chuckie Sullivan), Casey Affleck (Morgan O'Mally), Cole Hauser (Billy McBride) and Stellan Skarsg√•rd (Gerald Lambeau). The first three are Will's friends, the scenes in which the four are together serve mostly as comic relief and surely, they work as such. However when the scene tends to a more dramatic and serious talk, they did not fail either. The three enable so that there is a better construction of the characters and the audience feels more comfortable and close to them. From the three, props to Ben Affleck's character, he's the closest to Will, he might be not smart as Will and shine in funny scenes, but when it's a serious talk, the scene in the demolished buildings for example is impressive, he shows his other side."

","Winner of two Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay, Good Will Hunting is written by two of the biggest stars working in Hollywood industry today and is an emotionally dense drama that manages to as inspiring as it is touching and is further uplifted by stellar performances from both Matt Damon & Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting tells the story of a young man who works as a janitor at MIT and happens to be remarkably gifted at mathematics. When his talent is discovered by the professor whose advanced problems he's been solving anonymously, he takes him under his wing and also arranges a therapy session for the troubled man that changes his life.<br/><br/>Scripted by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck, and brought to life on the film canvas by Gus Van Sant, the film follows a predictable route and is consistently paced throughout its runtime but it's the sum of the parts than the whole package that makes it an engaging ride. Few moments brim with powerful emotions while it falls flat on other occasions but it does enough to steer itself past the finish line.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are finely executed, Danny Elfman's score is truly mesmerising but Good Will Hunting excels most in the acting department. The cast comprises of Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Ben Affleck & Minnie Driver, with Damon & Williams impressing the most. Their individual performances are no doubt strong but it's their excellent chemistry with each other that turns out to be this film's highlight.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Good Will Hunting is a wonderfully crafted journey about a troubled young man who learns to confront his past & move towards a more promising future and also paints a heartfelt portrait of an unlikely friendship that develops between two unexpected individuals. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by a therapist who approaches his patients in a grounded manner and his latest client who's unwilling to open up to anyone. Worth a shot."

","This is the breakout film for Matt Damon. And for good reasons, this is a heartfelt film that delves into the mind and heart of a young math genius that mops the college floors. The story really does have humanity in it and how some people can use their power or gifts to do the right thing. Instead of just capitalizing on it while stepping over and ruining the lives of others. This film is about living without regrets and having the empathy to show compassion for others. And being able to getting past the trauma, heartache and pain to be able to move forward and find love. Robin Williams really shines in this film and puts on a moving and empathetic performance. Overall, this is a must see film that I would highly recommend. If you have heart or at least have a bit of empathy you will really be drawn into this one.<br/><br/>10/10"
"alaynabaldwin","Null","0","1","4 February 2015"," A mathematical genius who works as a janitor gets help from a psychologist to get his criminal life in check by being forced to see the truth.
","If you ever wanted to watch a movie that made you think and laugh, Good Will Hunting is a good choice. Will Hunting is played by Matt Damon and is presented as one of those guys who gets into trouble and has a smart mouth. He lives in an anything but luxurious, trashy house and works as a janitor at M.I.T. He hangs out with a guy named Chuckie, played by Ben Affleck, who seems just as rough around the edges as Will, only in track suit form. What kind of movie could this be? It is't until we find out that Will is actually a mathematical genius that we can see a good story starting to form. Professor Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, discovers what great work Will can accomplish and attempts to help Will by picking his brain and setting him up with therapy to help with his criminal and vulgar ways. Eventually, psychologist Sean Acquire, played by Robin Williams, gets called upon to push Will to his limits and to help him see the truth. The truth that Will's past was not his fault and that he needs to start letting people in his life as well as knowing what he wants in his life as well. <br/><br/>Will was a very loyal man. All his life he knew about being abandoned. Will was an orphan and foster homes were anything but a day at the carnival. Though he did push certain people away, he kept the people that mattered the most close by. Will was so loyal, that he would give up a better life for himself to just stay with his friend, Chuckie, until the end of their days. This fact infuriated Chuckie. He knew that Will deserved better and told him this at a construction site they were working at. To quote the movie, Chuckie tells Will, ""But you know what the best part of my day is? For about ten seconds, from when I pull up to the curb and when I get to your door, 'cause I think, maybe I'll get up there and I'll knock on the door and you won't be there. No goodbye. No see you later. No nothing. You just left."" (Quotes, 2015) Chuckie wants what is best for Will so much, that he would be okay with Will just leaving without a peep. <br/><br/>A great scene where Will finally embraces and deals with his internal struggles is when Sean keeps saying, over and over, ""it was not your fault."" For some reason, this finally gets to Will. It's as if the whole time, he thought he was abandoned or beaten because he did something wrong. Sean allowed him to finally release all of those emotions. It almost seems like after that moment, Will got to start over. He finally went after what he wanted in the end and did what was going to finally make him happy. <br/><br/>This movie reminded me of A Beautiful Mind. Of course, this movie also was about a man who was a mathematical genius, but he also had some struggles and truths to deal with. It wasn't until he realized that he needed to handle his mental illness and that he did, in fact, have one, that he found happiness. It took some struggle and seeing the truth eye to eye to get to where he needed to be. <br/><br/>One kind of motif I would point out in the movie is when Sean tells Will, ""Real loss is only possible when you love something more than you love yourself""(Quotes, 2015). Sean also kept asking will what he wanted in life, but Will never really answered him. Will was so used to losing things, how could he not know what real loss was? When will leaves Sean a note saying that he wasn't going to the new job that he got and was chasing after Skylar, Sean knew that Will finally understood that statement and was going after what he wanted. <br/><br/>Sometimes one has to go through a lot of struggle before they can finally figure out what they want in life. It's never fun to figure it out alone though. Will had two people in his life that supported him and wanted the best for him. It took some tough love, but he finally realized they were right and he went for what he wanted in life."

Centering on a brilliant working-class youngster who's forced to come to terms with his creative genius and true feelings, this beautifully realized tale is always engaging and often quite touching. With the right marketing, Miramax could score big with an extremely enjoyable picture whose old-fashioned virtues should play well in big cities as well as in Middle American shopping malls.<br/><br/>Fans of Van Sant's earlier, offbeat films may be disappointed by the more conventional attributes of ""Good Will Hunting,"" a ""problem"" drama dealing with the complex relationship between a rough, extraordinarily gifted kid and his equally troubled and bruised therapist. Thematically, film recalls Robert Redford's ""Ordinary People"" and especially Jodie Foster's ""Little Man Tate,"" which also revolved around a child genius of the working class.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's a testament to Van Sant's idiosyncratic talent that he endows the narrative, particularly its first chapters, with the nihilistic humor and deceptively casual style that have marked his best work, ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and the more eccentric ""My Own Private Idaho.""<br/><br/>Co-written by thesps Damon and Ben Affleck, who have known each other since childhood in Boston, protagonist is Will Hunting (Damon), a 20-year-old lad who works as a janitor at MIT and spends most of his time with his coarse friends at the neighborhood bar. Blessed with a certain genius, Will, who has never attended college, can summon obscure historical references based on his exceptional photographic memory. He can also solve difficult mathematical problems with an ease that makes MIT's richer and more educated students envious of him."
"hotredhead14-756-799475","Null","0","1","4 August 2013"," Good Will Hunting is about a genius in mathematics who works as a janitor for MIT.
","The theme of Good Will Hunting I believe is personal discovery. Good Will Hunting is about a simple janitor named Will working for MIT. However Will is not just another janitor, he is a mathematical genius that solves mathematical equations that have been written on the chalk boards in the classrooms that the other students are unable to solve. When the professor of mathematics sees these solutions done by Will he wants Will to start a job where he is able to use his gift in mathematics. Will however does not want to do this he wants to spend his life as a laborer. <br/><br/>Through the course of the movie Will also got arrested for getting in a fight and professor Lambeau (mathematics professor) gets Will released into his custody but only by Will agreeing to see a psychologist. Will ends up going through five psychologists before professor Lambeau is able to find one that Will connects with. Will also starts a relationship with a young lady named Skylar whom he meet in a bar. However when Skylar asks Will to move with her to another state Will threw a temper tantrum and breaks off the relationship, in an attempt to prevent future emotional pain. By the end of the movie after Will breaks down in his final therapy session with Sean. He then decides to go to find Skylar and make that relationship work. By working with Sean the psychologist Will was able to discover who he is and is able to move on from his past and start living the life that will make him happy. By doing this Will is then able to find his place in the world.<br/><br/>One motif that was repeated throughout the film that is related to the theme is Will going to see Sean the psychologist over and over aging. While Will is with Sean he is able to slowly discover who he is and where he fits into the world or where his place is with his friends and in his relationship with Skylar. Good will hunting also used internal conflict within Will to portray the theme of this movie. By Will having a bad childhood and allowing this to dictate his life throughout the movie it also showed us how Will's personal conflict made it hard for Will to really discover who he was or where he should be. However in the end Will was able to achieve that personal discovery of himself and move on in the world to a life that would be right for him without all the past conflict."

","Back in 1997 a small film made the name of two young actors, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who were so frustrated about their lack of opportunities wrote their own screenplay so they could star in the film, earning them a Oscar win at the same time.<br/><br/>Will Hunting (Damon) is genius with a troubled past. He is working as a janitor at M.I.T. when he solves a maths formula that is meant to challenge the best students at the university. Will is also on probation after he hit a cop. Mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) takes Will under his wing, seeing the potential in him to do whatever he wants and gets his friend Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to counsel the young man. Will also meets Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British Harvard student and starts a relationship with her. But Will is his also his own worst enemy.<br/><br/>Screenplay is really strong and you can see why Ben Affleck has become a respected director. It was a dialogue driven film that focuses on a character who is troubled, who has a tremendous give but is bitter towards people who had the wealth and luxury to go to university. He is also a man who does not know how lucky he is that people care about him and does not realise how lucky he is with his intelligence. There is a great cast who give authentic performances, Damon, Skarsgard, Williams (who won an Oscar for this role) and Driver in the main roles. There are not good guys or bad guys, they are shares of grey with all of them and the real antagonist is Will to himself. Skarsgard and Williams' characters have different approaches and views about Will but they both have his best interests at heart. Will starts off as a real jerk and I personally enjoyed it when Williams' character does get to give Will a telling off.<br/><br/>Gus Van Sant could have made visually safe film but he was able to inject a style to the film, using hand-held cameras for long shots and panning shots and edited TV footage from a famous Red Sox game whilst Sean tells Will the story about how he met his wife. Van Sant to able to make sure all the different stories involving Will's life all get a fair amount of screenplay and it is easy to follow who is who and what is happening. He is actually better a mainstream director then when he makes indie flicks.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes that do not work, particularly when Will sends his friend (Affleck) to be pretend to be him for a job interview which was played for humour but it was just felt out of place.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a compelling drama with a story worthy to tell. It is worth checking out and for a dialogue heavy film it still keeps your attention."

","Will Hunting, a janitor at MIT, has a gift for mathematics but needs help from a psychologist to find direction in his life.<br/><br/>I've seen the film back when I was about 10. I really didn't understand much of what was going on, and declared it was boring. Now today I decided to watch the film, forgetting that I was just a little kid, and was fully prepared to absorb myself into mature emotions that I never understood back then... And surprisingly, I was in for an experience, because Good Will Hunting is like a more understanding version of Shawshank Redemption. While that movie can be good in it's own ways, this one contains realism alongside the emotions, which is better already. So the acting, as you can already tell, is going to be brilliant. Robin Williams (if he's not playing in a children's film) gives the film it's best, and does it best. I love Matt Damon as well, and he basically carried the film with Williams. The supporting cast was great as well. Everything else was great too, but instead of praising the film we already know is GOOD, I want to point out my annoyances that brought down the score. The film tends to get a little corny. Now don't get me wrong, the film is well-acted, but some scenes totally trashed this idea. I'm talking about Matt Damon's rants about the law, or Ben Affleck's attempt to act cool. Although they didn't ruin the film, they annoyed me. But avoiding these annoyances, I found the movie brilliant. The story was a moving experience, and if the acting wasn't there, I think the movie would still be good. The soundtrack was also great as well, and it fit the film in a strange way... So without blabbering on about how good the film is, I'm going to rate it an 8/10...<br/><br/>Should you should it? If you can get past the slow-burn pacing and the little things that annoy you, you will be pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams is pure brilliance, and the film carries it's messages throughout brilliantly. The movie is pure brilliance. 8/10."

","While I am not quite as enamored with this film as are many, it is very good. I had never watched it somehow until 2012, although I remembered well the rise of Matt Damon because of this film. And, of course, it was written by Ben Affleck and Damon.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, Damon plays a brilliant laborer who is forced to see a therapist (ultimately Robin Williams) and study advanced mathematics with a renowned professor (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) in order to avoid serving jail time for a bloody brawl and a past record. Williams ""gets it"" and finally begins to help Damon, although the journey is not an easy one. Meanwhile, love for Damon enters the picture through college student Minnie Driver. One of the most touching scenes, in my view, is when fellow laborer and pal Affleck tells Damon that his greatest hope is that he leaves his present life and becomes a success.<br/><br/>Perhaps the very best performance of the film is that of Minnie Driver, who was nominated for best supporting Oscar. Robin Williams was excellent...and controlled here...which did garner him the best supporting actor Oscar.<br/><br/>What was most interesting for me was that I had a little difficulty getting into Damon's performance...not because it wasn't good...it was great. But because -- having not seen the movie previously -- I know how I feel about the Matt Damon we have come to know over the past decade or so, and here he plays against type. The sort of bad guy, instead of man we mostly see now as being very responsible. I'm sort of glad I waited to see it after all these years.<br/><br/>Strong film. Recommended."

","It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER."

","Gus Van Sant (mostly because we share the same hometown of Portland, Oregon) has always been one of the filmmakers I have paid attention to. I never give him undue bias, because he can definitely be hit or miss. This, however, was and always will be, his biggest hit (in terms of making an ideal film). There are hundreds of quotable lines in here that espouse more philosophy than most filmmakers pack into trilogies. The direction is steady and the acting is great, but what really sets this movie apart is the writing. The writing of Good Will Hunting is so exquisitely realistic and philosophical, that to contemplate your own life during the movie is almost a necessity. There is not a whole lot of emotional manipulation in the movie, it is basically just such a universal story, that to be unemotional would be callous.<br/><br/>Similar to the quote in the title, delivered by Robin Williams in his best role, this movie isn't perfect, but no movie is...the question is whether or not it is the perfect movie for you. It doesn't matter if I watch another ten thousand movies, this movie will always be in my top 20."

","This film is a powerful psychological drama that highlights personal growth in life and the relationships that we build around ourselves. The film is about a young genius Will Hunting played by Matt Damon who has had no formal education but is being suppressed by his past of abusive foster parents and troubled relationships. He is a janitor at MIT where his brilliance is discovered by Professor Lambeau (). Lambeau offers Will an opportunity in working with him on some of the most difficult mathematical equations instead of incarceration after Will beats a man who bullied him in elementary school. Along with working with Prof. Lambeau, Will is ordered to attend psychiatric treatment. Lambeau recruits an estranged college friend Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) in order to get through to Will emotionally and to help him realize his potential and to act upon it. Also in this film is Minnie Driver who plays as Skylar, a Harvard undergrad who is quickly falling in love with Will. Their relationship hits a rocky road when it is revealed that Will has had a troubling past and is having problems coping that she is moving to California to attend Stanford.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the human psyche and the psychological impact our past has on the relationships that we have at the moment. Wills relationship with Skylar is impacted by his past abuse with foster parents and his rough upbringing in South Boston. After a great first date with her, he doesn't call her because he feels that she is perfect at the moment, but in reality through the help of Sean, he realizes that he is sabotaging the potential relationship because he fears that he is perfect at the moment and doesn't want to ruin his ""perfect"" image with her. Throughout the film he lies about himself just because he is afraid to let her into his real world. He is afraid that she will see who he was or is and this will affect the way that she thinks about him. Another theme in this film is personal growth. Will, through connections of Professor Lambeau, has many high profile job interviews but shuns them away because he is currently satisfied with doing ""honorable"" work such as being a janitor and demolition work. Chuckie though sets him straight as the true friend that he is. Chuckie understands and realizes that his own life is South Boston, but for Will he realizes that he could conquer the world and that anything less would be a slap in the face to those that know him and what he is capable of. The movie is very powerful and has realness about it. Every day we are faced with the opportunity to grow personally and to expand our relationships with those we trust and love. Robin Williams who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this film does a brilliant job of portraying a down and out psychiatrist who has cashed out his chips for fear of losing anymore after his wife passes away with cancer. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck did a tremendous job of writing this screenplay and showcased their command for attention when on the big screen at the same time. The acting is incredible and it seems as though the players on set jelled to perfection. The story is intriguing and captivating in keeping your attention. Though there are no twist or turns, the relationships between all of the characters evolve into something beautiful. Overall the film is a joy to watch with powerful scenes about love and life relationships, and having the courage of laying it all on the line knowing that failure is an option."

","Good Will Hunting is an improbable film about a young man with an unbelievable IQ and gift for mathematics. Set in Boston, Mass, it deals will many issues that I found prevalent in that city when I was growing up 40 years ago. Everyone, rich or poor, wants to be ""smaaart"" in Boston. No one wants to be a ""fucking moron"". So, here you have everyone's secret fantasy brought to life, especially if you are a ""southie"" from the poor part of town. And that fantasy is to be able to outsmart the MIT and Harvard boys. Will Hunting does just that, and the fact that he is a janitor at esteemed MIT only serves to further illustrate the class conflicts that only his prodigious talent can penetrate and overcome. <br/><br/>Now I think that many people watching this film did not find Will's character to be believable. But Will is first of all a Boston native and so I believe that the movie is somewhat autobiographical or at least the expression of a fantasy of his. This makes the movie work for me as he is able to be himself with all of its contradictions - angry and foul mouthed but also smart and wanting the world to know it. He embodies well the Boston I remember with all of its class tensions. Intellectuals hold a place of great respect there, but they also can be resented and envied. That resentment is what fuels Will's ambition and gives the movie a sense of believability. Could this happen in real life? - sure, but only if the gift is toned down somewhat. Yeah, but thats Hollywood and you have to expect that his talent would be trumped up a bit.<br/><br/>Anyway, so I enjoyed this movie on many levels. In particular I loved Minnie Driver and believe that without her, things could have fallen apart very easily. I don't think her relationship with Will was awkward or forced. Smart girls often fall for less fortunate guys. This was one of the more satisfying relationships in a movie I have seen in quite a while. And Robin Williams puts in a strong performance although if you are from Boston you know he's no southie. He is, though, a little like Popeye the sailor man - still a force to be reckoned with. Did he and Will have to bond over fart humor though? Seems they could have worked on that a bit...<br/><br/>But Good Will hunting is overall a well written, thought provoking drama that explores a lot of issues and relationships surrounding class, career ambitions, personal triumph and tragedy. No one escapes unharmed and there are no gods in the end. The fortunate are humbled, and Will can never escape his past. This is Boston. Here we end up with a compromise of sorts where several individuals from completely different backgrounds teach each other a few things about life and grow as a result. Now if you had told me the storyline before I saw the movie, I would have been dubious that it could work. But because you had two up and coming, talented individuals writing and acting from the heart, a sensitive director, some good music and nice city shots, this is a movie I would watch again for sure. Two thumbs up."

","When people have a hidden talent, or can do something that very few other people can, they tend to show it off or even brag about it. Not the case in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a closet-genius who works as a janitor at the prestigious College MIT. He spends his days mopping hallways, and solving complicated math problems outside on the chalkboard.<br/><br/>Will spends most of his time with friends Chuckie (Affleck), Billy (Hauser), and Morgan (Casey Affleck), but once they all get in another fight on a basketball court, Professor Gerald Lambeau (Skarsg√•rd) from MIT says that he must look into seeing a therapist and agree to study mathematics at MIT. Will agrees, and after a few failed therapists an aging man named Sean (Williams) is called in to help Will overcome his struggles.<br/><br/>On the side note, Will meets a girl named Skylar (Driver) at a bar, and after a while they begin seeing each other. The problem is Will keeps pushing away at her, when really, he should be pulling closer.<br/><br/>The script, written by actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, is outstanding and certain monologues are so well written and originally acted that they rank up there with some of the dialog scenes from a Kevin Smith film. Ironically, both Affleck and Damon appeared in Dogma two years later reciting the same amazing dialog, only this time, by Kevin Smith.<br/><br/>Certain scenes where Sean is telling his life-story to Will are lengthy, but you never see the film lose your attention. Good Will Hunting is a rarity in story and in story-telling. And having two amazing youths write a script so advanced and so powerful just is the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>If there's anything the film lacks is its scenes with Affleck and Damon. Both create amazing chemistry on screen, and when brought together show off creative dialog, intense arguments, and shocking realism. The final dialog scene between the boys takes place at a construction site, where both the boys work. Chuckie tells Will that it would be an insult to the other workers here if he was still here in twenty years. Chuckie can't understand why someone like Will wouldn't want to show off his smarts, and I think I kind of sympathize with Will on that note.<br/><br/>When someone posses a talent in something they don't always want to show it. I know a number of people who are very good at a different variety of things, but none willing to show off their true potential. For me, I always want to show people what I can do, and am afraid of saying some things because I worry that they will get the wrong idea about me. I always want to show everyone my true abilities, and what makes up someone like me. But in Will's case, he doesn't want to do that for comfort purposes.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is authentic and rare. It's a film where almost everything is powerful and everything is so well done. The theme of ""self-worth"" is discussed in frequent films, but here, it is discussed stronger and with more heart than many films. It's a gem, shining stronger in places where others don't even show a glare.<br/><br/>Starring: Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Cole Hauser, and Casey Affleck.

","I know that everybody will hate me for this, but I think that Good will hunting is one of the most overrated movies ever made. Aside from its acting, there's nothing really that special about it. I liked it, but it shouldn't have been nominated for best picture.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a janitor who has a brilliant mind but a terrible attitude. The film mainly focuses on his relationship with a professor(Robin Williams) who, as he gets to know him, is the only one who truly understands him.<br/><br/>Now, I didn't dislike the movie. I thought the acting, especially from Damon, Williams, and Minnie Driver, who plays Will's girlfriend, was strong. And it held my interest the whole way through. But I really couldn't find much that special about it, excluding the performances.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are rather cheesy, I felt. And some of them are gut wrenching, but yet some are cheesy. Also, some of the characters are unnecessary. Those are Will's friends, played by Ben and Casey Affleck, and Cole Hauser. The scenes with them in it are weak compared to the rest of the film.Also, there are moments where the dialogue is smart and funny. But yet there are scenes where you can sense cheddar in the room.<br/><br/>I'm glad that Damon has won an Oscar(not Affleck, cause I get the vibe he didn't actually contribute). But I don't think that they quite deserved it. Also nominated for best original screenplay was The Full Monty(love that movie) and Boogie nights(love that one even more).<br/><br/>It sounds like I didn't like it. Not true. I never said it was a bad movie. I did enjoy it, just not as much as everybody else on planet earth. Sue me, I don't care. Boogie nights deserved its place on the Oscar ballot, or Jackie Brown.

"holste04","8","0","1","14 June 2011"," Good Will Hunting is a emotionally moving movie with a twist to it.
","In the movie ""Good Will Hunting"", the theme is based on the character Will Hunting. Matt Damon as Will Hunting is the product of children services. He has grown up as a mad and angry child who inflicts his pain onto others from foster home to foster home. As an adult, he continues to allow his anger to control his life. He surrounds himself with local friends Ben Affleck as Chuckie Sullivan, Casey Affleck as Morgan O'Mally, and Cole Hauser as Billy McBride, which gives him the feeling of family and loyalty. Within his journey he has realized that he has a gift in numbers which allows him to decipher equations from the college he is employed at, as a janitor. Gain Will get into another fight and is placed in jail. He sparks the interest from a math professor Gerald Lambeau, which is played by Stellan Skarsgard. Professor Lambeau helps him get out of jail with two stipulations. The stipulations are that Will must go to therapy and work with him doing math. Within this time, he has met a beautiful young lady, Minnie Driver as Skylar, from Harvard a pre-med student that kindles a relationship with him. After many attempt to five other therapist, Robin Williams become his therapist as Sean Maguire. Will sabotages his relationship with Skylar when he realizes it has developed into more, when she tells him she loves him. Within time, Sean breaks down the large walls that Will has built around him, and Will comes to truth about his life, that it is not his fault and that he loves Skylar.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in South Boston. The area that resembles poverty, old, run down, and dirty. The colors and lighting are dull and lifeless in the beginning, but as the movie progresses the colors and lighting become more bright and vibrant. Outside become sunnier and brighter. Inside even looks cleaner with more life. You see more reds tones within the movie as it develops. There is even a scene where Will is looking at a picture and he comments about the color and texture of a picture that Sean has painted that sits in the window. The darker scenes are when Will and Skylar are together in her dorm room. The scenes are focused more on their faces and their moods instead of what they are doing.<br/><br/>The director Gus Van Sant developed close and distant scenes to pull the audience into the movie and/or to distant them of the surroundings. He had angles from above looking down at the beginning of the movie when we seen Chuckie coming to Will's house, and then when the boys got into a fight. We had distant scenes when he pulled back for us to see the city. Plus, he used close-ups of people's faces to show us their feelings to bring us into the movie and to feel empathy for the actors/actresses. Just as in: Will fighting, you could feel the revenge he felt, Skylar telling Will she loved him as he pushed her away, and the hug that Will and Sean had when he realize he was not the fault of his anger or his life.<br/><br/>By Will going to Sean, the therapist, Will finds the cause of his own pain and anger, as the therapist finds insight and passion in himself through working with his patient, like in the movie Equus.<br/><br/>The title explains the theme of the movie, The life and times of Will Hunting. Will is a good guy; he just has not realized that he is talented and that he has isolated his feelings from the rest of the world, and that he blames himself. It took the love of a woman and the in-site of a therapist to find his inter-self. This was the first time I had seen this movie, and I truly loved it. I love a movie that can give me multiple emotions and end on a good note."

","Here's a math problem: whats (2xB) X (2xA)? Two times beautiful times two times amazing, equals, the hit motion picture, ""Good Will Hunting"". The film follows around a Harvard janitor that breaks the law most often, but has a mind like a mathematician. Weekly, he visits his match, a psychologist who helps him with his life's steps. The film just really focuses on finding his true destiny. It felt like a true-to-life feature about real people. This movie is really enjoying, and it's one of the more finest movies ever made. Written in a powerful script by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who also starred as characters in the movie, and including other members of the cast including Robin Williams and Minnie Driver, the film takes our lives to the next level, and teaches us to find our true destiny and to know who we really are as people. Matt Damon brings the performance of a lifetime as Will Hunting, but it's he and Robin Williams, as Damon's psychologist, that really stand up for this movie. Director Gus Van Sant has provided a heartwarming movie with a beautiful message, and he improves with no doubt. I really enjoyed for its fine writing, brilliant music score, and great characters. The film was an excellent choice to be known as one of the best movies of all time. ""Good Will Hunting"", in my review, ""an inspirational national treasure of a movie."""

","Working as a janitor at MIT, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) enjoys spending time with his friends Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck), Billy McBride (Cole Hauser), and Morgan O'Mally (Casey Affleck). From the slums of South Boston, Will is a diamond in the ruff, as he possesses natural intellectual capabilities far beyond what is typically achieved from any formal education. Despite his extraordinary intellect, Will is haunted by a long history of self inflicted legal problems. After unintentionally exposing his raw talent for mathematics, Will is approached by Fields Medal winning Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) who offers to resolve Will's pending legal issues in exchange for two things: his assistance in solving mind-bending mathematical equations and his agreeing to speak with a therapist. With the unwavering determination of therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), Will is forced to uncover the secrets from his haunting past, confront his current misguided motivations and pressing relationship issues with lover Skylar (Minnie Driver), and evaluate the possibilities for his future. <br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a film that really drives home the idea that people who pursue an endeavor and lack the passion needed for fulfilling their venture, inevitably fail to generate success regardless of their talent. With the rallying support of those closest to him, Will remains uninterested in the countless opportunities he is presented through professional connections of Professor Lambeau, to do little more than use his highly evolved gift of intellect. Will's commitment to friends and his constant strive for self preservation are the only passions that drive his daily existence. He views his photographic memory and ability to solve the most complex of mathematical equations a burden, and uses his ingenuity only for personal gain or getting himself out of a sticky situation. <br/><br/>Will's lack of interest in mathematics and defiant attitude towards the use of his incredible mind baffles and frustrates Professor Lambeau, as is boldly illustrated with the following remark to Will: ""Sometimes I wish I had never met you. Because then I could go to sleep at night not knowing there was someone like you out there"". Lambeau drops to his knees just prior to this line, and is looking up at Will who is standing in front of the Professor's door. The camera angle suggests that perhaps for the very first time, Lambeau feels inferior to someone who possesses no academic credentials or scholarly achievements. This is a significant and telling moment in the film since Lambeau proudly measures his success by the outstanding awards he has received over the course of his career. <br/><br/>Lambeau spends his days living and breathing his love for mathematics. He has earned a Fields Medal and is highly regarded for his work. The Professor's self proclaimed success is, in his eyes, evident from the many awards he has received for his triumphs in mathematics. Similarly, therapist Sean Maguire considers himself a success in his own right. He draws upon his relationship with his wife and pursuing a career that he truly enjoys as being the factors that have made him a success. The noteworthy achievements for each of these men stem not from their intellect or unique talent alone; the passion they have for their work has led to their success. <br/><br/>The very powerful message of what it means to be successful, and what it takes to get there, is carried from scene-to-scene throughout the entire film. Will Hunting is forced to expose his internal demons long enough to sift through years of baggage and determine what ignites his passion. Perhaps the most telling evidence that an insightful internal breakthrough is about to occur happens during the fourth therapy session with Sean, after Will had refused to speak to the therapist for the second week in a row. Very light music is the only audible sound at the beginning of the scene which then slowly fades into Sean whistling softly followed by a sudden silence. This brief moment of silence catches the attention of the audience directly before Will decides to finally speak. This dead track is strategically placed in this scene to draw attention to the fact that a change in relationship has occurred between the two characters. It also symbolizes an end to the fear of personal exploration that has prevented Will from facing his life head on, and finally puts to rest his days of cowering behind excerpts from an encyclopedia. <br/><br/>Like so many people in the world today, Will Hunting spent twenty years of his life content with simply going through the motions of day-to-day life. Regardless of his incredible talent, there was no self proclaimed success because his talents were not his passion. Simply put, the foundation necessary for achieving success was nonexistent. Passion is not difficult to come by, but one must be willing to embrace their inner most desires and perhaps set aside their talents to proclaim to the world that their journey through life has been a success. Good Will Hunting brilliantly brings to light the dark side of success and the limitations of talent."

","Good Will Hunting centers around a boy named Will Hunting (Matt Damon). On the outside, Will looks like an average teenager from an impoverished neighborhood. He wears raggedy clothes, he lives with his best friend in the slums of Boston's South End, he hangs with a band of rowdy drunkards, and he gets into trouble with the law almost ritualistically. However, there is one thing that makes Will worthy of the audience's attention, that makes him different from anyone else in the film. He's literally a genius.<br/><br/>Early on in the film, it is established that Will has a natural ability to solve complex mathematical problems and absorb and memorize information. This fact is discovered by Prof. Lambeau (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), a brilliant mathematician, when he finds that one of the unsolved problems left on his white-board had been solved on a white-board in the hall. It quickly is realized that Will has no real direction in his life. He holds no true aspirations and so he does whatever it is he feels like doing with his friends, unable to contemplate a life beyond that. Lambeau enlists the help of several separate psychologists to try and come to terms with what is blocking Will from his potential, be the boy deflects their efforts in the most humiliating and degrading of ways. However, Lambeau finds an answer in an old schoolmate-turned-psychology-professor Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).<br/><br/>Despite being an intellectual giant and a well weathered member of the South End, Will still has his vulnerabilities. One of these is that he's unable to get close with anyone. During the first-half of the film he is introduced to Skylar (Minnie Driver). They soon hit it off and start dating. However, when Skylar requests that he move with her to California, he quickly shrinks away from her, spilling reason-after-reason why he can't commit to such a thing. Eventually, his ability to commit to a full-on relationship is challenged and, on Will's terms, they end up breaking up.<br/><br/>Will is very defensive when it comes to facing his issues, and he uses his intellect in a smart-aleck fashion to help shroud them. For a while, Will is even able to keep Sean at bay, using the sensitive issue of his late-wife to fluster him and keep off of Will's problems. But this only works for so long, as Will's first attempt at this causes Sean to show the rage-filled defense that he will exhibit to uphold her honor even in her death, forcing Hunting to dance around the subject in a sparing few incidences. Despite all this, Maguire comes to gain Will's trust, to an extent, and eventually he slowly makes with Will, helping Will come to terms with his childhood abuse by the end of the film and ensuring that the events of his life weren't his fault. This release helps Will to gain some sense of direction, awakening the drive for him to finally pursue Skylar in California.<br/><br/>There are a couple of techniques employed in the film that helped to compliment the overall theme nicely. One such technique is the use of irony. The idea of a person with an natural intellect living in a slummed area such as Boston's South End sounds absolutely preposterous, yet that very prospect is what helps draw the viewer into the story, dying to know what is keeping this insanely smart kid from escaping what we all consider a nightmarish situation. Something else used in the film is a motif. A motif is a repetitive image or message (literal, symbolic etc.) that communicates a sub-theme beneath the established theme. For this theme, I think it would be the idea that intellect alone cannot aspire greatness. Drive and a want for something better in life must accompany aptitude to help make something of one's life. In addition to that, I think Will had to learn that hiding behind fear only breeds contempt and failure and unhappiness, and that the only way to conquer fear is to take that leap of faith. To take a chance."

Confidential and I know I am forgetting at least another 10 great titles. And this one. I am not including Batman and Robin and Titanic for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>What I remember, is that I never thought that a story, that may sound extremely ordinary when summarised, could be so fascinating to watch. Here were these, at the time, totally unknown guys, and a director, that had done mostly obscure projects, at least outside of the U.S., could get so much done with so very little.<br/><br/>So, if I can't remember the particulars of this movie, it is because I haven't seen it since it came out on video (not DVD), since it hadn't been introduced yet. That's why I am not giving a rating on this title.<br/><br/>When the Academy Awards show came along, you sat up and took notice. What a memorable speech from those guys. That's what I remember the most. Also, the Robin Williams speech, where the tears almost overflowed through the small screen.<br/><br/>Since then, I thought about seeing it one more time, but I think that it would have been redundant.

","This movie is very special. It features very surprising acting, a great script, and much more. Everyone in the cast does an good job, but the two that stand out are Matt Damon and Robin Williams. They are both phenomenal. Matt does a great job in his role as a punk who doesn't know how to escape his punk lifestyle (also doesn't even know if he wants to) despite being a genius. He plays being a genius very well. When he is given the big scientific words to say very quickly he does it like a real genius would. Then there is Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance. With most of the movies you have probably seen him in sucking you'll be surprised by how much of a good job he does here. Then there is the very good script to back this movie up. Ben and Matt will surprise you with how good their writing is. Also if you know Affleck for his work in stuff like ""Gigli"" trust me when I say that he can be a great writer and actor if he gets it right. Also the camera-work here is excellent.

","I kept rewinding the part in the credits where it said that the movie was written by Ben Affleck. And then I kept looking at the DVD box that said that he won an award for it as well. Never really liked him as an actor, but I guess he has some strength in writing.<br/><br/>So the film is about a young adult named Will Hunting. We see that he lives alone in a small house because his parents abandoned him, works as a janitor at MIT, and spends most of his nights with his friends at bars. But what we also learn in this movie is that Will Hunting is a genius; he has incredible strengths in the fields of not only mathematics, but in all other subjects as well. And when a professor finds out that it was Will Hunting that solved the two Algebraic graph theory problems that was supposed to be solve by a student, rather than a janitor right outside his hallway, the professor goes out to help Will. Under the professor's supervision, Will must educate himself more with Algebraic graph theory class with the professor and sees a therapist two times each week.<br/><br/>The rest is just about him trying to find himself. This movie is great and nobody can doubt it. I mean, the message that the movie brings really entertains me because sometimes we can not judge others for just how they may act everyday. It also shows how there are many individuals out there in the world that may have really high IQs, but do not know how to apply it to daily life. And that is what Will Hunting exactly is.<br/><br/>Now I have seen Robin Williams a lot in stand up comedy and he was really funny. And there were some parts in the movie that Robin Williams was funny. But I am telling you, the Juilliard studying really came out in this movie. He was persuasive with the character he was playing and had parts where he had to keep expression that many actors struggle to have. And those actors are not even comedians like Robin Williams. Matt Damon also acted well going from charismatic joking to deep depressing attitudes. However, I really did not care for Affleck or Driver's acting. It was alright. The thing was that once you saw Damon and Williams act, those two were okay.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with this movie (and if it were not for this problem, I would be giving this film somewhere in the eight range), was that there was unneeded raunchy dialogue and cursing during the back and forth discussions with Will Hunting and his little entourage. I get it that the movie takes place in South Boston, a ghetto if you may say. But still, really? Cursing to make a movie sound good? I mean, I have seen movies where cursing is used a lot more than this film, but there were scenes in this film where you really wanted them to be poignant and because one of the character said the f-word in an incorrect spot during the dialogue, it ruins it. This goes for Damon, Affleck, Williams, and Driver.<br/><br/>But this movie really tied up things great in the end. Everything that may have been confusing all comes down well in the end and you get a piece of reality once you finished this movie. I was going to give this movie a low seven as I watched it, but only when you finish this movie, I will have to give it now a high 7. Usually highly-recommended films would be eight or higher, but I say that this would be a nice movie to watch."

","One might think of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as one-hit-wonders after watching their one and only writing credit come to life in the magnificent ""Good Will Hunting."" In the wake of its success, both went on to become quite prominent in Hollywood, but only for their acting abilities, leading some to question if they really wrote it themselves or not. But surely, if someone (whether it be William Goldman or Kevin Smith) served as a ghostwriter, they wouldn't have been able to keep their mouths shut all this time. We are speaking of an Oscar winning movie here, afterall. No, the two men (especially Damon) deserve all the credit in the world and it's a shame that they haven't written another movie since, because ""Good Will Hunting"" has enough soul to eclipse any big-budget block-buster they may have done after the fact.<br/><br/>Meet Will Hunting. Will has had a tough childhood. Because of this, he chooses to stick close to his three buddies, drinking and laughing it up, cleaning up the halls of a prestigious college, ignoring his true calling. His gift, it turns out, is that he's more than just a brilliant mathematician ‚Äì he's a bonafide genius! When a professor catches him at the blackboard solving a problem no one else can, he insists on helping him. In an attempt to break through his tough shell and promote his talent, a therapist (Robin Williams) is brought in and the two find out they are more similar than they care to admit, as Will comes face to face with his brutal past in an attempt to better his future. Ben Affleck stars as his best friend Chuckie. Chuckie has perhaps one of the finest moments towards the end of the film, in a speech where he tells Will that leaving town without saying goodbye would be the best repayment he could ever give his friends. This is without a doubt one of the most moving moments of the film, and surely, one of Affleck's finest roles. As close friends, Damon and Affleck have chemistry that glows in the film; in fact, they seem like brothers from birth. Robin Williams plays the catalyst and almost-father-figure in Will's life, and turns in another fine performance in a serious role. Some improvised bits help keep things feeling natural and he brings the charm in full force, so much so that it's become a clich√© for him. <br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" is that rare kind of inspirational film that may actually inspire some. While Will's story may not be the story of Matt Damon's life, it certainly feels real and hits close to home with anyone who doesn't believe in themselves enough. Directed by Gus Van Sant, it's got little style, instead, focusing tightly on its characters, showing them in their most vulnerable moments. The script, afterall, is the star of the film. What you take away from this film will be its message and its humanity; the fact that it stars Robin Williams in a script written by two Hollywood heroes will only be an afterthought. I tried to find a flaw in it all, and alas, there is none. If anything, the story is a little too predictable -- right up to the telegraphed ending -- but that would be side-stepping the whole purpose of the story. If it takes a little clich√© and predictability to drive home such a powerful story, than so be it. The true meaning of ""Good Will Hunting"" is invincible in that respect."

","Matt Damon says, to the Oscar reviews on this movie , that ""the voters aren't always right"", and he's so correct. <br/><br/>This is so far the most soul-clutching movie I've ever seen. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>For people who never understand how emotionally bruised teens end up in various symptoms of depression, go watch this movie. WATCH CLOSELY.<br/><br/>Watch and see for yourself, how pain builds over pain, and eventually bricks up a thick, cold, ugly wall that resists sunlight to come in. How he who with such a wall established inside ""pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him"", and that however much he may in a corner of his heart longs for genuine warmth or intimacy, he's just not able to open up and let them in. And, most importantly, watch for when the WALL is being melted down, how much emotion can explode from and flood out of that person and break you, the watcher, down into wild tears, if you are able to comprehend the amount of pain behind it.<br/><br/>Matt Damon did it, with incredible accuracy. Point is when you approach such subject with emotionally bruised characters,even the slightest hint of inauthenticity could easily give you away----for the people who did experience it know exactly how it is. And any mishandling of such emotion, too far-pushed or too slow, will inevitably cause the audiences to resent----for they felt like being misexplored at their most painful spot.<br/><br/>But he did so well. He causes you to resonate with your own bruises, face up to your own pain. No patronizing, no preaching, no trivializing. Every scar was revealed in an authentic, respectful, humane and serious kind of way that you end up in gratitude that the creator of this film truly cares----it's not just about a movie, it's about psychological wounds many share in common. It's about human, and humanity.<br/><br/>I wonder how Matt Damon did it so well. I'd rather assume that he did, for himself once had a similar experience in life, than that he simply achieved this by outstanding acting skills. The latter would be nearly impossible to do, having known for myself what this type of pain was really like.<br/><br/>Affleck and Damon are an unbelievable team, both in acting and writing this movie. Robin Williams sure as hell deserves the Oscar he got for his role here, and the rest of the cast all did a great job. The movie has a very smooth and well-structured storyline. No waste scenes, one step tightly after another, unfolding the character's emotion progresses. When you finally witness Williams's role gets to the soul of Damon's role with a number of ""It's not your fault"", your icy wall if you have one too, shattered with it.<br/><br/>Most soulful movie I've ever seen. For me it's mostly because I suffered similar bruises myself, but note this, you do not need such thing to appreciate it. All you need to be, is a true human being.<br/><br/>Go see Good Will Hunting."
"dennis_87","10","0","1","4 February 2009"," What do you want to do...
","Before I go on with my ranting, I want to first mention that I write this message with the intention of making known my belief of what this movie is about and what sort of connection it's attempting to make. One who's never seen this movie should feel that this message tells you what the central theme of this movie is, whereas for the ones who've seen it, this should offer nothing more than another point of view.<br/><br/>I feel the central idea of this movie is to put forward a person (Will) with an infinite (""bound by nothing"") potential and at the same time an inner demon that held him back from the world. And what Sean (Robin Williams) offered him is courage and he taught Will that part of living life is to have this courage to face his inner demons and choose his own path without fear. <br/><br/>***What do you want to do?***<br/><br/>One of the major theme in this movie is this very question. By putting will forward and showing that with all of his genius, he's lost when facing with this simple question. What do we want to do? The point of this question is not to get an answer as simple as ""I want to be a lawyer or a doctor"". I feel the point of this question is the question itself. It asks you to give an answer that ,despite all the genius and all the power of reason and logic, you can not find a definitive answer to. It asks you to understand yourself, to search for something that you can never truly know you've found. It involves devotion,love,risk, loss and disappointment, something Will will never dare to face. When Sean asked Will this question, he wasn't expecting will to answer it with a definitive answer, but Will is thinking of it as a question and he can come up with all the reasonable answers in the world, they would still be wrong, because for will, he's too scared to face his own inner demon and too confused to know what to do with himself. What Sean offered will is the reflection of his own life. He tells will despite all the pain and loss, it's OK, because that doesn't diminish even slightly the greatness of love and life. He showed will that true loss is only when you love something more than you love yourself, and at the same time that's where true happiness emerges. It is through all the conversations and sharing Will slowly realizes that he's not alone, he has the chance to be happy if he has the courage to face down his own demon and to find his own joy (as he chased after his girlfriend at the end of the movie). What We all need is to do is to find a path and have the the courage to follow through. Most of the times we don't know if what we've chosen is the correct path, but as long as we tried, Joy and love will always be there to carpet the road of pain and loss. That is what life is all about.<br/><br/>***what is failure, what is success*** In this movie, there is an interesting contrast between the field metal winner and the supposedly lowly psychologist who lives and works in a small apartment. This movie offered a chance for one to think about what is true success? Is it how much money you make? The working environment? Pension? bonus? or is it as the producer of this movie believed, that there's no true success or failure, it's about what we want and to live is to feel. For those who do not know, Field Metal is a huge deal, it's probably more amazing than the Noble price for math people. This is a really interesting question, I just want to throw it out there. to write what I think would make me run out of space.<br/><br/>***one interesting scene*** there is a picture of a man rolling a boat inside a storm, that is my favorite scene in the entire history of movies. The use of one painting and a few words from Will entirely described the sadness of the sullen psychologist and it also offers a very unique and interesting portrait of what it means to feel completely lost and helpless. If you've felt like that before in any point in your life, You would appreciate this scene, at least that's my point of view.<br/><br/>Overall, This is a story of trust, courage and love. It showed the most fundamental question that someone in my age (early 20s or even late teens) should always bear in mind. and You should never miss a movie as intelligently crafted as the Good Will Hunting."

","I'm not sure why I like ""Good Will Hunting"" so much. The plot is such a simple story of Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a young man with intelligence way beyond his years, yet all he is choosing to do with his life is cleaning the floors at his job and hanging out with his friends. After getting in trouble with the law, college professor Sean Maquire (Robin Williams, in his Oscar-winning role) is the only person willing to counsel him and turn his life around. Maybe I enjoy this film because I relate so well to it, as I am a college student unsure of what to do with my life. The film has rightly been described as a ""slow-burner,"" and I would agree. It was during my second viewing that the film's greatness suddenly hit me, and I really began to like it. It entertains but also brings tears to my eyes. It has the same inspirational value as Robin Williams' earlier film ""Dead Poets Society,"" for which he also should have won an Academy Award. Although I prefer this film, since it focuses more on inspiring a single person rather than an entire group, both movies are excellent. Maybe it's not an entirely perfect film, but watch this one (more than once if necessary) and be prepared to be moved.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"jdkraus","9","0","1","29 March 2008"," A great film!
","Good Will Hunting is a great movie. Of all the films I have seen Matt Damon in, this is the best one. His character isn't an action hero like in the Bourne Trilogy, nor is a comical thief in the Ocean's series. He plays a youth in south Boston, driven by his fears of abandonment and a lack of trust in people. However, his unique math abilities are discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard) who gives him an opportunity to change his original lifestyle from a street punk to someone of value and good qualities.<br/><br/>He later sees a therapist (Robin Williams) and finds a girlfriend (Minnie Driver), who become the two benefactors that ultimately makes him into something more than he ever thought. Besides Matt Damon's Oscar nominated performance, I found Robin Williams to be fascinating. Rob won an Oscar for his role and it is rightfully deserved. He made me laugh and at times put me close to tears from the talks he has with Damon about life and change.<br/><br/>The additional performances by Minnie driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben and Casey Affleck are all wonderfully. The script by Ben and Matt is both entertaining and genius. The score by Danny Elfman was also a nice addition to film. But I give this move a 9 out of 10 because there was so much unneeded foul language. I'm used to hearing bad words, particularly in the likes of an Oliver Stone and a Martin Scorsese film, but not for something along the likes of Good Will Hunting. I guess Matt and Ben felt they needed f-bombs and other sexual dialog to make the film more real. The film would still be real without them."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","15 March 2008"," One of the most deeply and essentially human films ever
","Perhaps the only thing that's beyond normal in ""Good Will Hunting"" is the fact that Will Hunting is a mathematical genius. The rest is about as real as a film can get while still being interesting. To be two hours about a young man and his issues and to be so good says a lot about the acting and the writing of this film: that it's very, very good.<br/><br/>""Hunting"" stars Matt Damon as the title role, the enigma that is Will Hunting. Damon is so good at capturing the broad spectrum of his character's emotions. Hunting is written to be a psychological head case who thinks he's figured out what life's about and what people are about and Damon really shows you that. It's a role that would seemingly be played by Leonardo Di Caprio, but we all know what he was busy doing in 1997.<br/><br/>Hunting is a janitor at MIT and when he starts solving some of the most difficult of math equations, he gets discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard). Because Hunting is an orphan and spends most of his time around South Boston getting into trouble with his friends, the plot gets moving when the professor agrees to get Hunting out of jail time with the exceptions that he spend time on math with him and that he go to therapy. After therapy with several top shrinks fails, Hunting is taken to Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) and the two form a unique relationship. The film is in general about the psychological and social journey of Hunting as he begins to understand what life's really all about.<br/><br/>Just as good as Damon though are Skarsgard and of course Robin Williams, who is in a role that seems perfect for him, or at least he makes it his own very much so in this film. His character is so honest, but also very poignant and funny.<br/><br/>It's a simple concept really. You tell the story of a genius who was orphaned and abused as a child and you have a story of untapped potential and of letting go of the past to embrace the future. Damon and Affleck, who are responsible for the film's intelligent screenplay simply tell this in a really complex way, showing it through the relationship between Will and Sean, Sean and Professor Lambeau, and even Will and his best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck). There's a very wide spectrum and experience there. Sometimes the dialogue does seem a bit too elitist and literary, but most of the time it's natural and just meaningful. Gus Van Sant adds some touches of his own, but this is mostly about the story and the characters, so he succeeds at his job of letting it be about them.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" might now blow you out of the water, but it's touching because it's so human and because the characters could be any of us. Will is the extreme (lonely poor orphan math genius), but we all identify with extremes better in some way, and that's what makes this film successful."

There were a lot of little nuances, like the Dunken Donuts coffee, and the interaction between the friends that made this film great. Ben Afflec and Matt Damon had great chemistry; maybe it is because they were such close friends in real life. All the acting was really great. The accents were priceless. I'm glad that Robin Williams was finally able to get an Oscar because he is really great actor and he totally deserved it. This film made me wish I was better at math, seems very lucrative.

"bull-frog","7","0","1","5 April 2007"," Fairly predictable ending with over the top swearing
","Will Hunting is a troubled kid who happens to be a super-genius. The storyline is simple and easy to follow. The acting and character building of Will is excellent. The film looks very natural and I see no use of exaggerated special effects, which is unusual in today's day and age. The writers and directors really put an effort in attempting to tell a story. Unfortunately there are a couple things that bothered me.<br/><br/>First problem I have is with the language. I think this movie would still have gotten their message across if they toned down their use of the F-word. I don't have a problem with it being used sparingly and I can understand it fits a character like Will, but when you have a therapist/professor constantly using it, that's really going overboard. Unfortunately, that's the one thing I remember the most about GWH.<br/><br/>Second, the movie is boring and fairly predictable. They do develop characters fairly well, but the movie moves along very slowly. And worse, you could see the ending from a mile away. There is little suspense throughout. How Will goes from a stubborn, hopeless kid to one that's willing to change his life around is sort of lame. He stumbles upon two of his mentors bickering, shows remorse, gets a tongue lashing from one of his mentors (Maguire), gives in, and all of a sudden he's a changed man. <br/><br/>My rating: 6.5 of 10"

","THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/>i was surprised when i knew that it was Matt Damon and Ben Afflick who wrote this deep movie especially when discovering that Matt was just 27 and Ben 25 at that time. how were they able to dissect the human psyche in this brilliant, subtle way at such an age? Will Hunting is a psychologically disturbed guy who has been severely abused during his childhood and thus decides to take a defensive, aggressive approach towards every body outside the small circle of his closest friends. Will is a real genius in science yet his sense of loneliness, fear and emotional deprivation doesn't allow him to make use of this heavenly gift. he repels people out fear of going through more sufferings, of discovering that they are not up to his expectations, of being stabbed or deserted by somebody he becomes attached to. Will translates his anger into a series of hostile acts which reflect an unconscious desire of revenge against those who tortured him as a kid.<br/><br/>yet things seem to take a different course when professor Gerald Lambeau discovers Will's brilliance and decides to put him on the road of fame and success, an attempt the boy strongly resists because he doesn't have the will, stability, and strength that help him choose the route he wants to follow.<br/><br/>through psychological therapy sessions which Gerald arranges for Will, (Sean) the shrink succeeds in uncovering Will's old, untreated wounds giving him the courage to derive his judgments out of real experience noting that ""nobody is perfect"". Sean gained Will's confidence through open-heart talks away from the traditional patient-doctor relation. i felt some similarity between both characters, i don't know why. may be because both of them suffered in childhood or because Sean was satisfied with doing what he wanted to do, regardless of what others think of him, and tries to help Will reach the same satisfaction. may be Sean is not as famous as Gerald but he is in peace with himself.<br/><br/>i liked the part when Will asks Sean ""didn't u think of remarrying ?"" ""My wife is dead,"" Sean keeps repeating- it is an emphasis of that idea of a ""soulmate"".<br/><br/>i liked Ben Afflick's part as Will's true friend. he urges him to go and pursue his career though they may never meet again. Afflick feels that Will he is a different guy,he has got a talent that should not be wasted in trivialities. in brief,he is a true friend.<br/><br/>the acting in this movie was superb Damon, Williams were the most shining stars yet the whole cast was great. two scenes i liked most: firstly,when Sean takes Will to sit by a lake and starts talking to him about the importance of going through experience. secondly. the climax scene when Will bursts into tears in Seans arms, it a moment of catharsis and relief.<br/><br/>the movie is a search for one's true self and a quest for man's ability to overcome his past sufferings and look forward for a new tomorrow."
"jbartelone","7","0","4","14 March 2007"," Overuse of F-Word Kills A Good Film
","There are some excellent moments in Good Will Hunting. Matt Damon, the genius, conceited, janitor working nights at MIT, doing the bars, and eying the women with his (real life) buddy and best friend Ben Affleck along with the Psychiatrist, Robin Williams, who tries to keep Damon out of jail and on the straight and narrow path.<br/><br/>It's a very good coming of age character study, mixed in with some powerful scenic changes and moods. Director Gus Van Sant creates a genuine feeling for the characters and their situations so that you can (almost) feel empathy for Will Hunting and his troubled past. BUT...<br/><br/>The film's tender moments are ruined to the point of destruction with the F-bomb coming out of Damon's mouth at every other breath. This approach seems to be more for shock value, and it is overdone so much that friends of mine who had seen this movie thought it was overkill as well. A couple of relatives walked out of the theater because the language became so bad it was like, ""OK, when is it going to stop?"" The movie becomes a chore, a task to sit through when it shouldn't be because of the non-stop profanity. Many will think Damon doesn't need therapeutic guidance, but his mouth washed out with soap instead.<br/><br/>This is a movie where I actually like the censored TV print better! Without the F-bombs, the story is so much better and delivers a richer meaning than leaving them in.<br/><br/>The bad language really hurts what could have been a GREAT movie."

","I first watched this film on DVD after recognizing the title at the local video store. I was pleasantly moved. it is now one of my favorite movies. as i am sure many others were, i was shocked and initially a little doubtful upon hearing that the screenplay was written by Damon and Affleck, and couldn't help thinking that perhaps the latter's input was the occasional pizza run and neck massage for Matt's writers block. i am not a Ben affleck fan and use his name in the credits as a sign to steer clear but he doesn't manage to cripple the subtle magnificence of this picture. will hunting is a gem of a character, complex and heavily guarded, possessing a unique and superior gift and masking it with an arrogant mistrust in anyone but his four drinking buddies. robin Williams gives what i rate as his best cinematic performance as the only outsider to break through will's defenses and have any influence on his actions, using his own experience and surrendering his own covers to eventually gain wills trust and, in a poignant scene, releases will's true emotions and gives him the confidence to let himself do something with his gift. The effect that will has on every person he meets is relentlessly entertaining, whether it be the Harvard business student, the shrinks (and hypnotist), the other mathematicians, the job interviewers or Skylar. His un-rivaled knowledge and accompanying wit shape some hilarious and impressive scenes. when reading through the comments made about GWH i cant help but laugh while feeling sorry for those people giving one star and advising people to ""avoid the hype"". there are even a few people complaining about the language used. uuuuum, do you expect a person of will's background and lifestyle to speak in perfect English, avoiding profanities as to please those around him? the essence of the film is the character of will and his struggle to transcend the injustices of his upbringing. have the people making these comments any knowledge of movie history or prestige? the greatest movies made throughout history are those that step outside the boundaries and portray REALITY or a dramatized or sensationalized version of it. thats the beauty of cinema, we see the poignant moments of life portrayed in new and thought provoking ways. i advise anyone complaining over the language used to watch the likes of ""a clockwork orange""; ""goodfellas"" ;or ""shindlers list"". these are great movies, high up on IMDb's top 250. i am not saying that GWH breaks any new ground in terms of explicit viewing because it doesn't; the language fits appropriately and any attempt to dull it down would ruin the essence of this masterpiece. I wont compare this movie to the heavyweights of cinematic history, because it doesn't need to be, GWH simply is a picture that must be seen, and WILL always be treasured by movie fans, it moves you in a way not many things can in the times we live in. The hype is just. ""ordinary people"" gave a similar message, but Good Will Hunting delivers it in astounding and unforgettable fashion. this movie is what superlatives were invented for."

"rchrdshelt","8","0","2","7 September 2006"," Despite one or two flaws, worth watching for some excellent performances and a fairly original story
","Having been meaning to see this film for a long time I finally managed to last week and was largely impressed.<br/><br/>The film is very entertaining and has many memorable scenes of great acting and writing that are some of the best out there. I don't want to get into the plot other than say it is fairly plausible and original, borrowing from other genres but never feeling like its something we've seen before.<br/><br/>First of all, I'll talk about the films most impressive aspects. The best thing about this film by far is Robin Williams. I haven't seen too much of his dramatic work but his performance here is certainly the best I've seen him give and was definitely deserving of his Oscar. He wonderfully delivers some of the best emotional scenes in the film and is brilliant in virtually every scene he's in. Similarly, Minnie Driver is impressive as Will's girlfriend and brings a lot of welcome humour and credibility to her role and, along with Williams, keeps the film mature and not too immature- something I'll talk about soon. Similarly, Stellan Skarsgard is solid as a mathematician both jealous and fascinated by Will's talents.<br/><br/>The other good thing about the film is many scenes in the film. Many of the scenes between Will and Sean are well written and their is a fascinating and compelling speech made by Damon towards the end of the film on his refusal to work for the government.<br/><br/>The always excellent Danny Elfman delivers a very good score also.<br/><br/>Unfortunately these good aspects are held back by the completely unnecessary amount of gratuitous swearing throughout and average performances of Damon and Ben Affleck. If profanity is done tastefully and humorously (as shown by Quentin Tarantino) or is said out of desperation then that can help the material work. Here it doesn't. I didn't keep count but this film has an unbelievable amount of bad language that added nothing to the story and just felt like it was being used to fill dead spots in a conversation.<br/><br/>Another problem is the character of Will. He is far too cocky, arrogant and foul-mouthed to evoke sympathy and I believe his character should have been altered to make him a little more likable. Similarly Damon (despite one or two decent emotional scenes) is not very impressive either. Then again, thats probably his characters fault. The most annoying aspect of the film is Ben Affleck's character who I actually got so annoyed with I felt as though his screen time should have been shortened by half. Like Damon's, his character is the complete opposite to the one he plays in Armageddon and is largely unlikable and unappealing given he acts so stupidly throughout. Affleck (again, despite one good scene towards the end) therefore is unable to bring likability to his role either.<br/><br/>However, thanks to an original and intriguing story, some excellent performances by Williams, Driver and Skarsgard, the film is well worth watching.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Other reviewers, professional and public alike, have praised this movie to the skies for its superb writing, fine acting, and smooth direction. This was, of course, the career-maker for two of Hollywood's biggest stars, and an inspiration to young would-be filmmakers.<br/><br/>One element that has not, perhaps, received as much attention is the degree to which this movie deconstructs for the audience one of its primary tropes: what it means to be educated. As an educator, I find the point a crucial one, and one which elevates this movie from the merely ""very good"" to the level of ""important.""<br/><br/>There is certainly a simple surface reading, in several scenes in which the audience is explicitly told that it is individual talent, ambition, and personal character which make for genius, not just a collection of degrees after your name from a prestigious university. The best of these is the scene early on at the bar, as Matt Damon's ""Will Hunting"" character dresses down one preppie pseudo-intellectual after another, revealing that the 'education' they have received could have been bettered at any local library. It's funny, and it's true: education doesn't happen when you get an ""A"" in a class, it happens when you internalize a bit of knowledge so thoroughly that you can integrate it, on the fly, with other material, as Hunting proceeds to do in a blistering (and hilarious) verbal assault.<br/><br/>But just as important is the subtext of Damon's character's story-arc as he proceeds from working-Joe to star-pupil. Rather than being seduced by the prospect of grants, lab-space, or prestigious employment which his degree could net him, Hunting chooses to pursue his principles (and the love of his life). It could be a ham-handed, overly dramatic feel-good moment, but it's not because Hunting doesn't arrive at this decision by giving up his brains and following his heart. Quite the opposite. His decision is almost cold-bloodedly rational. It is arrived at after much debate, external and internal, and a number of quotes, statistics, anecdotes and analogies are forwarded from both sides of the debate: it's an instance of education in action, not as a bloodless, disconnected ivory-tower theory, but as a living model for our lives. Would that more students would approach their educations in that fashion."

This movie really defines his ability as an actor.<br/><br/>This movie requires one to think pretty quickly, as you can miss a lot of the detail as you head into the movie. This kid, who plays as a janitor has the mind of a math genius, however, he has a troublesome life. Robin's character eventually shows him the path that he should follow to make his life better, and put his ""gift"" to use.<br/><br/>I rate this very highly. It's an excellent movie. Not entirely family-friendly, but the adults and teenagers both might have something to appreciate."
"scottsue98","10","0","2","9 June 2006"," Try to understand this ... please?
","1- It's a movie, you don't believe the plot lines? Welcome to Hollywood. For example: Do you think 8 guys would cross Europe & find Private Ryan? Of course not, but you've got to buy the basic premise folks. ANYTHING can and does happen IRL, why not this? (who cares if it is a Math Genius or a Stud athlete - hell both are rare, but how many 'sports stud' movie characters do we automatically accept?) <br/><br/>2- The REAL story within the story is not about the boy-girl relationship, or the buddy relationships. It is a man who finally realizes that another man knows what he's been through, GETS IT, and at the same time, has shown him that whining about it is not the solution. Robin William's character stands up to Damon's character in a way that nobody else ever has - and it works! Especially his ""I'll end you..."" line. (I was sitting in my seat thinking, ""Robin Williams might kill me"") I'm sure he'd never been made to believe that somebody would represent anything to him that strongly. THIS is the relationship in the movie that matters. Whether he makes it w/the girl or his buddies die by age 30 really is secondary.<br/><br/>3- Real life, sadly, involves less than perfect people who use less than perfect language. Sad, but true. Yeah, it was a bit much, but that's what Hollywood does. More people are jerks than are NOT jerks. They brought you down, and they brought Damon's character down, just like real life. So the point was made.<br/><br/>Bottom line? Enjoy it for what it is. A well told coming-of-age 'hope for the best in an imperfect world where you have both incredible strengths and weaknesses' kind of story. It is not a flawless story (name ONE?), but it made you care about some of the folks in it, which is more than most movies do. There ya go!"

","Hi, i am Sam Radseresht. When i first saw this movie, i thought it was the film with the most bad language in the universe. But then, i looked at it again and again. And in the end, it practically became an obsession. I admired Robin's character Sean so much that i even wanted to be a therapist. I put books all over my room, read them, and studied hard in school. The film was truly a strong inspiration to my life, and i do want to take the opportunity to thank Robin Williams, for making his character so believable and real. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck for writing their wonderful screenplay that consisted of so many beautiful words of knowledge. Gus van Sant for making it possible and my mum for buying it a our local Virgin. So, if you wan't a movie of speech, excitement and emotion, Godd Will Hunting is the best so far. Even if you may not be a fan of Matt, Ben, Robin or any other cast members, please do watch it for they certainly deserve a big applaud. <br/><br/>It is one of those movies that will catch and touch your heart. A sea of Emotion. And in the end, there is a message for us all, but that is for you to find out. It focuses on Will Hunting (Damon) and how his troublesome past has left him isolated and off his path. When he is mopping the floors of MIT tech (boston), a teacher recognizes his astonishing talent and works with his math studies. Problem is, Will does not want that, and the Maths teacher cant understand his problem. So, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) teaches Will to not be afraid, and realize to not waste his talent but use it. Together, they discover their resolutions and reveal their secrets. <br/><br/>But what strikes me about this movie is everything. If i was to find one word to describe watching this movie,,,..... Impossible. It just takes quite a lot to describe it. When i watched it, there was one scene that was so emotional, i could feel goosebumps on my skin and water in my eyes. A heartening experience, powerful and remarkable acting. SEE IT NOW. IT IS MORE THAN A FILM!!!!!!"

","There was an individual who talked about the unbelievability of this Movie, how Will was a math prodigy with only little formal education. He also said it isn't logical because he himself was a math God, and he would know. Well, to you, get over yourself, the movie was great! Go bowling With Professor Lambeau and have a nice conversation about ""exciting math theory."" I think it is definitely believable, hence the word PRODIGY. Some people don't like the fact that they aren't the smartest human being in the world. This upsets them, so they must claim ""fallacy"" to make themselves feel better. Yeah, Hollywood exaggerates, get used to it. Anyway, this movie is definitely a must see for anyone that can enjoy a movie without getting offended that there actually might be a genius in the world, and who can enjoy a beautifully made Film!"

","""Good Will Hunting"" is a movie about a young man from the south side of Boston, the rough and tumble neighborhood of Southee, who is having tremendous difficulty coping in the adult world. He is reaching his twenty-first birthday and the age when he is no longer a ward of the state. The question is can he conquer his demons, grow into adulthood and be a contributing member of society.<br/><br/>Will Hunting (Matt Damon), an orphan approaching adulthood, has moved in and out of several foster homes as a child, and has had several run-ins with the law. But he is also a genius, who can solve math problems on the level of Euclid and Pythagorous. The only question is: In which direction will he turn? Will he stay with his street-wise gang of friends? Or will he grow up, start looking for a career job, and start taking some responsibility for his own predicament? Will Hunting is cocky, belligerent, and downright nasty at times until he finally meets his match with Dr. Sean McGuire, (Robin Williams). McGuire talks Will's language, sports, sex, and even profanity to try to get inside the boy's head, to see what's really bothering him.<br/><br/>Comic relief plays a large part in the movie. In one scene, Will accuses his first therapist of being gay and making a pass at him, sexually. Also at a local bar, Will is trying to protect a friend from getting humiliated, and gets into an argument about colonial imperialism with a smart aleck. This bar scene is also very enlightening.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" is the movie that made Matt Damon a star. Matt Damon, along with good friend Ben Affleck won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Robin Williams won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor."
"RedHawk180","10","0","2","20 February 2006"," Very Good Will Hunting
","This movie is wonderful just because it is all genuine human emotion. How it is natural for anyone, no matter how bright they are, to not want to experience life because of their own field of experience. How we can cripple ourselves with our own sadness. We see Will Hunting who has this amazing gift for mathematics, yet he does not use it. I think it is very poignant to show how on the surface, it appears that will does not use his gifts, or try to accomplish anything outside of being a janitor because he is stubborn. When the movie progresses, we see that he is not stubborn, just in a great deal of pain. The movie as a whole is great because of the chemistry between Damon and Williams. Being a psychologist, Sean Maguire(Williams)is supposed to unravel the enigma that is Will Hunting(Damon). To find out why someone with such exceptional abilities is constantly in jail. Sean attempts to guide Will. He does not show much companionship towards Will early on. Sean would not allow Will to toy with him as he toyed with numerous other psychologists. What I love about this movie the most is the fact that Sean was only able to reach Will and help him, is because Will first reached him, and helped him. Sean was still grieving over the death of his wife. Grief that was preventing Sean teaching at MIT instead of teaching at a community college. Will encouraged him to move on. Will was grieving over the painful experiences of his childhood. Sean encouraged him by making him realize ""It's not your fault."" One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Any film and any actor that can truly portray vulnerability, pain, and the will to do what is best for you, is a great film in my book."
"valadas","8","0","2","10 February 2006"," Incredible but authentic
","This is the incredible story of Will a working class young boy who besides working as a janitor first and in the building construction afterwards, is also a genius in mathematics and several other scientific fields which he learned all by himself. But simultaneously he is a petty delinquent for which he has already got a criminal record mainly for assaulting other people in street fights with the likes of him. Despite being a real genius he is also an insecure boy fearing life and love due to the very unhappy childhood he had, which makes it very hard that he can take advantage of his intellectual ability. It also leads him to be rude to those who want to help him since he doesn't trust anybody. All through the movie we see the work of the two men who try to bring him to life and to take conscience of his own value: a maths professor and above all a psychiatrist who had his own problems in life too. This is shown in a brilliant way in terms of players' performances, images and dialogues with deep analysis of feelings and behaviours. All the players are excellent. A special reference to Minnie Driver as the boy's girlfriend with her spiritual and intelligent look and her moving reactions to some of Will's difficult to understand attitudes. This story is genuine indeed in terms of sentiments and actions and very well put on film. One of the best movies of its year."
"paul-woodward","8","0","2","19 December 2005"," Under-rated music
","This is an excellent film for reasons mentioned elsewhere, but what I would like to add is a comment about the wonderful music that accompanies the film. The songs are written by Elliott Smith, who was truly an under-rated song-writer. I would urge everyone who enjoyed this film to go out and buy his album Either/Or, you will not regret it. His softly sung love songs add perfectly to the overall feel of the film. Elliott Smith subsequently played a song from the film at the Oscars ceremony, a somewhat bizarre scenario as he was a quiet and reserved man, somewhat out of place in that environment. Tragically he died in 2003, but his music lives on as an inspiration."
"b-doyle","9","0","2","13 December 2005"," Robin Williams' best performance?
","One of my all time favourite films, 'Good Will Hunting' portrays the trials and tribulations of a 20-something genius fighting to reconcile his talent and his lifestyle. Matt Damon is superb as the fresh-faced, insecure Will Hunting, and displays a striking sense of vulnerability beneath a rough, uncompromising exterior, particularly in the psychiatry scenes...which brings me to Robin Williams. Whilst I have occasionally thought that Williams can tend towards the cloyingly sentimental, his performance here as Will's psychiatrist is truly towering, which was acknowledged by a 'best supporting' Oscar. Peter Sasgaard (think that's how you spell it!) is also worth a mention, with an excellent performance an unlikable, but ultimately well-intentioned professor. Minnie Driver also stars in a nicely portrayed, if somewhat limited role."

"matthewbalnaves61","10","0","2","7 December 2005"," Simply Genius Film
","Good Will Hunting is a beautiful and thoughtful film, which comprises the main aspects of brilliant film making. Director Gus Van Sant has taken the script and plot created by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and created a world in which the film seems real. The film is strikingly naturalistic, which blends well with the fact that Will Hunting is such a genius. The relationships that Will Hunting finds himself in throughout the film are portrayed in honest and fantastic ways, showing the diversity of the character and the way in which he interacts with the people trying to help him in his life.<br/><br/>His genius is undeniable, but his person is generally flawed. He is charming in the most unnaproachable way...his world is made up of loyalty to his close friends. It is a safe world that keeps his immense intelligence out of the limelight, he is just one of them.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is brilliant as Will Hunting, as he illustrates the emotions of the character so vividly, you feel as if you go on Will's journey with him. His ability to write co-write the script also writes volumes for his artistic intelligence. His performance is helped by the truly excellent Robin Williams, who gives a performance on a par with One Hour Photo, or Good Morning Vietnam. He is immensely believable, the park bench scene is one of the most raw and touching scenes in recent cinema, and the background of the character is identifiable and a constant source of interest.<br/><br/>The support of Minnie Driver is classy and fulfilling, as there blossoming relationship is so believable. And co-writer Ben Affleck is superb, in his only acting role of merit, as Will's best friend.<br/><br/>The Oscars were well deserved for this excellent and beautiful film, any argument that champions this as an American dream style film or a corny coming-of-age love story, has missed the point of the film. It is about potential, redemption, loyalty and love. Truly brilliant film."
"jdavisbruin","7","0","2","30 November 2005"," Damon + Williams + Math = Strangely, Brilliance
","In case you haven't seen Good Will Hunting (it's OK...I hadn't seen it until 3 weeks ago), it tells the story of a poor Bostonian young man named Will, played by Matt Damon, who has had an incredibly turbulent life and whose social status prevents him from achieving something. Though Will is brilliant and should be attending a school like MIT, he mops its floors instead. After getting into some trouble with the law, a MIT professor who needs Will's help to solve a perplexing mathematical equation takes the young man under his wing and helps Will receive a lighter sentence, providing he goes to a therapist. After seeing many shrinks, Will finally meets with Sean, played by Robin Williams, who eventually guides and befriends the reluctant Will.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is by far one of the most intelligent, well written films I've seen in a long time and it's quite deserving of its Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Moreover, Robin Williams shines as the psychologist who is struggling to battle his own feelings of loneliness and worthlessness after the passing of his wife, and Damon is incredible as the hard-edged genius at the core of the film. Minnie Driver is also very likable as Will's girlfriend who constantly tries to get him to open up without angering him in the process.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend Chuckie is downright annoying. He tries to steal each scene he's in by screaming in his thick Boston accent or by stepping on the lines of other actors, but he fails to be compelling or interesting. I think I actually groaned every time he appeared on the screen. Still, overall Good Will Hunting was a thoroughly enjoyable film."

","This film easily ranks as one of my all time favorites. The script is brilliant, the performances are genuine and powerful. Actually, powerful is the best word to describe this film. After the first viewing, I felt an overwhelming aftertaste of euphoria. There are so many valuable life lessons you can glean from this tale of a ""super smart"" yet troubled young man (Matt Damon)who finds the complicated simple yet the fundamental aspects of social human interaction very difficult. Given the fact that Matt Damon also co-wrote the screenplay (while in his early 20's) with real life pal and co-star Ben Affleck is even more impressive. I consistently find myself shocked to hear that some have not yet experienced this gem. If you love movies, you must see this movie. I can't seem to stop singing it's praises even as it approaches the films ten year mark.<br/><br/>In short, if you haven't already seen this film, find some quiet time, rent it and savor one of the highlights of cinematic history."

I have tried Will's chat up line myself, but with no joy!<br/><br/>Also, i heard that the Dog Track scene, mini Driver actually placed a bet on the dog that won the race in the film, hence a smile on camera that cant not be staged!<br/><br/>If you like (simple) but very real films you will love this first film by both Ben & Matt.

You wont see Ben Afleck this good in any other movie, and Robin Williams is outstanding. It is a movie.

","Every now and then you come across a movie that though including some classic clich√©s, still manages to stand out and really affect you. Somehow this movie achieves just that. One can think that there's nothing special about this move. That there's nothing more to it than beats the eye. Well I beg to differ.<br/><br/>I first saw it back in 2003 and was completely absorbed by it. Back then I even considered it one of my favourite movies of all time. I saw it again this morning however and have to admit that it's maybe a bit too convenient to like sometimes. The overall great plot has some flaws, but it's still a great movie. I wouldn't go so far as to call it my all-time-favourite, not even close, but I still think of it as ONE of MANY personal favourites.<br/><br/>One of the factors that make this such a great movie is that it includes top notch acting. Damon and Affleck are really great along with both Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Robin Williams who put on tremendous acting, especially Williams. But alongside them I have to say that Minnie Driver as Skylar also brings something to the deal that is well worth appreciating. She has this natural charm to her, that is quite unique and adorable.<br/><br/>Except from the great and talented acting, I fell for the plot. It appealed to me. Inhere also lies some of the clich√©s, but I feel that they made it in such a way that they get away with it. I don't now how. Can't really put my finger on it. But it works. They pulled it off. I found myself drawn to the mix between drama and humour, and was mostly intrigued by the relationship that develops between Will (Damon) and his therapist (Williams).<br/><br/>There's something rather fascinating and inspiring about this film. I highly recommend it. I wish I somehow could capture the essence of the film and express it to you in a better way, but I guess you'll have to see it for yourselves. At least do that and make up your own opinion about it. It's worth that much. And even though you against all odds :-) should disagree with my judgment, I doubt that you'll find it so bad that you'd end up regretting you watched it."

Hollywood has become a frat boy house where no one cares about where we're going in the human race. No one cares period. They just want to make money and have their little power struggles. What made this a non-Hollywood movie was the genuine feel of Matt Damon and Robin Williams - nothing glamorous, just real interaction. Definitely cried in the end like everyone else.

","I was amazed by this film. A story of a young man ,who has a brilliant mind, but finds it easier to use his fists in any situation. I was very engrossed by this film, especially when Damon, the main character and Williams, his psychiatrist have sessions together, discussing Hunting's painful past.The romance between Minnie Driver's character and Matt Damon's is very gentle, which helps the audience to relate t them as characters. The only thing I objected to was the amount of unnecessary use of swearing. Swearing is often used for dramatic impact and effect or to portray the society in which a film is set , but I found the fact that every other word was a swear word quite off putting and useless. Other than that I found the film enjoyable and humorous in just the right places. My favourite part is the scene with Williams and Damon where both men embrace and Damon's emotional barrier is cracked, allowing him to be liberated from his brutal past. Affleck's part is easily as important as Hunting's friend. Such sensitivity. What a beauty!!!!!!!!"

To be honest I did enjoy the film, I thought the script was really good from damon and affleck and Williams performance was top notch and worthy of his Oscar. It was quite heart rendering. The fight scene on the baseball court was not very realistic, and even though Matt played the character of will being a disturbed and lonely young man very well, I didn't feel like he would be the person who could possibly scare anyone. I love the scene on the park bench and the conversation between Will and Shaun, and Shaun stating that just because he has read Oliver Twist it doesn't mean he understands what will has been through, excellent. Overall I really enjoyed the movie and was impressed."

","Finally I watched the long-awaiting movie. As what I expected, it did not disappoint me. Although a genius can have high IQ, high EQ can not be assured. Smart Will had serious mental problem. He could not make good use of his talent. On the contrary, he was abandoning his life. Even his friend Chuckie felt unhappy for that. What he said to Matt on the construction site just proved that their relationship was so deep. I was moved by it. I believe that it is satisfying if you have such a good friend.<br/><br/>In fact Sean also had his unsolvable problem. Due to Sean's patience, Will began to accept him. It was the trust between them that changed their lives. Honest communication made them can overcome their respective problem in the end. Without trust, I can not imagine what our lives will become in reality. No trust, no friend. If you want to own a real friend, trust is necessary.<br/><br/>Robin Williams deserved the academy award (the best supporting actor). Matt Damon was as good as his The Talented Mr.Ripley. Another similar excellent movie is Finding Forrester.<br/><br/>Although it is not a masterpiece, it is absolutely worth watching. 8/10"

Mini Driver plays the girl will wants, who is an intellectual who can merge into a group of lads, as when she tells the oap's 50th anniversary present joke. She also has a mean laugh!!! Will is an interesting character and he portrays the idea that even though you may have a skill, its not worth using it if its going to make you unhappy. You should do what will make you happy in life, as long as it doesn't hurt other people. Id happily watch this film again, its a romantic comedy,tame type of film you have cravings for sometimes."
"cheerskep","Null","0","2","5 March 2005"," GWH as a case-study in saving a non-active ""protagonist""
","I find GOOD WILL HUNTING immensely engaging throughout. And from the point of view of a writer analyzing the script, that's amazing -- because Will, the ostensible ""protagonist"", lacks two of the usual defining traits for that role: he is acted-upon far more than he acts, and he has no ""story-goal"".<br/><br/>Early on he solves the hallway problem, he picks the fight in the playground, rescues Chucky in the Harvard bar, and pursues Skylar. From there on he coasts, until the end when he makes his one and only life-bending decision in the movie: He leaves Boston to go see about a girl.<br/><br/>To those teaching story-craft, I suggest it's more useful pedagogically to hang the label ""protagonist"" not on Will, but on Sean, the therapist played by Robin Williams. Will is little more the protagonist than, say, the ""Mona Lisa"" would be in a caper movie depicting a bunch of guys trying either to steal or save that painting.<br/><br/>Sean does have an announced story-goal: Save the kid. And he acts-on Will until he, Sean, achieves that goal. (Sean also has a personal need, though it's one he's not aware of: He, like Will, has to be saved. This amounts to another story-goal the audience wants to see achieved, and again it's Sean's effort that achieves it: In the course of saving Will, he saves himself.) This view is of interest to more than academics. The practicing writer ¬ñ and directors and dramaturgs -- should study just how it's pulled off ¬ñ having a lead character who's essentially passive, and yet who holds and satisfies our attention throughout. GWH is a good case-study in how to break a craft-rule and survive.<br/><br/>GWH footnote: The ""official"" version of the screenplay published by Hyperion does not have a single scene, not one, that's identical to the movie as released."

","Good Will Hunting, a story of the profoundly gifted Will Hunting will resonate with all who still hunt for good will in the world. Stunning performances by the headliners; Driver, Daimon, Affleck, Williams, and those by actors not so well-known, make this original story by Daimon and Affleck unforgettable and real. Set across the disparate social contexts of the intellectual elite of MIT University and the impoverished blue collar world of South Boston, this story reveals that love, once again, transcends all. And love is its subject; the courtship, delights and follies of lovers, the love shared between men, the love for the natural beauty and truth revealed in science and mathematics, the platonic love between teacher and student, parent and child, and the violence and perversity of love betrayed.<br/><br/>This academy award-winning ""best original screenplay"" had a solid and natural up-bringing. Daimon and Affleck grew up in the widely diverse cultural context in which the story is set and their penetrating view of this world brings it credibility and importance.<br/><br/>In what is perhaps an unlikely assemblage of scenes and dialog, this classic story of struggle in pursuit of love and meaning is delivered by the strength and brilliance of the performances.

But at a rainy Thursday night there was nothing on TV except Good Will Hunting. Hearing some people say how good this movie was made me want to give it a chance. So I did. Thirst I must that the acting is pretty decent here, even Ben Affleck (who I normally can't stand) seems to know what he is doing here. Robin Williams gives a marvelous performance and so does Matt Damon. I already knew how talented Matt Damon was when I saw him in Rounders and the Bourne Identity, but I think this was his best performance I have seen so far. The dialogue of the movie is superbly written. Some of the sentences really make sense and go deep. The story isn't bad and the character development is also very good. The direction is fair enough although I didn't really pay attention to that. Maybe I even overlook the 'Psycho' remake incident. No not really!!!!!!<br/><br/>But still this movie is very good and I sure recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie once in a while. Grade 8/10."

","There have been many stories and cases about someone being mistreated/ abused/ abandoned as child growing up to hate the world, hate everything around him, and being disillusioned. In this movie, the protagonist, Will (Matt Damon), with that kind of past, is a mathematical genius working as a janitor at MIT. A Field's medal winning professor at MIT recognizes his talent and takes it upon himself to nurture and nourish it.<br/><br/>There are some serious loopholes in the movie. First, Will, though totally self educated, is shown to be genius at anything he can lay his hands on-- from history, to law, to organic chemistry, to, of course Maths. And all this while fully self educated. Its far more difficult to believe when, in the movie, he is mostly shown hanging around with his no good friends, picking up fist fights, drinking, getting in crimes, etc. I can understand amazing talent, yes, but even for that talent to show off as well it did in his case, the mind needs to be free from all this distractions. I can't help wondering how, he, in spite of all this disturbing things currently going on his life, he manages to do that. This is rather unreal to me.<br/><br/>Historically, the geniuses talked about in the movie and compared to Will (Einstein, Ramanujan) both didn't come from broken or abandoned families. Yes, both were geniuses who started of doing something else and were recognized late as geniuses, yes -- but that was because of social or educational systems in which they grew up that didn't recognize or encourage their merit. They could put their minds fully in the scientific or mathematical problems they were working on.<br/><br/>There are more clich√©s -- like the bar scene. I have something similar at ""Harvard"" bars, yes, but what is shown in the movie is rather exaggerated. Then, when referring to Ramanujan, the Maths Prof signs of the dot on forehead to indicate Indian -- thats a silly and stupid! MIT (and boston area, that has the BHCC too) has always had a lot of Indian maths profs and students, and while that action might have been understandable in the middle of cowboy country where no one may have seen an Indian for real, its difficult to imagine someone who works with so many Indians to give such a stereotypical description.<br/><br/>Then, the Maths prof himself, and his apparent inability to understand the effect of Will's past. Most MIT profs I know are more sensible than that. The relations between the faculty and the folks grounds dept (where the latter is seen swearing at the prof after he leaves) is much better here, and there is much much less swearing than is seen in the movie!<br/><br/>Wonder what the Bunker Hill CC folks thought of the movie, since in a way, it pits MIT against BHCC.<br/><br/>Still, its a good watch, and personally -- I can relate to somethings in the movie!"

","This story about a tough orphan who is an absolute genius struck a familiar note for me because Hunting (Matt Damon) reminds me of my father. Born at the turn of the 20th Century, his mother died after his birth and his father became such a drunkard and tyrant that my father left home at age 11 and did not complete school. A roughneck, stevedore, prize fighter, lumberjack, gun slinger, cowboy and rodeo rider, he finally married at the beginning of the Great Depression at the age of 30 to society girl and concert pianist who gentled him down. After I was born he sought a more stable and safe occupation and became a carpenter. He took correspondence courses to complete his education eventually getting his degrees in civil and construction engineering,<br/><br/>I knew he was smart in mathematics but I didn't know how smart until I took a geometry class from a teacher that was a retired professor from the University of California. One day he gave the class an problem that had never been solved. I took the problem home and asked my father if he could help me with it. Within an hour he had solved it. My professor was amazed. He gave me two more unsolved problems and my father solved both. Like Hunting he was an absolute mathematics genius. Nothing more came of it. My father was a brilliant construction engineer and that was his calling.<br/><br/>So the movie had a tone of authenticity to it. It was a good story although at times it was a bit contrived. I am not a fan of Robin Williams but his performance in this movie by itself made it worth watching. If there was a negative it was Minnie Driver who was miscast. Because she is an ugly duckling, perhaps that is why she was chosen but her acting and her accent were atrocious and I had to knock off a couple of stars on its rating. Otherwise, it is well worth anyone's time to watch."

","I've noticed that this movie has received some harsh criticism.  First of all, if you watch the movie and pay any attention, you can see that the story does make sense, and the casting works (I don't think they ever mentioned anything about an Irish gang).  Is the story believable?  Maybe. But the writing is good enough that it can get you to think, which is important.  Also, any movie that can get such strong feelings from viewers, good or bad, has made an important statement.<br/><br/>The acting, particularly Robin Williams, is definitely top notch.  If Ben Affleck could find half that level of integrity again, he might have a new lease on his career.  This was the movie that (in my eyes at least) really established Matt Damon as an actor that could hold a movie almost singlehanded.  And, while I'm not often a big Minnie Driver fan, her stark contrast to Matt Damon's character definitely livened up the movie.  I can never really tell if the Academy picks them right.  But I do know that this was a good movie.  It doesn't weigh you down with anything especially sappy or depressing.  It just tries to tell a story."

Look, there is no way anyone who is a genius will work as a janitor.  There are people who are smart or have potential who are also very lazy.  But even the most brilliant people can't read books that fast or memorize everything.  Remember the bar scene where he embarrasses that Harvard kid?  The guy didn't look or act like a Harvard kid.  He looked more like an MIT student, a science geek.  Many Ivy Leaguers are liberal and would be friendly to a poor bum.  In real life, Harvard students protested so the low-wage workers at their school can get better pay.  Then Matt Damon's character knows every quote from a book in a battle of intelligence with the guy.  Give me a break!

","""Good Will Hunting"" portrays a powerful struggle of a young man (Matt Damon) who is a math prodigy with decisions about life's lesson.  Trouble never seems to be far behind him when choices are steered in the wrong direction. No longer being of free will to make his own decisions, the only choice for Will is to be placed in a state penitentiary or to complete psychiatric therapy for his anger management issues. Determining a correct path in his life is not the only decision which Will must face as a young adult, but it can be one of the toughest.  While facing the judicial system, Will must make his anger work for him, not against him. This is a huge obstacle in maintaining friendships while trying to reinvent himself.  Will has the potential to become an elite mathematician, but instead uses his free will to experience his own road in life.  Although choice is a powerful tool, unless used to the fullest positive potential, it can possibly back-fire.  Decisions are faced everyday in each of our lives, but some of us take for granted the gift of decision and free will.  While being given a great gift one could consider Will as a man with potential, but no desire or initiative.  One might consider this the ultimate dilemma in life. The realistic `view of the working-class' is portrayed throughout the movie, providing a sense of belonging to the millions who fall in this category.  The setting was a bit predictable, which led watchers to feel the connectedness.  The dialogue might be appealing to a younger generation, who use vulgar words to express themselves, versus an older generation who find this repulsive.  All in all, I give this movie an A-."

","The dialogue in this movie is riveting because it gives you a feeling of a chess game of wits and rhetoric, set in modern times. I agree with others who've said that the movie's draw is that basically it's a well-written essay on the extent of the power of the intellect. Will Hunting at first seems like an omniscient god, but the question keeps coming up: so why is he a janitor? The answer is that no matter how much you know, you cannot go anywhere without trusting other people. You can't find love all by yourself; you have to have faith on someone to return it. Will's problem is similar to being rejected by girls over and over again: the hurt/pain tells you it's not worth it and fate will let you down anyway. Anyway Will thinks that by not trying to take his life anywhere, he's playing it safe. The thing is, he's right in that it is the safest, most controllable thing to do. He should see, however, that it is possible for people other than his childhood buddies to love him unconditionally. He refuses to see it, until Sean without asking or warning simply shows love. He didn't ask for it but he got it anyway. That is how you move a genius."

Robin Williams' excuse was that he had already played his cards and doesn't regret a minute of the time he spent with his wife despite the great pain he feels now. Matt Damon is in utter confusion, not knowing how to commit to anything in a serious manner; instead pushes everything out of his life as a defense mechanism.  It can be said that both use this super-philosophy to supress what could be a genuinely lively and thriving future, as a means to not love to the fullest potential.

Finally I watched it in whole now on 21st Nov 2003.<br/><br/>Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a genius for whom most of mumbo-jumbo math and O-chem is ""just a joke"". He works as a janitor in MIT and solves a problem written on the board in the passage he mops. He is discovered by Prof. Gerry who gets him out of jail (assault charges) on two conditions 1) Will Hunting works with Prof. Gerry 2) He sees a therapist.<br/><br/>Will has a tough shell around him which he doesn't let anyone crack open and trespass. He is cocky, abusive and least bit considerate towards Prof. Gerry's attempts at polishing him into a Genius who can be of use than a Genius who just ends up being a construction worker all his life. Enter Robin Williams and the rest is for you to watch. Must watch.<br/><br/>Robin Williams plays his role so well that you forget you are watching a movie, you forget he is an actor and not a professor or a psychologist. This happens to me each time I watch a Robin Williams film. The sessions that Robin Williams and Matt Damon have are some of the best parts of the movie and the last session where Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) finally succeeds in opening up Will Hunting is the best scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The character of Will hunting seems to be complex but it is not really. Why would a genius not want to work for some big company or the US Defence and make millions or billions? Why does he just wanna be what he is? And it frustrates you as the viewer, while ur trying to find the key that would open him up. Ur frustrated waiting for him to stop being so arrogant, why the hell can't he be a bit 'nice' to these guys? Ur trying to be a detective, and trying to find the great reasons. And that is how the script brings a mild suspense and tension to itself, mild.<br/><br/>Minnie Driver, the English girl is an amazing actress. She is such a normal girl, who laughs loud and can still be gentle and she is very smart too, and vulnerable. U think why is Ben Affleck doing whatever he is doing in the movie. Ben Affleck answers this question brilliantly in a scene that works as a catalyst in the transformation of Will Hunting's character. Stellan Skarsg√•rd (Prof. Gerald Lambeau) who takes up the challenge of refining the Gold ore that he mined shows great patience. One would really feel for him and his passion for math, especially if ur a lover of math.<br/><br/>This is one of the best stories and a very well sketched script. Go get a DVD."

At the end of the movie, when Ben's character goes by Matt's character's home to pick him up for work, and Matt is not there, you can actually see the light bulb come on ... very slowly ... while watching Ben.  Well done.<br/><br/>Cool story.  I don't know what it is referred to in a story, script, or screenplay, but I am noticing it more and more, and it occurs in this movie too.  What I am referring to is when something is explained in one context earlier in the movie so that it is more fully understood later in the movie, usually for a very emotional purpose.  In this movie, some of William's brilliantly rendered dialog concerns telling his buddies he has to ""see about a girl"" when meeting his future wife for the first time, instead of seeing game 6 of the World Series.  This dialog is very emotional.  So, later, when Matt uses the same line, all is understood with little said. Elegant.  Same concept was used in Rock Star concerning ""taking a pi$$"". But, the best I have ever seen this done was on the last Cheers episode that Shelly Long was on when Dianne and Sam were saying goodbye.  She supposedly was only leaving for a few months.  He says ""Have a good life.""  She explains that he says that as though they will never see each other again, which we know to be the reality as does Sam, though he won't admit it. She has explained the meaning of the phrase to us the viewer.  She asserts, she will be back.  After she is out of earshot, Sam says again ""Have a good life"" letting us know the finality of their relationship.  One of the best pieces of dialog I have ever seen!<br/><br/>But, back to GWH, I think it is a very good movie, and well worth watching. Very impressive for them (Ben and Matt) to have done."

","I viewed some of the previous reviews, where people seem to have a very off view of this movie, and that may be because of the big named actors in the film. I vote this movie as a 9, there is no justification to rate it at a 1. This film was not sent to be made because of damon and affleck, but is what made the famous to begin with. So please, thank the academy, and if you want to see a film with humor, drama, a bit of fighting, with a touch of love and friendship. See this film."

","I am a full-time sculptor living and working from my studio in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. Over ten years ago I moved to Northern California where I met, at a gallery opening, the American Poet William Leach. We fell in glorious love and eventually moved through New Mexico, Iowa and to Canada where he died at age 45 years of age, 6 years after I met him, we were married in hospital one year before his death. While in California he told me the story of his life including a story about being a janitor and some of the 'events' that happened during that time, he also mentioned that later friends had spoken to him about the interest in making a movie about his life, which he had no interest in, in fact the chaos this would have caused in his very private and reclusive life as a poet. Later when we were living in Iowa a friend said we had to see a very wonderful movie about a 'genius janitor' and told us the basic story of the movie. We both were in shock! This was the movie, years later, about William's life at that time. He was never able to watch the movie although he tried, but tears would stream down his face, and when I finally asked him, gently why he cried, and why he could not watch the movie, besides seeing all his friends depicted and recalling that time of his life in such detail, he replied, ""I had so much to offer and I was pushing a broom"". And we never spoke of it again. I think it is important that people know at some point in history that the movie was based on a real person, a very amazing person of great personal strength, a beautiful person filled with love for the world he lived in, and such a gifted poet. He wrote 6 books of poetry, all remain unpublished, he received news of 7 poems to be published in Descant, in Canada, the day after his death. If anyone has any interest in contacting me to learn more about this man, a Renaissance of splender and joy, please contact me, he was the 'genius janitor' depicted in the movie, ""Good Will Hunting"", and his name was William Leach, poet. Thank you! Susan Murar."
"writerbwoy","Null","0","2","23 June 2003"," Simplistic, Elitist Heartwarmer
","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>Every time I see this movie I can't help focusing on the elitist premise. I still love it, but it's getting harder and harder to get carried away with it.<br/><br/>Ever notice how everyone in this movie is either a violent, profane slobs or cultured elites? The two characters who seem to belie this (Will and Robin Willams) are really just fallen elites: Williams, one who wandered far from the ivory tower and ended up teaching at Bunker Hill Community College; and Will, one savaged by the blue collar world he was born into.<br/><br/>Indeed the point of this movie is to bring Will and Robin Williams back into the fold, because how could anyone actually finding teaching at a community college rewarding? Or construction and demolition? My Word, that is for the lower classes.<br/><br/>Perhaps by dint of their natural talents, Will and Robin Williams don't belong in the worlds of community college and construction. Fine, I could buy that, if the Affleck and Damon hadn't felt the need to paint those worlds with such a broad and unflattering brush. To show the Bunker Hill Students as slack-jawed fools the first we enter William's classroom. To have William's character leave pack up and leave the hopeless, intellectual black hole that is their screenplay's Bunker Hill CC. To have not one character outside the elite-working class polarity, like a middle class college grad (not from an elite college)? Minnie Driver's character was an opportunity to aerate this suffocating polarity, but Matt and Ben saddled her with a trust fund and med school.<br/><br/>Would it have been a tradegy if Will--after being counseled and helped by Williams--went back to southie? Or went back to his construction job? Is his working class life so utterly irredemable? In Damon and Affleck's simplistic, MIT-Harvard-Ivy-League-or-nothing world, yes. Will's genius is nothing if it cannot be utilized by the establishment. I mean look at the alternative! And his reward is a big-breasted, big brained English babe and all these companies he interviews with at toward the end are willing to pay him.<br/><br/>It's not surprizing that Affleck and Damon came from middle to working class backgrounds to write this. Indeed, the most rabid snobs are usually those from humble backgrounds who achieved vast success. And nothing aggrandizes that success more than showing the ignorance, sloth, and violence from which it escaped.<br/><br/>Anyway, I wish I could still enjoy this movie the way I did six years ago."

Although I'm skeptical that this movie really deserves a 10 from an artistic perspective, I don't regret my vote, because I think this movie is the embodiment of what moviemaking is all about.  It tells an incredible, human story in an honest, deep, and very enthralling fashion.  Also, I think the acting is just amazing, *especially* by Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and Minnie Driver.

","Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is the janitor at the most prestigeous college in the country. He is also the most brilliant person there. He solves incredibly difficult equations in minutes, where it took others years to. He is well read in history, mathematics, and art. But spends his days drinking with his buddies. It is not until one of the professors (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers his genius, that his life starts to turn around for the better. But he also has alot of anger. As a part of Will's probation, he must see a shrink (Robin Williams). Will also meets a girl (Minnie Driver) that seems to be his soul mate. With the help of Sean the shrink and Will's best friend Chuckie (Ben Affleck), Will acknowledges his potential and his abandonment issues. This movie is very well written and acted. Most especially by Damon and Williams. It shows that even the most complex person can find solace and understanding in others, if he only opens up. The movie was nominated for 9 Academy awards, it was truly one of those special feel good movies that had a message.

","This is a sound satisfactory performance from all involved. <br/><br/>For first timers, Damon & Affleck do well but the real chemistry sizzles between a laid back Robin Williams & Damon. Williams returns acting to the old Hollywood style of gestures and emotive expressions and says a lot more with his eyes, demeanour and personality. <br/><br/>This is a defining moment for Williams who convincingly breaks from the slapstick comedy gamut to settle into a thoroughly serious role and gives the performance of a lifetime. <br/><br/>The scene where he breaks thru Damon's chaotic personality with the mesmerising but calming ""It's not your fault, it's not your fault"" just blew me away<br/><br/>I came away feeling enriched by the entire experience, with a lot of admiration for Affleck and Damon but with great respect for Robin Williams.

"philipdavies","Null","0","1","7 May 2003"," Brainless romance of brilliance-by-numbers
","The intellectual endeavour that is pure mathematics gets mopped-up, in this film, about as mechanically as the floors our janitor-hero swabs in the College where he works: He idly solves a conundrum left by a professor in order to test the ability of his undergraduate class to their limits.<br/><br/>Our hero can't take anything seriously, though, - least of all an ability that should command any number of excellent, albeit not necessarily academic, occupations - because of an abused childhood. He seems an unlikely combination of colossal arrogance and extremely low self-esteem. This does at least lead to a glorious put-down of some dim rich kid who is nerdily annoying a girl. This is easily the best scene in the movie. The pay-off, when he exhibits the trophy of her 'phone number to the bested contender, saying, 'How d'ye like them apples?' sets up a likeable, if difficult, underdog whom we really want to get to understand.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was the only good scene. The intriguing personality of a lad with enormous ability, but a wayward character born of social deprivation, and his anticipated moral struggle to control his mental endowments, is never developed. To put it another way, his character was<br/><br/>never properly conceived and identified in the first place, and so can never be shown developing out of the contradictions of his creator's original confusion.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that the film half-wants to be another florid paean to the Romance of Learning, along the lines of 'Dead Poet Society'. The presence of Robin Williams - thinly-disguised under a pair of cartoon-shoulders that could only have come out of Popeye's spinach-tin - keeps reminding us of the inspiring teacher he was in that much more reflective (if imperfect) work. But the teacher in 'GWH' is a bland cipher. We shall see that this hopelessly scuppers the film.<br/><br/>In 'GWH' the acquisition of knowledge is presented consistently as being no more than a superior party-trick, the accidental product of a photographic memory. Or even as some virile clash of champions. We see this most absurdly in such scenes as that of the dismissal of the 'great mathematician', after he has been effortlessly bested in the solving of an even bigger and nastier mathematical conundrum, by our young turk: This obviously shattered individual reels off to recover from the mental devastation of being so utterly routed. Presumably he will end his days like some punch-drunk boxer, doing menial tasks, such as mopping the floor, perhaps, - now totally unfitted to draw his inflated salary as a star academic! Or this absurd shoot-out of ten-gallon brains might put us in mind of the baddy in some Wild West circus turn, humbled by the white-hatted radiance of the heroic cypher! There is certainly no inkling, here, of the collegiate pursuit of knowledge. There is no dawning engagement with the wider, grown-up world. There are no shadings. There is no reflection. There is not a particle of reality.<br/><br/>This is mere intellectual philistinism and immaturity. As bildungsromane, this film is the equivalent of the 'Rocky' fight stories. The character's development is told purely in all-American terms of adolescent virility - he is, and remains, a 'regular guy' who is true to the common experience of an intended audience of equally immature peers. His actions are authentically animal, at least, while, on the other hand, his thoughts are nothing more than pure automatism, bereft of the intellectual effort that would only pollute the blond beast so beloved of Americans, handicapped as they often seem to be by a profoundly insecure self-image. It is in order to reform, not his thinking - which is completely incidental to this drama - , but his social behaviour, that he is being granted the boon (as here it appears, rather than as the right!) of education. His therapy is political, intended to indoctrinate him into conformity with general social mores. It does nothing to render him a fit candidate for a higher degree.This alarming, if unconscious, exposure of this creepily conformist agenda, that is at the heart of America's bone-headed populism, is perhaps the only factor making this film worth consideration at all. As a source of sociological reflection on our great neighbour, it is quite alarming to observe herein how readily American youth appears to subscribe to its own enfeeblement.<br/><br/>What a devil's bargain is offered our Everyman of America: Self-realisation through Education - but only, and expressly, through the Trial of Therapy, that uniquely American tool of totalitarian thought-control. It is as if we are being given a re-make of 'A Clockwork Orange', in which we are unblinkingly asked to applaud the perversion of the unruly but human potential of Alex into the bland, neutered and utterly soulless citizen of a society of the like-mindless. This is what 'GWH' implies, by its deliberate confusion of education with therapy. Where 'Dead Poet' inspires (albeit in a rather 'Reader's Digest' fashion), 'GWH' prescribes. The pervading niceness that comes over our bright bad boy is every bit as creepy as 'Clockwork Orange''s brainwashing scenes - more so, since the picture seems blithely untroubled by this perversion of true, organic character development.<br/><br/>Even the more wayward knights of King Arthur's Round Table were expected to actually study discipline, and team-work, and to understand why they should submit to the judgement of their intellectual peers. Even the mad fantasist of Robin Williams' 'Dosser King', in Terry Gilliam's Arthurian subversion of all-American values, demands submission to his testing discipline only in order to restore Jeff Bridges' character, whole, to himself. Nowhere in the juvenile film at issue is the getting of wisdom represented as what it must be, even for the brightest students: 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration. But the American way - the Hollywood way, at least, - to self-realisation is to overdose on emotionalism, as apparently only pure sensation can lead Americans to the true goal of all human fulfillment. Mathematics is not even a witty McGuffin in such a childish formula. And the sprinkling of other cultural references provides no more than high-toned decoration - an impatient short-hand for the engagement with serious and difficult cultural issues, which are entirely absent from the pretentious, adolescent, Ed Wood-scale of artistic self-delusion on display.<br/><br/>Hence the spreading soft-focus of the film, after the first few establishing scenes, and the increasing redundancy of a plot that was never honestly posited on intellectual endeavour at all.<br/><br/>So: Just another Hollywood fairy-tale, without any of that haunted, grown-up sense of darkness that makes a film like Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' such a powerful fable of the human soul.<br/><br/>A superficial, brainless teen romance of brilliance-by-numbers."
"cbaumert","9","0","2","20 April 2003"," A great amount of respect for this simple, yet profound work
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck deserve a lot of credit for this movie.  One reason they painted such an excellent portrayal of life as it really is or could be, may be attributed to their youth.  Youth facilitated this film with universal themes of the transformation from youth to adult, and to balance the rebelling nature of Will Hunting, Robin Williams adds (with a very well developed character) the humbled but wiser soul of an older man. Even though Will being so naturally gifted at math seems a little out of the ordinary, it is supposed to be this way. The movie takes this abnormality and uses it to make everyone realize how much like Will they are.  Math may not be your strong point or your weak point either, but this characteristic of Will is simply an example of a trait that could cause any type of tension or problems in the life of a person.  I especially love how Williams' character is written into this same theme so that personalities young and old clash. This is one of few movies that can truly move me emotionally every time I see it, and it is because it can be related to every human that ever lived."

Not just believable but IMPORTANTLY so.<br/><br/>Contrary to our mad rush to find the minimal acceptable and attempt to improve the self image of the mediocre, Talent DOES exist.  It could be, should be, thought of as the key attribute of man.<br/><br/>And truly talented people CAN teach themselves anything and everything - I learned early in life to use the word genius with caution, when a frustrated (and slightly jealous) teacher said to me as a precocious pre-teen ""It is not enough to be a genius (Very High IQ) you have to be a genius AT something"" - and that is true, so I will not describe Will as a genius but very talented.  One salient point of the movie was Will's trave(ai)l from talent - IQ genius - to being a genius AT something.  You know as he's driving off in the wonderful gift from Affleck (who I did think was very impressive, maybe a touch more than Matt) THAT was to become the quest, the search for his proper role / accomplishment / (and yes, contribution). Even though we are encouraged to think it is Mini Driver he seeks, it is himself and that ultimate of all, creative accomplishment (as mathematics can be as creative as sculpture and music).<br/><br/>This understanding and acknowledgement of original talent is also discouraged as we have turned `Education' into a self serving, institutionalized, industry that sells knowledge rather than disseminating it.<br/><br/>One of the best lines in the movie is when Will tells an imitation scholar student that he will eventually discover, if his parents haven't already, that they are spending thousands (hundreds of thousands) to teach him things that can be bought by a talented person with three dollars in overdue book fines from the library.<br/><br/>Perhaps that was what made it such a great movie for me, I've been there, all of it, South Boston and the hallowed halls on Mass Avenue.<br/><br/>I started sitting in college class rooms - auditing - while still a young teen.  Had to play hooky from ridiculous `High' School to do it. In fact, I can even appreciate Will's `attitude' as today's society evermore dedicates itself to conformity and forcing same regardless of talent.<br/><br/>Made a pain-in-the-a!! of myself by correcting the professors and knowing the answers before anyone else.  Never paid a dime in tuition (even ignoring a bill for campus parking in Cambridge) and got tested out as a Masters in Engineering (by a short lived program from the ASME that was undoubtedly squelched by academia because they weren't getting their piece of flesh).<br/><br/>I DO know whereof I speak, and the `mathematician' is just another one of those jealous of talent.<br/><br/>THIS IS A VERY GOOD, if not downright great, MOVIE!"

","Good Will Hunting is an excellent movie that provides a real celebration of the human spirit.  Will Hunting is an everyday Joe, who works as a janitor in some college. Despite his meager lifestyle, Will (played by matt damon) is extremely bright and has a gifted and interesting outlook on a number of things. He ends up being sent to a psychatrist, played by Robin Williams, and thus a story about this young man unfolds. Despite very strong language and some crude humor, you start to get inside this guy's head and really relate to him.  Underneath his hard shell is just this soft, sensitive guy wanting to be loved.  With best friend played by Ben Afflek, who encourages him to get up and leave his life as a shmuck, and girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver, who loves him, he starts to realize he could be making something of himself. A truimphant ending will leave you with bittersweet tears. A stifling performance by the whole cast who was wonderfully chosen. 9 out of ten!!!!!!"

","I thought that Ben Affleck and Matt Damon did a tremendously good job writing this movie. They both also did a good job acting in it. I also thought that Robin Williams deserved that Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor because he did an excellent job. Someone might wonder, do they really need to swear that much? But they do because Will and his friends are supposed to be living a tough life and you imagine that they would swear a lot. So because they do swear so much, that proves that Ben and Matt are very good writers and in my opinion they should write more scripts in the future, whether it's together or separate, even though they probably would do better together. So over all this movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

I wish he would do more of this type of material and less clowning.<br/><br/>However, the credible story, realistic characters, and excellent script beautifully played by the cast are restrained by a glossy presentation. Anyone familiar with the coastal Northeast (story takes place in Boston) knows overcast skies, wind, rain.

I've read it many times since and each time, I still love it.  However, for some reason, the executives at Miramax failed to see that letting Damon and also Minnie Driver have roles in this movie would be a mistake.  Affleck is a good actor, although his part sucks in this movie but Damon went and wrote a whole story about his character and then failed to deliver. There were a few positives.  The friendship between Affleck and Damon does spill over into the movie and it does leave an impression.  Robin Williams is great.  I mean, the man can do anything. Comedy, drama, anything.  But the rest of the cast is pretty much mediocre except for Ben Affleck who also was good in Chasing Amy. In all, this movie was OK but nowhere near as good as the hype made it out to be.

","Perhaps many people have placed too much emphasis on this movie.  I am not saying this in a derogatory way.  The characterization in this movie is brilliant.  Matt Damon and Robin Williams give outstanding performances, although they do become a little predictable by the time that the movie is over.  Perhaps this movie is just that: a characterization.  The plot allows us to look at a man that is intelligent; far more intelligent than the average MIT student (as supposedly proved in the theorem-solving part of the movie).  Like an action movie star, the main character allows us to look at someone that is unlike us.  This goes for the character that Williams plays. We look at a psychologist with a type of awe: perhaps they see an insight into the human psyche that no one can (supposedly).  The problem is that: the movie is full of characterization.  Even though there are a few people that Damon plays running around the streets, we look into his life, and are forced to like him.  Going out on a limb, I am saying that this movie is like a Steinbeck book: the characterization is superb, but the other elements are lacking.  Don't let this movie escape you though, it is worth seeing the characterization alone.  By the time the movie is over, you will feel that you know the people intimately.  That is the reason that I give this movie a 6.8 out of 10"

The on screen chemistry between him and Affleck is a joy to watch, Affleck being far less intelligent than Damon's character yet having more common sense and seeing that Will Hunting was just wasting himself is an interesting angle.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Robin Williams is one of the most under-rated serious drama actors, though gaining plaudits for his comedy work this is as good as his excellent role in 'Dead Poet's Society' and the dialogue between him and Damon is spectacular. It kept me interested throughout the film and brought sympathy to an arrogant character.

The profanity was not that excessive if you spend any time at all with many lower to middle-class people around the age of the characters.  In fact, it was downright realistic. As for the acting, it was wonderful watching Damon portray this character who has to struggle with what he thinks he wants, what he is told he should want, and what he finally realizes he really wants.  No, I don't think it was the best performance of the year, but it was definitely one of the top five and worthy of a Best Actor nomination.  The chemistry between him and Minnie Driver was electric, particularly during their first date and again in the scene in her apartment before he leaves.  Robin Williams, in my opinion, delivers his best performance.  Sure, it's the typical Williams-drama character from Dead Poets Society and the like, but this character was better with the mental games and interactions with Will.  The best part of this movie was watching the relationship develop between Will and Sean.  This wasn't an epic movie, nothing too profound, but it was a small movie about love, relationships, and finding yourself, and in this capacity I think it was wonderful.  9.5 out of 10."

","""Good Will Hunting"" (1997:***). For awhile, I didn't think I was going to like this movie; there are too many clay-pigeon stupid jerks introduced simply to be demolished by the superhuman intelligence of Will Hunting (hated that bar scene, especially). It's a relief when Robin Williams finally shows up as his therapist, because you sense that this cocky but self-destructive kid has finally met his match.  The heart of the picture is the prickly relationship between these two, even though it does lead to the inevitable (and still potent) breakdown scene in which the mixed-up young man cries on his therapist's shoulder (e.g., ""Ordinary People,"" ""Prince of Tides,"" etc.).  There are almost as many scenes in this movie that don't work as do (the dreadful one in which Hunting substitutes Ben Affleck, as his best friend, for himself in a job interview should have been cut). But a good supporting cast and some tangy Boston atmosphere helps, and Matt Damon finally does win you over.  This is also one of Robin Williams' best dramatic performances.  He really anchors the film.  I'd be interested to know how much input he (and others) had on the original screenplay written by Damon and Affleck. All-in-all pretty good."

It's a well-written, well-acted story with deep characters that you care about.<br/><br/>Even the least-developed main relationship, Will and Skylar's, was profound. The torment that Will brought her in the end merely reflects his own, and you can feel that.<br/><br/>I'd love to see a sequal (Better Will Hunting?) to see what they do with Will/Skylar.

Good Will Hunting has one of the most original screenplays of the last decade and it's not surprising the fact that its fans are mostly young people. It deals with a very serious matter and manages to examine its every aspect. It's a fresh and original movie, the kind of those we want to see more in the cinemas. Matt Damon is of course the core and the soul of this picture. He co-wrote the screenplay with Ben Affleck and managed to persuade the 'big-bosses"" to make it a great movie. Demon is excellent in the lead and truly deserved the Oscar as his portrayal of Will was utterly realistic.<br/><br/>Robin Williams is equally impressive in the role of the doctor and proves that he can be better in drama than in comedy. But the true revelation of the picture is the great Minnie Driver. She too gives a realistic and heart-warming performance that allows her to be regarded as the most talented actresses today.(Her performances in ""Grosse Point Blank"" and especially in ""The Circle of Friends"" also prove that) Good Will Hunting is along with ""The Wings of the Dove"" undoubtedly the best picture of 1997."

The script and attendant dialogue carry the viewer along logically, both with respect to Will but also the Robin Williams character.

","Some people here have commented on why the characters in this wonderful picture swear so much. They believe that it's unnecessary and takes away from the movie. But they are wrong. The cussing in this movie is only part of their background. It shows the imperfections in them, and their words are backed up by their actions.That's all there is to it. <br/><br/>   Now to the movie itself. This is absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Matt Damon did a marvelous job of playing the flawed but gifted Will Hunting. Will is flawed in that he pushes people away, he doesn't allow himself to become emotionally attached to anyone. Where he is gifted is in his extraordinary mind. He and Minnie Driver have great chemistry, and both are able to take complete control of their characters and play them to the fullest. Will is a complex character that will keep you entertained the whole movie, and in my opinion, I believe that Damon is a much better actor than Affleck. Too bad he has not gotten the attention he is worthy of.<br/><br/>   Besides the excellent performance by Damon, Robin Williams has also proved his ability to play completely different characters, and seemingly with out much difficulty. Before watching this movie, I thought Williams would continue to remain in childhood films such as Hook and Jack. Characters that were always happy in a way. In this movie, however, he plays the troubled therapist, Sean Maguire, a person still grieving over the loss of his wife to cancer. The scenes with Damon and Williams light up on screen, for both of these characters need each other in order to move on. You'll understand when you see the movie. Williams deserved the Oscar he got for portraying Maguire. <br/><br/>   Is there a lot of swearing? Yes there is. But who cares? After seeing a movie like this, you'll have a feeling that these people are no longer trying to waste their lives, but move forward. I highly recommend this movie. Enjoy!<br/><br/>MJR"

","I've seen this movie seven times already, and each time I like it better. It is also the only movie thusfar that has brought tears to my eyes and left me unable to make some kind of wise-crack to release the emotional tension (the moment Will Hunting breaks up). Everything about this movie is brilliant: the photography, the acting (what a performance by the ever so irritating Robin Williams, whom I forgive all the Flubber, Jumanji and Robin Hood-crap for this flick), the story, the dialogue, the music.<br/><br/>The story starts of as a no-good punk teenager drama, with lots of swearing but already the emotional weakness of the characters can be sensed underneath the tough surface. It then develops into a story which beautifully explores how difficult it is to love someone if you haven't had a loving childhood, and are inclined to distrust people. Out of fear of betrayal, out of a desire to keep control all the time, Will Hunting (a superb Matt Damon) first tends to settle for nothing rather than to have the high peaks and of course the great downs that inevitably come with relating to people other than himself. In the end he learns that his first option in unliveable, through some sublime dialogues with his surrogate father, the psychiatrist (thank you, thank you, Robin Williams) he gets to know<br/><br/>Then there is the music, of course. Very seldom have I seen a movie that had such appropriate music in it as the Elliott Smith songs: as well textual as musical After seeing this movie, I've started buying his work like a madman, and I can assure you: it's worth the buy!"

He is a young and a very talented actor that can hypnotize his audience almost at will.  This movie could not have been successful without the supporting cast of Williams and Affleck.  Driver may not be the ""Cameron Diaz"" but she is certainly a talented actress.  The scene at the lake with Robin Williams' ""uncut"" extended performance is just jaw-dropping.  The amount of depth in the character development and the complexities of the plot spun by this movie is just simply amazing and sensational.  This movie is an exclamation point.

","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are accredited for winning the Oscar for Best Screenplay for the film Good Will Hunting. Directed by Gus Van Sant, the screenplay is brought to life very skillfully and with poise. While both actors had a part in its conception their involvement does not end there. Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, is a disillusioned and seemingly lost orphan genius from `southie.' His friends, i.e. Chuckie played by Ben Affleck, are his only support in a world which is very cold to Will. Will's emotions and frustrations come to life through violent rebellious actions. Robin Williams plays the role of a psychiatrist who helps Will to find his place in society, and inevitably the `good' of Will Hunting."

","When I saw this film at the movies, my friends and I were all set to see some film about a giant boat sinking and tragic love, blah blah. Lucky for us, the seats were all taken for that one, and so we agreed on Good Will Hunting, with all but one of us not knowing who these Damon & Affleck people were.<br/><br/>This theater was also filled up (to start with anyway). Let me say to anyone reading this that I live in the buckle of the Bible Belt. That being said, the first 10 minutes or so of this film saw a gradual emptying of the seats, with many a disgusted snort from my fellow moviegoers. The so-constant-it-was-mind-altering barrage of the ""F"" word was hard to take at first. Not that we'd never heard it before, but it being used so carelessly and often was shocking. However, being too cheap to try and buy tickets for a later showing of Titanic and too chicken to ask for our money back, we endured. After my head stopped swimming & I refocused, I was really genuinely glad we stayed.<br/><br/>As aforementioned, this was the first I'd heard of Matt Damon or Ben Affleck. I found both of these young men to be excellent actors and they have proven that many times since this film. The fact that they wrote this screenplay and saw it through to production and were able to star in it is pretty amazing also. My favorite part of this movie had to be the scenes between Mr. Damon's character and that of Robin Williams. Robin Williams is simply divine, in my humble opinion he is almost without equal in his chosen profession. He and Mr. Damon moved us all to both laughter and tears. Each actor cast in this film played their parts with excellence. Good Will Hunting is superbly written, fantastically well acted, directed and the cinematography was wonderful also. The cursing, in retrospect, was really part of the vehicle that gave you a sense of place in the film. I've since learned (from a native of the Boston area) that this is the way certain groups of folks from around there commonly speak. I hope you will excuse our ignorance here below the Mason-Dixon line. If you are from the South and were warned away - don't be afraid, this really is a mighty fine f**kin' film!!"

When I look at this movie, time and time again, I get carried away every time.<br/><br/>The conversations are high-standing, yet completely ""every-day talk"" and common. No fine script-scentenses here, only regular dialog. This makes the movie more realistic than some other drama's. And the way story's are told; pure genius... Think for example of the way Sean talks about his wife, or Chuck tells about his uncle. And, really brilliant: Seans monolog in the park...<br/><br/>The acting is (dare I say it?) perfect, or at least very close to that term. The expressions on faces, the body-language, everyting. Very clear about the film is everybody's position in the movie. Every person has his own personality, and it's very clear what their motives are.<br/><br/>Another apect that is very well worked out is the story. Not just a regular story, but a fine recognisable plot. Very great are the things Sean and Will have in common; their past, their fear of loving an(other) woman and so on.<br/><br/>Then there is the symbolism. This too is something they really thought about while making this movie. For exemple; Sean keeps buying this lottery ticket but never wins anything. They talk about the odds of winning a price. This refers to the great gift Will has; he symbolicly has a winning ticket, which is his gift. Or think about the way Will tries to figure Sean out by looking at his painting. Here he switchs roles with Sean, as he starts to ""see through"" the shrink, in stead of the other way around.<br/><br/>
So there are plenty of aspects which are pretty good thought through... Nothing to complain about, if you ask me. A movie to remember forever!"

Several reviewers don't even know the names of the writers. in my opinion, Good Will Hunting would've won Best Picture had it been released only a week later, putting it in 1998. readers of this review are probably thinking that i am some over-obsessed teeny-bopper. in some ways i am. i do think that ben and matt are ""hotties"". but that it not the reason that GWH is my favorite movie. i read the screenplay. i pictured the scenes as matt and ben may've pictured them. i recited the lines. i laughed at the jokes. i read background information, such as how they wrote it, why they wrote it, and why they cast the people they cast. i looked past the swearing, past the reviews, i saw the raw screenplay. all i had was that.<br/><br/>my copy of Good Will Hunting is barely one week old and has been watched in full, only 3 times. in those 3 times, however i have looked deeper. i looked at the actors, i listened to their dialogue, i watched their actions, i connected with the characters. many people were offended at the language, because it is real. not hollywood real, but really real. parents shield their children from ""four letter words"", yet they will let them walk out the door. the purpose of this review is not to yell at those who hated it, it is to convince them, look deeper. the purpose of the movie is to make people aware of how young men spend their time, how real people talk. Ben Affleck does not over exaggerate his movements, he does what he would naturally do. Good Will Hunting is more fact than fiction, the diologue, the people, the actions, they are are real. the plot was made up. in conclusion, i would like to say that only those true to boston can do a boston accent. and only an idiot would overlook this movie, or to label it ""over pulicized"". give Will a chance, i guarantee that if you look at the heart, you will find it entertaining. Good Will Hunting gets 10/10 and Matt and Ben get my respect. Have a nice day! KD"

","The story of this film is so simple (and contrived) , so everyday , so condensated , that you can write the plot summary on the back of a matchbox (!!!) . You see exactly what you KNOW that you will see . Nevertheless the result is very good and effective .<br/><br/>PLOT : Will Hunting ( Mat Damon )is a 20 year old with problematic domestic background . He lives alone and is a restless ""boem"" like character who has had a couple of problems with the law in the past . What many don 't know is that he is a mathematical genious and his IQ is much beyond average . When a professor in University discovers this genious accidentally , he wants to promote him . Of course Will is reluctant as always : he doesn 't believe much in himself and he refuses to cooperate. Naturally (as it always happens) his friends like the character of Ben Affleck encourage him to exploit his talents and leave them behind , since he deserves something better (how original !!)  "" You have the golden lottery ticket in your hands , but you are afraid of going to cash it in "" . Middleway he forms an erotic relationship with a girl (Minnie Driver) but (what a surprise!!!!) the relationship fails due to his unobediant and non-trusting character<br/><br/>"" So where are your 12 brothers ????? "" (!!!!) she asks him wanting to expose his lies and his lack of trust . Perhaps the most original part is that the lead attends a psychiatrist . After he changes 5 doctors (noone could stand him !!!!) he ends up in the hands of Robin Williams who was witty enough to push the proper buttons and finally communicate with Will . Robin Williams gives not only the best performance of the film but one of the best in his carreer . The session scenes are DEFINATELY the best ones in the movie . Although when the screenplay was written the filmakers had no idea who the role would end up to , now I really cannot think of anyone else than Robin Williams playing the shrink that successfully . The supporting cast is credible . They are simply there to serve the movie and not outshine the central character (intentional probably) . Mat Damon is quite good . He convinces mostly as a spoiled brat who wants to poke his fun to everyone , doesn 't want commitments with anyone and simultaneously he is a misunderstood genious who can't fit in anywhere : the incarnation of a problem child . As I said this is no classic (like Crammer Vs Crammer or the Rainman ) but is is one of the best social dramas (like the Prince of Tides ) Hollywood has ever made . The direction is subtle ( VERY subtle ) and so is the supporting cast . So if you add the cliches of the script what do you have ? I believe the movie lays on the shoulders of Damon and Williams . Their chemistry works and gives us a dramatic story with dignity and not melodramatic tensions . If you are not convinced there is at least one reason why you must see this film . ****SPOILER ALERT***** In the end we see something extremely rare : Will finally bends his lack of communication he bursts into tears . His shrink hugs him tightly like a father figure and tries to confort him ******* This is one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema simply because it is REAL (although none dares to put it in films because they don 't want to show a man crying) . Even for that GWH deserves a solid<br/><br/>8 / 10"

","Good Will Hunting is a realistic movie that has a message about people and life.  It works on many levels - the characters and plot are interesting as a well told story, the interactions between Will and the psychiatrist are revealing and compelling, and the questions it raises about life and lifestyle choices are deep and complex. I also really appreciated the relationship between the two friends. The conversation they have while working, when Will's friend tells him about his hope that Will be able to break free of this life, is so real and so beautifully done that I can't think of many film moments that come close. Robin Williams does a great job of creating a character who is flawed, yet incredibly capable of reaching Will and helping him to change his life. To add to the realism, the psychiatrist is also changed for the better because of his interactions with Will. Finally, the photography, attention to detail, and the incredibly good choice of settings and background helps to make this movie believable and great.  Everything just comes together so well, it should be considered the best movie of the year.  I give it 5 stars, the highest rating available."

Ok, this shields away most suffering, but it also blocks a great heap of happiness . Will has a hard time discovering his true potential and what his life can become. But, than again, so do we.

","What I heard about this movie prior to seeing it sparked my interest more than usually happens, the Oscars didn't really have a lot of bearing but they helped, and what is more I am not disappointed with it.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays a young Indiana Jones (IJATLC) sort of character, he knows history like the back of his hand, he can spout poetry, titles, quotes and even entire sentences from a specific book as easy as his name. With the winning script they do their best to avoid most of the cle she's, they do not glorify what he can do very much, just enough to establish the extent of it, they make a lot of mention of previous cases of genius discovered in a strange place just so that your disbelief retreats a little, and they down play the whole teacher relationship details and leave the inevitable kids change to accepting the teacher to a single, clear and early point.<br/><br/>
It manages to be attractive and entertaining but also with relevance to reality and people relationships. Wills trouble with accepting people does not come off as corny and unbelievable but one of a few prominent aspects that have front row seats. You really have to like the movie for it's rich entertainment status. One unsettling thing is the lack of conclusion to the ending but it is probably better that way, what was shown at the ending would make the difference between one category and another, it keeps the focus on the right parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Williams never really reaches great in his performance, he basically just plays a recessive person and sincerely states some lines, compare his supporting performance to say, Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter, there is a role with some content and depth, or, though I know this will cause trouble, Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, just as Crowe brought some winning depth to a done time-and-again character so too did Phoenix, through tears, amusement, heartbreak and rage he constructed an in depth performance. Williams win to some extent confirms the history of the award though, how did John Geilgud for his one track comedy role in Arthur, or Don Ameche for a single teary scene in Cocoon or Sean Connery for playing a mature version of the same character he had always played win, it's a career award, Williams has had an entire career of comedy roles and been nominated three times previous, such a change in this role and the fact that it was time brought the win.<br/><br/>Back on the movie, it really is cool, though not as impacting as Titanic it well deserved its nomination. This film gets a solid 8.5, it isn't 100% original so consequently can't take all the credit, but see this movie if you have not already, it is more than worth it."

","Personally, I found this movie to be a refreshing change from movies we see nowadays. Before seeing it I thought the basic premise was nothing new but Robin Williams might make it an interesting movie. I was delightedly surprised. Matt Damon pulled off a magnificent performance in a not-so-new character type. I found the plot to be a wonderful vehicle for the outstanding dialogue that made the movie so rewatchable for me. The screenplay absolutely deserved the Oscar. Robin Williams had easily one of the best performances of his career (at least as powerful as Dead Poet's Society if not more so). He poured a lot of emotion into a character just as complicated as Damon's. The connection between Williams' character and Damon's was powerful. Minnie Driver delivered a wonderful performance as Damon's love interest. Stellan Skaarsgard, though I don't recall another movie he has been, also played a complicated role as sort of a mental mentor to Damon. But my hat is off to Ben Affleck. This was the first movie I saw him in and his presence on screen was amazing. He is responsible for possibly my favorite scene in the movie, the scene where he tells Will Hunting that he doesn't ""owe it to himself, you owe it to me."" I believe he took the role as best friend to a new level. He also has a wonderful scene where he has to basically just stand there and let us know what is going on in his mind. I hope to see him around a lot in the future. This movie is wonderfully cast and brought me back again and again."

","This movie was so important in so many ways and it touched me deep inside. It was not overrated at all- hello it came out in the year of Titanic. I think it deserved Best Picture. It also launched the careers of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. (I love both- but Ben is awesome). They are both very talented and deserved all the credit they got. And Robin Williams ends up winning an Oscar with one of his only serious roles. How ironic? He gave the best performance of his career. Although Ben and Matt wrote it and everything- Robin just stole the picture. It wouldn't have been the same without his portrayal of Sean Maguire.<br/><br/>This was the feel-good movie of the year and just such a great story. You all should agree."

","Yes, the genre of the troubled genius given guidance in the finer aspects of life is a cliche.  Yes, it's somewhat predictable.  And yes, there's a lot of cursing.  However, all the other elements in Good Will Hunting help the film not only succeed, but soar.  <br/><br/>The script Good Will Hunting is the antithesis to the Hollywood system as we know it: Two talented young actors, yet to make their big break, come up with a polished, original, and personal script, rather than the screenplay-by-committee published by the major studios for the sole purpose of commercial gain.  Every line of dialog here, rather than succumbing to the pit of tired cliches, comes off original and with personality.  Every scene here, the characters relate to each other believably, while remaining completely engaging.  One of the best examples of this is in the fantastic scene between Will and Chuckie at the end about what Will would be doing in 20 years.  Through Chuckie's blunt honesty he shows us how true of a friend he really is, and the true depth of their relationship.  Outside of maybe Pulp Fiction, I don't think I've seen a script this original and absorbing in some time.<br/><br/>Robin Williams gives the performance of his career here, even topping his great work in Dead Poets Society.  Here, he's not the schmaltzy, kindhearted savior he's been in his last couple of movies.  Rather he's a good, intelligent, but flawed man who is there originally just to guide Will, but ultimately his experiences with will help him confront his own issues.  His performance is not superficial, but nuanced- knowing about life, but at the same time, not knowing, and learning along with Will.  Similarly, Matt Damon did a great job giving us the outwardly cocky genius-with-an-attitude that is deeply hurt inside and grows to show us that he doesn't know everything, but is willing to learn.  Ben Affleck is amusing and honest as his friend Chuckie, and Stellan Skarsgard and Minnie Driver do great jobs in their respective roles as well.<br/><br/>Looking around here, I see quite a few negative comments for this film. Frankly, I'm stunned.  The work of everyone involved in the film, particularly Damon, Affleck, and Williams, raises what could have been a complete cliche to cinematic excellence.  Everyone criticizes the Oscars for their dubious selections.  However, when they honored this script and Robin Williams' performance, they couldn't have gotten it more right."
"Dave-79","Null","0","1","13 September 1998"," Matt Damon proves how versatile an actor he is
","Damon carries this thing all the way, which is good because after all he plays the title character.  I watched ""The Rainmaker"" just before watching ""Good Will Hunting"" and I was blown away by the contrast of Damon's characters and the versatility of his acting.  First of all his southern drawl and Boston accent are wonderfully authentic.  This is important to the viewer who has to believe in the character.  Robin Williams would have been more believable if he'd have stuck with his own accent rather than attempting to muddle through one of the worst ""Baastan"" accents I've heard. It's distracting listening to him go in and out of it.  This is the only downer in an otherwise brilliant performance; his best serious role since ""Awakenings,"" which was a far better performance. Far too little attention has been paid to Stellan Skarsgard's performance.  He is wonderful in his role as the domineering math professor attempting to take Will under his wing.  Skarsgard's dialogue with both Williams and Damon creates some of the more memorable scenes in the movie. Other great performances include Ben Affleck, Minnie Driver, and Casey Affleck. I'd like to include Cole Hauser as Bill in this list, but he barely has three lines in the whole movie.  Over all this film is entertaining, funny, and original. It's refreshing."

","Good Will Hunting is a really good story, which makes for perfect cinema. A good story, a great script, and a super cast, with a fine director in touch with the material. <br/><br/>Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have concocted a great script which is both endearing and funny, while involving for the audience. Damon was fortunate to get the part of Will Hunting, but Affleck does show great class in the small role he has as Will's best friend Chuckie. <br/><br/>The acting, in fact is one of my favourite aspects of the film. Damon is a revelation in his role as the confused and bitter Will, who struggles to let anyone in his life, or get under his Boston skin. An Oscar nomination was justified. Williams achieves a career high with his portrayal of the shrink who helps Will find direction, while also allowing himself find direction too. Williams is perfect for the role, showing great vulnerability, and a soft underbelly. The bench scene where he has a two-minute take with Damon, telling him he's never experienced life outside of Boston, is a moving and enlightening scene made special by Williams. He deserves his Oscar. Minnie Driver was fortunate to get an oscar nomination, but she does show great feeling, and her part was well written to allow her space to make the part her own. She has an expressive face perfect for acting, and she does a good job.<br/><br/>Gus van Sant takes rather a back seat here, visually, to concentrate on the material and acting. He lets the actors show off their talent, and does a remarkable job in bringing out the best in them. Danny Elfmans score is low-key and carries his trademark, if bearing a theme or two from braveheart from time to time.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a great film, full of emotion, and humour and carries a great story along, which everyone can learn from. The characters are original, and the acting is stupendous. This is a must see film, purely because of its sheer class in every department."

Matt Damon and Minnie Driver are not especially convincing, and I did not see much chemistry between the two. I hope Matt Damon's performance in Rounders is better.

","It is interesting to watch ""Good Will Hunting"" again, nearly three years after its release.

This is due entirely to Matt and Ben's extraordinary way with dialogue and Gus Van Sant's simple  and very effective direction which places no barriers between the characters and the viewer.<br/><br/>I am sure that this, not the plotting, is what impressed the Oscar voters.<br/><br/>""Good Will Hunting"" remains one of the finest American films of the decade."
"jls2698","Null","0","1","26 July 2000"," Worthwhile Film (** Spoilers **)
","The statement, ""Better in execution than design,"" appropriately encapsulates ""Good Will Hunting."" Despite an apparent brilliance and creativity in discrete scenes and sequences, examined generally and on a macro level, the film's plot and directional structure lack severely. However, the characterizations, dialogue, and overall mise-en-scene project a unique tendency similarly absent in both mathematics films (recall ""Stand and Deliver"" as a blas√© manifestation of mathematical concepts to an audience) and ""Boy Wonder"" pictures (movies with a genius-laden protagonist; most are, much like mathematics films, merely adequate and not passionate about the qualities of their main characters).<br/><br/>The most effective parts of ""Good Will Hunting"" show the conflict between two sets of parallel individuals: Will and Chuckie, and Professors Lambeau and Maguire. The intense and latent rivalry between the two academics describes a potential future for the two twenty-year-olds. Maguire consistently, at least on a superficial basis, searches for the default respect the MIT mathematician receives. Will, although reticent and clearly an outcast, seeks a similar form of respect, although not for his academic qualities, but for his social abilities. Throughout ""Good Will Hunting,"" both pairs of spotlighted characters, after a series of enlightening ""adventures,"" become comfortable with themselves. Despite this banal-sounding narrative flow, the execution is mostly interesting and often unpredictable. <br/><br/>Similar to ""Jackie Brown,"" ""Clerks,"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" lines in ""Good Will Hunting"" sound realistic, albeit on a near-poetic and superlative level. Anecdotal portions of the dialogue are given a relaxed temporal frame with which to develop. (A standout instance is Skylar's last-wish tale.) Although the strong propensity toward vulgarities and obscenities is evident, it almost is rendered justifiable; lines are well constructed to ""ease the fit"" of the negative language that in many other films is overtly unnecessary and inappropriate. <br/><br/>The lyrical music, which relies on short minor-key short melodies rather than grand designations (a John Williams or James Horner variant), is appropriate for the film and functions effectively as a ""personal score"" for Will Hunting. Danny Elfman, who composed ""Bettlejuice,"" ""Men in Black,"" and ""Batman,"" has rarely shown restraint in his music. The reticent notes support the characterizations rather than defining them (as his other works have often accomplished).<br/><br/>Other than the mostly mediocre diagesis, the film's largest fault is the treatment of its logic in its supposed-main topic: mathematics. Ignoring the errors in the content (a Fourier series, the professor claimed, was to be the first problem on the hallway chalkboard. Instead, simple undergraduate Linear Algebra appears. Of course, this lapse is not noticed by most of the audience, and it does not alter the piece in any respect), more serious errors surface: If Will was another Ramajidan, as Lambeau claims, why was he not given any queries on anything more than an undergraduate level? How about assigning Hunting unsolved problems, like the Goldbach Conjecture or the Reimann Hypothesis? Certainly such mathematical questions should be enough to challenge a truly gifted mathematician."

","I think that 'Good Will Hunting', is one of the best movies, very moving and remarkable. I think 'Good Will Hunting' should have won best motion picture at the Oscars, because it was a lot better than 'Titanic'. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote such an incredible story, there's no way a movie could ever get as good as this. I have no idea how people can put it down saying it's dumb, no way, the storyline was unique to most others, and it had a bit comedy, loads of drama and cleverness. Robin Williams was so great and deserved that Oscar. I though Minnie Driver was very good also, and I have seen most of her films and she is now one of my favourite actresses. I thought Stellan Skarskgard was very cool, and flowed with his character. I don't care what anyone says, but this is a masterpiece and it should have won."

","""Good Will Hunting"" was not a bad movie at all, but I don't believe it deserved the accolades that it got. While I found that the acting was quite good, I didn't think the story was terribly engaging.<br/><br/>Bottom line -- Matt Damon's character did not gain my sympathy, as he did with most people who have seen this film. Essentially, we are dealing with a very smart kid who is also an obnoxious, unkind person. I don't care if you have a bad job or come from a broken home. In my book, those are not excuses to be a jerk. I personally know people who have had much tougher lives than Will Hunting, and they still treat their fellow man with the utmost warmth and kindness. <br/><br/>So with the main character not winning me over, I found I really had nowhere to go with this film, since it is almost entirely focused on Damon's character and his struggles. I didn't feel myself rooting for him, which was a huge impediment to me getting anything out of this movie.<br/><br/>
Again, ""Good Will Hunting"" is hardly a bad movie. I am certainly not saying that. However, I don't understand why people consider it to be so great."

The justifications for giving Good Will Hunting a low mark seem (in general) barely thought out and petty. Someone's assertion that Affleck and Damon simply couldn't think of what to say so they kept using the ""f word"" stands out.  Go to this web site's Good Will Hunting memorable quote page.  There is a reason why it is one of the longest of any movie featured.<br/><br/>Arguments that the individual story lines are unrelated and the ending is weak, lead me to believe you must have been trying to put moves on your date instead of watching the movie.  Instead, of giving us a hokey feel good ending, Affleck and Damon offer something much more insightful and honest. Will recognizes that he must deal with lingering emotional problems before he can be satisfied and successful in any profession. The ending is only a recognition of the problem, not a solution. So instead of neatly wrapped up closure, Good Will Hunting ends with something much closer to real life."

You see, to be in my video library, the film has to be SO good it will stand repeated viewing. This film is IN my video library. The script is very nearly perfect.  The message is true, and honestly told. The acting...PARTICULARLY Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and, of course, Robin Williams...is superb. Let me admit, I am a Robin Williams fan...almost against my own nature.  He irritates me at times, and frustrates me other times..and I'll be the first to say he's turned in some horrifically over-done performances.  Then, you see him in something like ""Awakenings""...and you see him in something like THIS movie..and you realize that Williams has the potential of being one of the BEST! Damon turns in a wonderful performance. Indeed, if it were not for the strength of his performance, Williams would probably still overwhelm the film.  As it is, there is a ""checks and balances"" thing that happens between them that is simply a joy to behold. Minnie Driver, whom I adored when she was X pounds heavier in ""Circle of Friends,"" startled me.  I hadn't seen her since she lost all the weight. Minnie is one of those faces that...let's be honest...can't be called ""fashion model beautiful"" ...yet she is (to me) a kind of real-world sexy. And her acting can be marvelous, and IS, in this film.  Her heartbreak is so real in one scene, I almost can't stand to watch that scene.  I have to leave the room and fiddle with a soft-drink or something. I want soo badly to sweep her in my arms and comfort her...now THAT's acting!  Ben Affleck is a perfect foil to Damon's character...and this very believable story (to me) is wound out in a compelling manner that literally leaves me drained at the end. This is simply a movie with lots of pluses and almost no flaws.  Given the story, its length is right...there are a few scenes that could have been tightened in my opinion (mainly between the math professor and Williams character)...but this is ensemble acting par excellence.

With it's budget a miniscule fraction of the Oscar winning best picture, Gus Van Sant and the writers, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, produced a picture with much more substance and emotion than any other movie that year. Critics have questioned the reality of this film.  Is it so hard to believe that there is a kid genius from the slums of South Boston?  As far as I'm concerned, the critics must be appalled at the idea that someone without a Harvard education could be so successful and so intelligent.

","`Sweepingly Smart' Good Will Hunting: rated R, 2 hours and 5 minutes<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the troubled boy-genius, Will Hunting. Will was an orphan and abused child who hasn't the slightest idea what to do with his incredible mind. He is janitor at one of the most prestigious school's in the nation, MIT, and anonymously solves an incomprehensibly difficult math problem.<br/><br/>While Will is put into jail for the beating of a group of teens, he is discovered at his work as the man who could explain the formula that no MIT student could fathom. The professor (Stellan Skarsgard) bails out Will under the condition that Will seek professional therapy, and promise to meet everyday to study mathematical equations. By the end of the movie, Will is molded into a decent human being, no longer lost in life; this is all owed to the ideal therapist, Robin Williams. Sean helps Will cope with reality in the present day, as well as the hardships he has faced in the past. With his wife dead, Sean finds himself able to relate to the similar problems of Will. Sean turns out to be more of a valuable friend than therapist.<br/><br/>Will finds that he doesn't understand himself, let alone others. It is only until he openly expresses his feelings that Will is able to find his place in life.<br/><br/>Good Will Hunting is a combination between drama and comedy. It is realistic in displaying the problems Will faces, but somewhat cheesy in proving Will's intelligence. Robin Williams brings out the sentimental side of Will, with some parts of this also appearing corny. Though Will can certainly be a tearjerker at times, the movie blends in many comical scenes, allowing the audience a little fun.<br/><br/>
The greatest part of Good Will Hunting is its sincere acting by Matt Damon, Robin Williams, and actual college friend of Damon, Ben Affleck, who plays Will's best friend in the movie. They all seem to play their roles beautifully and effectively, which is what makes the movie so good.<br/><br/>With its superb acting and memorable lines, Good Will Hunting, directed by Gus Van Sant, also starring Minnie Driver, is worthy of an A-."

"$thing","Null","0","1","2 October 1999"," Good Will Falling
","Falling flat is what this movie does, ever since the pretentious beginning: the attempt to capitalize on a presumed genius from the slums falls short of the target simply because while saying f*** every two words is true to life for more people than we want to know, a universal 'genius' as the one portrayed by Damon is nowhere to be seen, or conceived. The kind of 'knowledge' displayed by Damon is mostly fruit of dumb and trite photographic memory, and does not have the least to do with 'intelligence': as for the mathematical part it's pure fantasy, because Ramanujan may well have lived and impressed 100 years ago (mind me, he still impresses now), but would have a much harder time if he lived today. Speaking as a mathematician, it is shocking to see how carefully the movie tries to depict low life, and how easily it falls into the most stereotypical misconceptions about 'higher learning'. Overindulgence in realistic reproduction of a southie's foul language and scars, flanked by stale and flat portrayal of the MIT mathematics department may say it all: the script authors obviously share more with f*** than with f(x)."
"TheNGBCh","Null","0","1","2 October 1999"," Astounding, it is the realism that moves us
","Good Will Hunting was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen, dealing with themes of hope, potential and abuse it gave such a real-life portrait that almost everything in the film was something you could easily relate to and felt very familiar.  The choice of locations and backdrops were very appropriately atmospheric, as the film was shot in pubs, bars and coffee bars. The film was original and worked on a deeper level throughout, it was able to drop all the usual clich√©d characters and scenarios that populate so many of the mass bulk of formulaic films that account for the vast majority of Hollywood's output. This never strayed far from scenarios real ,and a storyline that could be related to, I first believed and then upon realisation wanted to believe that it was a true story, because the degree of observational accuracy on real-life and the familiar feel of real-life that is believable and credible ,the film had been quite remarkable. It is ironic that many people are not convinced that Matt Damon's character could be a genius and yet could have come from such circumstances of abuse and now be living such a 9-5 philistine lifestyle of laying bricks and nights on the town, as the film manages to persuade us that it is more than just the usual triumph over adversity case. It is a film about abuse ,and in it we are shown that the loss in normal family values and the resulting towing of society's line that that would probably normally cause ,brings up strongly other aspects of a person's character, and this might explain the heightened creativity or ability as depicted by Will Hunting. The story is very psychologically real and is refreshingly not so simplistic as most other popular films. It is so re-assuring to know that the films of this type can be made and can be profitable and that it doesn't always have to be the lowest common denominator that we so feared having a monopoly on the majority of films. He is a maths genius but he doesn't know it, he naively just gets on with it, just like Mozart with the box of wood known as a piano. But when he is discovered by a maths professor ,he must be brought out of himself, and his cocky, confident front that hides a deeply insecure individual whose fundamentals have been rocked by abuse. After being exposed to and brushing off a number of conservative and conformist psychologists he is brought under the wing of a very philosophical psychologist who he has some common ground with. Some of their procrastinations and profundities are alone worth the two hours. For a deeper, more philosophical film that will make you truly think and feel in this realistic view of human nature, there is Good Will Hunting."

","Good Will Hunting isn't a formula movie. It's plot has been used before, but it's wholly original. It's a wonderful character study about friendship, potential, love, and most importantly, low self-esteem. Most don't think about the low self esteem part, because Will was a cocky kid. But low self esteem was the whole reason he wouldn't capitalize on his gift. <br/><br/>Will is a high school dropout who works as a janitor at MIT. Gerald Lambeau put a problem on the board in the hall, and Will solved it. Before the Lambeau can talk to Will, he gets arrested for punching a cop. Will gets released into Lambeau's custody under the condition that he sees a therapist. He scares off a few (in some very funny scenes), and finally sees one who is much the same as Will. Through each other, they both learn to get on with their life, and put the past behind them. <br/><br/>The performances are some of the best of the year and even of the decade. Robin Williams does his career thus-best in this movie. He plays a father figure to Will, even though the script only once hints to this. He had some of the same past as Will, and he is not only a father-figure to Will, but a best friend, and even a brother. He had grown up in the same neighborhood as Will. He had been abused like Will. So, they related to each other on a different level than Will could with anyone else, and on a higher level than Will wanted to relate to anyone else. He spoke the same language as Will did, that was the reason Will would listen. <br/><br/>Minnie Driver received an Oscar nomination for her work in this movie. I thought she did career-topping work too. She had a very sketchy role, but did sorcery with it. She was excellent. She had opened her heart to Will, only to have it crushed. And then, after that, she still loved him. She didn't have the biggest role by any means, but she had an extremely important role. <br/><br/>Matt Damon through the movie. He gives the best performance in the movie, hands down. His character is desperate, yet afraid of answers to questions that he can't find in books. The role is so complex, that you forget that he had to act in this part. He had to play a dashing lover to Skylar, a genius, a good friend, and a scared kid, and put these together and come up with a convincing character. And Damon does that without trouble. He had us all crying like babies in a certain particular scene. You here people say, ""Oh but Leonardo DiCaprio deserved to win the Oscar or at least get nominated."" To me there was no comparison at all. Matt Damon was clearly better than Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought that Matt Damon was even superior to Al Pacino who deserved a nomination for Donnie Brasco, and everyone knows I love Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck has a small but important part in the movie. I personally think that he deserved an Oscar nomination for this too. He gave a great, near perfect performance. You don't have to have someone acting like they don't have enough since to come in out of the rain to give a good performance, and the whole cast shows it here. <br/><br/>Stellan Skarsgard has an important role as the mathematician who ""discovers"" Will. It must have been heartbreaking for his character, Lambeau to know what true genius is, and appreciate true genius, but fall short of it himself. It must have been heartbreaking to watch an abused, high school dropout, cocky, 20 year old kid do math in a second that he was completely in the dark about. And it must have been most heartbreaking to watch Will almost throw it all away.<br/><br/>The script of this movie was such a surprise. It was written by two actors, not screenwriters, who wanted to find their big break. Instead of waiting until the perfect part came, they wrote themselves the perfect part. The result was the best screenplay of the year. I wouldn't hesitate to put it within the 5 best of the decade. <br/><br/>Jean Yves-Escoffier does a great job as the Director of Photography. He shoots it in a low key, dark, close-up style that works effectively. It captures the dark, moodiness of Boston. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman does great work on the score. He got nominated for an Oscar, but this being his first ""normal"" movie, and plus being against Titanic, didn't help. It's a shame, I wouldn't hesitate to say that no movie was more enhanced by a score last year than Good Will Hunting. <br/><br/>Gus Van Sant deserves credit for directing it. I've heard it compared to Dead Poets Society by saying, ""I didn't even shed a tear at Good Will Hunting, but there wasn't a dry eye in the theater when I saw Dead Poets Society."" Now that's a silly statement. That doesn't say anything about the quality of the movie. The difference is the directors. Peter Wier, who directed Dead Poets Society, is a sentimentalist, and Van Sant isn't. As one very good reviewer put it, ""Gus Van Sant refrains from beating the audience over the head during the emotional scenes."" That's exactly right. Peter Wier doesn't. <br/><br/>In my book, Good Will Hunting is one of the 10 best movies of all time. It's one of the modern classics in my book. And if there's any justice, it will be in everyone else's book too. <br/><br/>9 Oscar Nominations: (Picture, Director, Actor (Damon), Supporting Actor (Williams), Supporting Actress (Driver), Screenplay, Editing, Song, Score )<br/><br/>GRADE: A+ ****<br/><br/>The best movie of the year.<br/><br/>(NOTE: I would highly recommend this film to everyone, but beware - this film is quite liberal in its use of the most notorious four-letter word known to Hollywood. If you still don't know what I mean, think of Joe Pesci. If you *still* don't know what I mean, you're innocence is amazing, and this film would probably knock you for a loop. )"

","This movie has an excellent script, great acting, superior dialog, and appropriate casting.  It's almost hard to believe that Damon and Affleck could have developed such an intelligent script at such young ages. Perhaps they got help? Who knows...and who cares.  The final result was a simply great, human, moving story. Robin Williams certainly earned his Oscar. The only faults I found in the movie was William's failure at maintaining the Boston accent consistently (yet his acting made up for it so completely, I STILL think he deserved that Oscar) and the somewhat labored idea of an alcoholic father being the root of a kid's problems.  The KBONE rating: 10."

Every award this film was nominated for should have been a nomination for The Ice Storm instead. The Ice Strom was interesting and touching on so many levels and it was filled with brilliant performances. This film interested me in only one way; why the hell did so many people like it?<br/><br/>At the end of this film we are supposed to think that Will has learned something. Well I hate to break it  you, but he's still an arrogant jerk. And Robin Williams, give me a break. The only good performance in this horrible movie was given by Stellan Skarsgard. Also, how can can script comprised of mostly the F-word win an Oscar?"

","Good Will Hunting was a movie that had everything in it. Everything that makes a movie good. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do the greatest script ever wrote. By far the best dialouge in any movie I've seen. Well this and ""Pulp Fiction"". The acting was great also. It was an all around good movie with alot of meaning to it. It's almost even a coming of age sort of film. The whole friendship between Matt and Ben really paid off. You could tell in the movie that they were friends even off screen. Great acting by both of them and not to forget Robin Williams who does his best acting job yet. Even Will and Chuckie's friends were good actors. Ben's brother Casey did a great job and that other guy, I don't know his name, but he was in ""Dazed and Confused"", did a great job also. So if you're in the mood for a good movie about friendship and relationships, I highly recommend this movie."

In a nutshell: bit by bit you start to understand you can't possibly understand what Will's life is about."
