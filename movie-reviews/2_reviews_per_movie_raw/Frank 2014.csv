"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","34","35","3 January 2017"," An odd film guided by pure truths, ""Frank"" is worth the weirdness
","""Frank"" explores the fine and not-so-fine line between creative genius and insanity. Although you might assume a movie about an alternative rock band with a lead singer who wears a giant fake head that he never takes off would be a work of fiction, the truth, as they say, is stranger, and provides a compelling basis for a movie.<br/><br/>""Frank"" is co-written by Jon Ronson based on his experience playing keyboard in the Frank Sidebottom Oh Blimey Big Band in the late '80s. Frank Sidebottom was the alter ego of a man named Chris Sievey, who wore a giant fake head almost identical to the one Frank (Michael Fassbender) wears in the movie. Ronson based the film's main character, Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) on himself; both real and fictional Jon found themselves randomly in this band, ditching their existing lives in pursuit of musical greatness, trying to make sense of the enigma of the man in the giant head.<br/><br/>With screenwriter Peter Straughan's (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") help, Ronson dives into a fictional replication of his experience with the band. Gleeson's Jon is an aspiring songwriter completely lacking in inspiration who gets an unusual opportunity to play a gig for an experimental band called Soronprfbs after he witnesses their keyboardist attempting to drown himself. Jon has the time of his life and agrees to travel to Ireland with the group, only to discover it's not a road trip to play a few shows, but a retreat at which the unorthodox Frank will stop at nothing until he's recorded an astounding new album.<br/><br/>For all the mystery shrouding his character, Frank is far from the most eccentric band member. In fact, he's the most congenial. We also learn about the other keyboardist, Don's (Scoot McNairy), volatile history with mental illness and musician Clara's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) propensity for violence. Unsurprisingly, Jon's gleaning from it all is that deep adversity and mental anguish is a pre- requisite to talent.<br/><br/>Director Lenny Abrahamson brings a natural yet surreal quality that honors the weirdness of the story, while also helping us access the psychology of the characters and take interest in what's happening in a very rooted way. He keeps the reality of what's going on with its characters in play while experimenting with a number of scenes that push the bizarreness to varying levels. There are elements of black comedy, but also of honest, soul-stirring truth.<br/><br/>The first half of ""Frank"" focuses more on the creative process and the mental headspace necessary to operate at peak creativity. When Jon signs them up for a very promising gig and begins pushing his own creative agenda, forcing the story to leave the confines of the Ireland vacation home, the film turns to examine the real pain of its characters and what happens to creativity when complications of fandom and notoriety enter the mix.<br/><br/>Throughout it all we see a gradual change in Jon as a character, and he becomes less likable because of all that his dreams and naiveté have wrought. This has a slightly adverse effect on the viewing experience, making it kind of painful to watch all these troubled characters with their misguided attitudes drown themselves in a sea of expectations and principles. At the same time, this leads to an honest, moving redemptive arc in the final half hour of the movie, when this bizarre flower of a story opens up to reveal its fragile insides.<br/><br/>""Frank"" can feel rough and disjointed tonally at points and grow a little irksome, but much like how a band with a weird sound still has artistic integrity somewhere underneath that drives that creative choice, ""Frank"" stays committed to looking at talent, creativity and mental illness in a very authentic, productive way that makes it worth the quirks.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"ello84","Null","25","28","25 November 2014"," A Frank Review
","I happened to see the trailer for a movie I had never heard of, called Frank, at 8:45AM this Saturday morning. Within five minutes of seeing the preview, I found that the Angelika Theater at Mockingbird Station was the only place in Dallas showing this wonderfully bizarre looking movie, and by 10:20AM, I was sitting in a dark room with about twelve other people, waiting to see just what this giant paper-mache head had in store for us.<br/><br/>Maybe I should step back to explain that last part. Frank revolves around an avant-garde musician names Frank, who is never seen without an oversized paper-mache mask on. The trailer promised quirky indie escapism, possibly some decent music, and some references to SXSW – ahhh, there is such beauty in under-promising and over-delivering.<br/><br/>For a brief moment, it feels like Frank will be little more than a stylized fictional Behind The Music type of movie because the central narrative is observed and reported from the viewpoint of an involved outsider, the new guy in the band. The outsider point of view is a perfect choice, however, because the audience then has the same questions as the narrator so we're all in it together. Is the end product of music/art as important as the process of creating it or who you create it with? Frank captures the ambition and compulsion of creating art and very harshly slaps away any generalizations of how or why an artist is the way he is. The paper- mache head isn't a gimmick for the movie or the music.<br/><br/>On the topic of music, Frank and his band The Soronprfbs, are easily ranked in the top five fictional bands – The Wonders(That Thing You Do), Stillwater(Almost Famous), Eddie & The Cruisers(Eddie & The Crusiers), Wylde Ratttz(Velvet Goldmine), and The Soronprfbs(Frank). The music falls somewhere between The Flaming Lips, Jim Morrison, and an extremely catchy coffee shop rambler.<br/><br/>The band is absolutely mesmerizing every single second they are on the screen and much of that credit has to go to Michael Fassbender. Because we can't see his face, every bit of emotion must be poured out elsewhere. Fassbender delivers an extremely physical performance. From the combination of his hands and voice, to the way he shuffles when uncomfortable, to the way he loses control when he sings, the small crowd that happens to see Frank this year will be seeing one of the best performances of 2014.<br/><br/>It has been almost two days since I saw Frank and I still can't get it out of my mind. Maybe it's the music or maybe it's the acting but I think the bigger reason is that it asks the questions I thought only I had. How does someone create something both abstract and powerful? What part of my brain should I be tapping into? Why can't I? Frank is a photograph of the special brand of artistic jealousy that wants to be or at least be part of something bigger and better than ourselves, all while realizing the privilege of simply getting to be witness to that greatness."
"samwardell","10","131","178","14 May 2014"," Reminded me why I go to the cinema.
","I went to see Frank at the Ritzy Picturehouse in Brixton with my wife. I was not expecting much; I tend to dislike rock biopics and the whole premise of man-in-giant-papier-mache-head thing seemed gimmicky.<br/><br/>Frank is wonderful. The comedy is effortless, the dialogue is smart but not pretentious, the performances are elegant and understated. Fassbender is great and the head thing really works for him. <br/><br/>One of the real pleasures of this film is its narrative depth. The story arcs of the protagonists manage to be wholly natural and yet surprisingly subversive. At no point does the film simplify or 'talk down' to the audience.<br/><br/>The music is good too.<br/><br/>Go see it. Go see it while it is still in the cinema."
"sav-982-72544","9","92","126","24 April 2014"," Frank is a thoughtful, imaginative and amusing piece of work making for a hugely watchable and enjoyable movie.
","Michael Fassbender dons a huge fake head in the enjoyable Frank showing at Sundance London. The movie is a fictionalised account based on a book written by journalist Jon Ronson who also co wrote the screenplay. In the 1980s Ronson played keyboards in the Frank Sidebottom Oh Blimey Big Band in which Frank wore a big fake head and nobody outside his inner circle knew his true identity.<br/><br/>In a small quiet English seaside town Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) tries to pursue his passion for writing songs in between working at his humdrum day job. Even given his undoubted enthusiasm for trying to be creative Jon struggles to actually write anything even vaguely resembling a half decent couple of lyrics. On Twitter he likes to tweet his songwriting status or more the lack of it along with updates on what he is eating for lunch. But when a band comes to town and their keyboard player goes off the rails he sees opportunity knocking to join the band for an actual gig. Shortly after he finds himself travelling with the band to Ireland to record an album which ends up taking him on a pretty epic journey.<br/><br/>Jon's new band members are a weird, odd bunch of characters which include the slightly crazed and volatile Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Don (Scoot McNairy) an ex-keyboard player of the band who now operates as a kind of manager, and then there's Frank the band's enigmatic front man played by Fassbender and who insists on wearing an over-sized fake head at all times.<br/><br/>Frank is a hard film to easily define and although it manages to remain on the right side of upbeat with plenty of laughs it does gently broach issues revolving around mental health. The exploits of the band trying to make a album touch on notions of artistic endeavour, originality and the sphere that songwriters and musicians have to encounter in trying to be creative.<br/><br/>While generally having to be the subject of suspicion and hostility enforced by most of the band Jon is encouraged by Frank's friendship and welcome remarks about his on the face of it tragically lame attempts at songwriting and starts to be become more emboldened about his actual merits and worthiness. Gleeson does a terrific job in portraying his character Jon's transformation and voyage from awkward geeky young dude trying hard to fit in, to feeling like he was the main man in charge of the band's destiny and even catalyst towards the success he so craves. Ultimately though a hard lesson in self discovery awaits him.<br/><br/>The movie keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next and trying to work out the main characters and how they interact with each other. In the history of bands there are lots of examples of artistic spats, personal issues and tragedies, conflicts, inner working quirks and inspiration which are all evident in Frank.<br/><br/>Summing up Frank is a thoughtful, imaginative and amusing piece of work making for a hugely watchable and enjoyable movie."
"ferguson-6","7","56","76","30 August 2014"," Inside the Head that's Inside the Head
","Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies fit pretty easily into a genre: drama, comedy, action, etc. This latest from film festival favorite Lenny Abrahamson is tough to classify. It begins with silly and funny inner-dialogue from an aspiring musician/songwriter (Domhnall Gleeson), transitions into a dark dramady with complex characters and dialogue, and finishes as a bleak statement on mental illness and the music business.<br/><br/>That's more than I would typically disclose, but some have described the film as an outright comedy and I find that unconcsionable. If you are expecting a laugh riot, you will not only be disappointed, but are likely to miss the unique perspective provided.<br/><br/>The screenplay is written by ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" collaborators Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. Clearly inspired by the late British comedian and musician Chris Sievey (and his character Frank Sidebottom), Mr. Ronson's work with Mr. Sievey is the driving force. It's also the reason Gleeson's character is emphasized over Michael Fassbender's titular character who dons the paper mache head for the bulk of the movie. This script decision probably keeps the film from being truly great.<br/><br/>The exceptional and attention-grabbing first 15 minutes set up a movie that dissolves into an exploration of the creative process within mental illness ... Franks states numerous times that he has a certificate (certifiable). There is also an ongoing battle between art and commerce, as waged by Maggie Gyllenhaal's character and that of Gleeson. Social Media power is on full display as this avant-garde performance art band gathers a huge following prior to ever really producing any music.<br/><br/>Without seeing Frank's facial expressions, we witness his transformation from mystic/guru to an unstable and socially uncomfortable dude striving for likability, but unsure what the term really means. Must artists suffer for their art? Why does society latch onto the newest social media gimmick? What is creative success and why are so many afraid of it? The film begs these and other unanswerable questions. Certainly interesting, but definitely not 90 minutes of laughter."
"magicninga","9","82","115","22 May 2014"," Frank - a weird but extremely rewarding watch
","Frank is probably the hardest film that I have ever watched to describe to someone who has never watched it. After viewing I had literally nothing to say. This is because it was a truly excellent watch. <br/><br/>I was initially attracted to 'Frank' by its strange and wacky trailer with promised an insane black comedy.<br/><br/>The first hour of Frank delivers on this completely and it is hugely entertaining. Some of the funniest scenes that I've seen at the cinema this year. This in my mind is properly revised comedy, until the film which is currently sitting at the top of the box office charts 'bad neighbours.' Anyways i digress.<br/><br/>During the last portion of the film there is a massive shift in the films tone, which could have easily been extremely jarring for the viewer but it is delivered in such a way that it only seems natural. This is when I decided that I did truly love the film. Not only was i capable of making me laugh but then also then to look at the more serious end of the coin. <br/><br/>I don't think that 'Frank' will make anywhere near as much money as some of the larger blockbuster which came out this week, but I done believe that it will linger in the memory of those who watch it. I can almost guarantee that Frank will become a cult classic over time. <br/><br/>(Also the soundtrack is bloody brilliant)"
"tr91","5","31","42","9 February 2015"," Funny to start but becomes very tedious
","Frank is certainly a film that I thought had a lot of good and bad points. The story is unique and Frank is a very mysterious character. Most of the film takes place in a nice remote setting which adds a great atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting throughout from all the cast is of a very good standard. Domhnall Gleeson was absolutely fantastic and executed the jokes to perfection. I particularly enjoyed when we heard his thoughts/updates out loud, there were very funny at the start of the film. The humour overall is dry but works for the most part. Apart from Jon's thoughts out loud I would say the hot tub scene was also quite memorable.<br/><br/>The film takes a tragic turn midway through and the band also progress. I felt that after an hour the novelty wore off slightly and it became very tedious to watch, I really started to lose interest. The second half of the film didn't really work for me and I felt disappointed after such a great start. The film wasn't engaging enough to make me connect to the characters as the serious stuff happened but it was very enjoyable when it was more on the comedy side.<br/><br/>A well made film with great performances that unfortunately lost its way towards the end. Some will love it, some will hate it and I can see both sides to that argument. Overall I would say 5/10."
"gsygsy","7","45","72","17 May 2014"," well worth seeing
","Funny, endearing movie led with a strange, flinty charm by Domhnall Gleeson, and expertly directed by Lenny Abrahamson. Within what is fundamentally a straightforward story, a lot of themes are packed - artistic credibility, the easy triumph of mediocrity, the nature of identity and individuality. And there are more. Too many, really.<br/><br/>The writers are keen to maintain a light tone, as if wary that the heavier themes might weigh us all down too much. Fortunately they have two major, definitely not mediocre, talents on hand to maintain the required balance: Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who are both amazing. For Fassbender in particular there needs to be a special award for succeeding in being intensely moving whilst wearing a false head.<br/><br/>So although the movie as a whole doesn't quite add up to more than the sum of its parts, it is nonetheless a wonderfully quirky, often hilarious, strangely touching piece of work. Well worth seeing and supporting."

","So Frank is a great film. Let's be clear, this is not a bio-pic. It was inspired by Frank Sidebottom in so much as the story is about a band whose front man wears a big papier-mâché head.<br/><br/>It's a really lovely story of an odd group of musicians and their new keyboard player Jon. The musicians are all a bit barking and the beautiful Maggie Gyllenhaal is the craziest. The whole cast are superb and Michael Fassbender is excellent under the head as well as showing that he is a great vocalist too.<br/><br/>The film is engaging, funny and moving.It also made me jump more than any horror movie ever has. It has some wonderful scenes that made me laugh out loud and the direction is just beautiful with some truly clever touches.<br/><br/>It starts with a very unusual aural soundscape that draws you in immediately and finishes with the band's songs playing over the credits that guarantee you won't leave until the final note of ""Lone Standing Tuft"".<br/><br/>Incidentally a documentary about Frank Sidebottom is in production right now and Being Frank: The Chris Sievey Story will be out soon."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","22","35","18 June 2014"," Sometimes the chances of being a little different or strange pay off and sometimes they don't
","The film Frank and its title character both offer a weird exterior but beneath the quirkiness is a familiar arching goal and story structure dedicated to resolving a psychological crisis. It could be a criticism of the film that it buries its conventional resolutions and codas deep beneath the strange behaviour of its characters. Yet it is also using this conventionality to express the truth and desires about the character Frank (played by Michael Fassbender). Although Frank wears a giant head to hide his face from the world and even the members of his rock 'n' roll band, underneath is an unstable but real person whose most relatable aims are to reinvent himself and his identity to achieve total uniqueness. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, from a screenplay by Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy screenwriter Peter Straughan and Jon Ronson, Frank is at its best when it finds funny variations on parodying the difficulties of the creative process. An artist isn't expressing their work to themselves but to other people. Is it more acceptable to be weird and unique, but detached from others, or generic and predictable? The way the film generates these questions after an initial viewing heightens its value and relevancy. <br/><br/>The film is loosely based on the experiences of its screenwriter Jon Ronson, who met the real life comedic character Frank Sidebottom. The Guardian posted an extract from Ronson's book Frank: The True Story that Inspired the Movie. He describes how in 1987 he was asked to fill-in as a keyboard player for the punk band The Freshies, led by Chris Sievey. Frank was Sievey's invention. On stage he would wear the giant papier- mache head and would only responded to being called Frank. The character wore a 1950s style suit and sang on stage with what Ronson called a ""high-pitched nasal twang"". Frank's story was that he still lived at home with his parents and his goal was to become a pop star. The character grew in popularity by covering popular songs and also by appearing on radio and television shows. In the extract, Ronson struggles to understand why Sievey kept the head on for so long and also the fluctuations in his weird and irrational behaviour. He likened Sievey to being transgender and trapped in the wrong body. <br/><br/>To protect Sievey from speculations about how obsessive he was about Frank, Ronson decided to fictionalise the film version. The differences in the real story and the film are sizeable. The film is set in the present day Britain, allowing for light references to social media like Youtube, Twitter and view counts. In the film Frank (Fassbender) has no alter ego. He is a mystery because he refuses to remove the head, even in the shower. This perspective of Frank is drawn from Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), a young man with a boring day job who is looking for inspiration for his music career. One day he is invited to play with Frank's band ""The Soronprfbs"". The band is compromised of Don the manager (Scott McNairy), who has his own fetishes, a Frenchman (Francois Civil), a female drummer (Carla Azar) and also Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who intensely dislikes Jon for moving in on the group. After a failed gig, the band takes an unexpected detour to a lakeside cabin in Ireland where they attempt to compose an album using Frank's unconventional methods of musical recordings and rehearsals. <br/><br/>One of the largest payoffs for Ronson and Straughan's script is forwarding the narrative a year while the group is in the cabin. The time shift is unexpected and lends itself to the film's thematic and comic structure: the friction between the band members as they sometimes hilariously fail to achieve artistic uniqueness. There is great variation in how the film draws humour from this second act. Slapstick is a strong device with Frank recording the sounds of his gumboots or a toothbrush or when Jon tries out a new method of shaving, which I thought was the film's funniest moment. Characterising the band members with black, self-deprecating nudges is essential in preserving the comic energy too. The way Don hints about Frank's unstable upbringing and his own quirks involving mannequins inspires some funny dialogue riffs on the way artists posture about having tragic upbringings and childhoods. There has never been a successful artist who wasn't miserable. While Frank is treated like an awe-inspiring idol of mystery, some of the side characters like Clara are as obscure because we see few other sides to them when they could have been more rounded.<br/><br/>It is slightly disappointing that the laughs don't carry into a shabby third act in America. Some of the disjointedness between the locations could be intentional to reflect Frank's unease and nervousness but it still feels dislocated from the previous two acts. The film also sheds a lot of its comic wit in favour of a more sombre and serious tone that emerges almost out of nowhere followed by a simple and easy conclusion that seems formulaic in its message about speaking truthfully to find proper artistic rewards. It is odd that the film starts to edge towards those same painful upbringings that it initially parodied. Perhaps with more time with Frank the man instead of the image it might have been a more moving ending to the story. Yet since watching the film, Frank has grown on me because of the weight of the ideas about creativity and complacency. It also relishes an interesting cast who aren't renowned for their comic traits. Sometimes the chances of being a little different or strange pay off and sometimes they don't. It is the joy and the pain of any art form."

"xzcgb","3","41","81","31 August 2014"," embarrassingly bad
","I met Frank Sidebottom in 1989 when he was doing a stand up comedy gig. He was nothing like the character portrayed in this film. I know, you say 'well that's not the point, it's based on him loosely'... OK but Frank Sidebottom (real name Chris Sievey) actually invented that false head in real life, it's his creation, his intellectual property, his own life is reflected in it. But this film shows a man from somewhere in the US, a musician only NOT a comedic performer, donning Chris Sievey's creation...which is taking artistic license too far!<br/><br/>Further, the film is not funny, not a comedy in any way, it plods along. All the characters are unpleasant, and the young outsider accepts all the insults given to him. It is very unrealistic in the sense that many of the events portrayed are unbelievable. e.g. the car crashes: the first one Frank conveniently escapes, the second our young hero conveniently (for the script writer) ends up in hospital. I do not believe this movie explores mental illness, rather, it shows us some people who comment on mental illness, who mention it. Neither the dark nor light side of mental illness is shown with any conviction, possibly because the direction and editing of the film does not allow us the viewer any time to dwell on such matters.<br/><br/>It spoon-feeds the viewer, from one scene to the next....and what was that scene with the box of food all about? were they trying to eat a tin of cocoa powder or what??<br/><br/>This film was a cheat. In my opinion it would have been a better and funnier film had it contained more of the actual Frank Sidebotom, the Frank from Timperley north England, the comedian Frank Sidebottom. As it was i found this an empty experience and a waste of good money Although a couple of scenes almost approached something pertaining to good cinema, overall it did not entertain."
"runamokprods","10","12","20","2 November 2014"," Odd, funny, sad and wonderful. Has stuck with me for days.
","An odd and wonderful mix of comedy and sadness, absurdity and reality, playfulness and originality. The acting is terrific throughout, the cast creating slightly larger than life comic characters that somehow still feel real enough to invest in emotionally. It's a tone few movies get right. ""Harold and Maude"" comes to mind. <br/><br/>Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) wants to be a pop star in the worst way (literally). He walks around writing amusingly bad pop tunes in his head. Life as a musician seems only a dream when as luck would have it a band, playing in his home town for just one night, needs a replacement when their keyboard player goes bonkers, and Jon is in the right place at the right moment. Thus begins Jon's journey with a band of misfits, who may be geniuses or just delusional... or both. <br/><br/>They are led by Frank (Michael Fassbender) an amiable if deeply odd fellow, who wears a giant plaster head that he never takes off, even to sleep. His counterweight is the angry, punky and edgy Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who is fiercely protective of the fragile Frank, and sees Jon's attempts to get the band to go mainstream as dangerous to both their artistic integrity, and Frank's well being. All this leads to adventures, changes, discoveries and insights that are often outrageous and darkly funny, but ultimately quite moving as well. <br/><br/>Also to be noted is just how great the music and songs created for the film are. They have to be ""off"" enough to be funny, but good enough for us to believe there really is something to Frank's talents. This is done very well, both in the writing and performing, the actors showing some musical chops, and the film creating tunes that, to my surprise have been caught in my head for days. <br/><br/>Indeed, the whole film has stuck with me far more deeply than I imagined while I was watching it. There's a haunting quality behind the humor that captures what special about ""outsider"" art, and it gives the film a resonance and gravity to go along with it's light-handed playfulness."
"muxmer","2","38","79","2 September 2014"," Did anyone actually hear the music?
","I don't actually have any way to start about this. The cinematography, the acting, the jokes (or lack there of) and the overall feeling are done quite well. The problem is, I didn't hear a chord of music worth listening or a verse that made any sense whatsoever. Then I realized that the movie is not about music at all, and that the whole thing serves as some kind of therapy, after you see that the keyboard player wanted to commit suicide, and a whole lot other crap happening with the members of the band. The first part of the movie looked like a mock to all the nowadays music and the musicians, showing the lack of talent and the ignorance in all of it. Afterwards, you realize that they're all mental patients and that it's not about the music at all. Now, after we digested this fact alone, what is left is still not satisfying or artistic. It might as well been a story about autistic children making charity gifts. There is nothing there to look at, honestly. As much as I wanted to have something learned and felt from the film, I only actually felt sorry for the characters, which is well not worth the money or the time. Sorry, Fassbender, this is a low for you."

","Graceful, melancholic, and sweetly charming even while being very funny, a fantastic film. Very meticulous in its pacing, it's restrained and surprisingly atmospheric too. The performances play a large part as to why it works so well. Michael Fassbender is definitely one of my five favorite actors working right now, he's given great performances all throughout the last several years, and this may stand as one of his very very best. I guess it's going to be hard for many people to look past the fact that we don't see his face (especially when it comes to awards season) but what he does with his vocal expressions is pretty magnificent, and a total transformation. Most times it hardly sounds like the Fassbender we've all heard, if at times even not at all. The only other male performance of 2014 to rival Fassbender's here is James McAvoy's turn in Filth. Domhnall Gleeson is also pretty great in a less showier part, especially great in the film's last act. Maggie Gyllenhaal has also never been better, although I admit that I haven't seen a lot of her work. This is truly great stuff, sad and funny in a way last year's brilliant Inside Llewyn Davis was. This also has a scene that is to me the hardest I've laughed this year."

","This is NOT a film about Frank Sidebottom. Quite how Jon Ronson, who co-wrote the screenplay and was supposedly a friend of the real Frank Sidebottom, allowed this film to be made is an insult to Franks's memory. Frank was funny, entertaining, played 'toytown' version of famous songs, and was only slightly weird.<br/><br/>Parts of the rehearsal sessions in the house seemed reminiscent of stories of the late Captain Beefheart virtually imprisoning his band in California whilst dreaming up 'Trout Mask Replica' - but there another set of similarities ends abruptly.<br/><br/>The music throughout is naïve and dreadful - and this comes from someone who is interested in many forms of experimental music.<br/><br/>If you don't know or care about the real Frank Sidebottom, you might enjoy this film.

","I never thought that anything remotely connected to Frank Sidebottom would leave me feeling angry but I can't remember the last time I was so offended by a movie.

Frank Sidebottom was a true one-off, and this attempt to hijack his legacy and re-package it for a twitter/facebook obsessed twenty-something market is preposterous. Now I need to go and listen to my Radio Timperley cassettes on full volume and sing Guess Whose Been On Match Of The Day at the top of my voice for an hour just to get this abomination out of my head. As the great man himself would put it, absolutely bobbins.<br/><br/>Perhaps we can look forward to the sequel, ""Frank 2"".

","I only have one word for this movie: pretentious. The way the band behaves while rehearsing, and their general approach to creativity, depicts nothing real about musicians. Not even with those very avant-garde types. Maybe that's the point with the movie and the message went over my head, but then it's not very well explained what the movie is about (and I do think the narrative and message isn't very hard to understand). I think this movie perfectly shows what happens when someone acts as if they were musicians."

This is a world in which gimmicks attract listeners, in which anything marginally odd is deemed revolutionary, in which bands remain unnoticed unless they pander to mainstream trends, in which talentless leeches saddle up to gravy trains, in which even the humblest men harbour dreams of celebrity, in which mental illness is misidentified as genius, in which physical and psychological disorders hinder artists as much as help them, and in which social media alters how music is consumed and promoted.<br/><br/>Though populated by fine actors (Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scoot McNairy in particular), it is Michael Fassbender who steals the show. Though we rarely see his face, Fassbender imbues his character with a range of emotions, Frank oscillating from godlike superhuman to insecure man-child. In Frank's mask, Jon sees what he wants to see: a legend, a God, a pathway to celebrity. The truth, though, turns out to be far more disturbing.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – To see this material done slightly better, see: ""Ghost World"", ""Art School Confidential"", ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"", ""Bound for Glory"", ""Mister Lonely"" and ""Exit Through the Gift Shop""."
"MOscarbradley","9","14","27","17 May 2014"," The most imaginative film you're likely to see this year.
","I've said it before and I'm happy to say it again; Lenny Abrahamson is one of world cinema's most prodigious and least known talents. His first two films ""Adam and Paul"" and ""Garage"" are small masterpieces of human interaction and observation. His third film, ""What Richard Did"", while very fine, is less engaging despite being, or perhaps because of being, based on a real incident. His new film ""Frank"" is not based on fact but is, rather, 'inspired' by real people. I'm not quite sure if the events, however, are inspired by real events.<br/><br/>The clue lies in the names. Frank, the lead singer in the band with the unpronounceable name of Soronprfbs, wears a giant, paper-mache head which he never takes off. His character is inspired by that of Chris Sievey who created a similar character whom he called Frank Sidebottom. The film itself is based on an article written by Jon Ronson, who co- wrote the script with Peter Straughan, and Jon is the name of the film's other central character who joins the band as a keyboard player and whose machinations lead to a moment of temporary internet fame and quite a lot of heartbreak. Again, I'm not sure if the 'Jon' in the film and the Jon who wrote it are meant to be exactly the same person but it's telling that Ronson, too, was a member of Sidebottom's band. After what I consider the momentary blip of ""What Richard Did"", ""Frank"" sees Abrahamson return to the same tragic-comic bleakness of his first two films and although Abrahamson doesn't actually write his own material he brings to it something of the sensibility of Samuel Beckett but in images rather than in words. In the hands of anyone else ""Frank"" might just have been another eccentric comedy but Abrahamson makes it much darker. One character commits suicide and all of them are emotionally damaged in some way, even Jon.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized the film's ending as sentimental, as going against what came before but I didn't think it sentimental at all. Rather I found it redemptive and very moving, much more so than the bleak endings of ""Adam and Paul"" and ""Garage"" and like all of Abrahamson's films ""Frank"" is beautifully acted. Domhnall Gleeson is superb as Jon, an innocent abroad who learns to grow up and grown up fast by his close proximity to the damaged souls around him. As the vituperative Clara, another band member, Maggie Gyllenhaal is brazenly unsympathetic yet very real. But ultimately this is Michael Fassbender's movie; as Frank, his face hidden for the most part in his giant head, he's like a child in an adult's body or like some unreal, animated character brought to life but as the film progresses we realize that Frank is very real indeed and is no child but a man with his own set of problems which only he can sort out and this is probably the best thing Fassbender has done to date. As for Abrahamson, until now he hasn't made much of a mark outside his native Ireland but perhaps this brilliant film with its 'name' cast will alter that. It won't be to everyone's taste and is unlikely to appeal to a mass audience but discerning viewers will find much here to savor."
"garethmckittrick","1","15","30","17 February 2015"," Absolutely awful
","Did ANYONE involved in this terrible film actually ever see Frank Sidebottom other than a picture of him? Why is he speaking with an American accent? Why is he portrayed as this enigmatic figure? Why is he not singing awful songs?<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see a biopic about the ACTUAL Frank, whose story is far more interesting.<br/><br/>Also the head was ""too good"" in that it looked well made as opposed to a crappy papier mache mask.<br/><br/>And no little frank?<br/><br/>Maggie Gylenhall is perhaps the least attractive human being alive.<br/><br/>Domnhall Gleeson gives a great performance though."

","At the end of any movie, there are usually a few things to consider. What were the redeeming qualities of the primary actors, what was the point of the show.<br/><br/>In the case of frank, I can't see much of their. Jon is a self-centered ass. Initially it seems that the show might be about a young man chasing his dream with a bunch of oddballs, but it isn't, he's just an ass. Frank is an odd recluse who wears a wooden head (a premise that might be funny if it went anywhere). The other band members are barely-functional psychotics (again, a concept that *could* be interesting, but isn't.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is BORING, and I'm not the typical guns-and-explosions type moviegoer but rather somebody who likes a movie that's intellectually stimulating.<br/><br/>It's not funny.

"berndporr","3","19","42","18 May 2014"," The great story about Frank was ruined by standard middle class angst about new technology
","'Frank' is a great movie about the creative process. It's great at the beginning and end. It is different to other band films like ""Walk the line"" not only because of Frank but also because it won't follow the classical dramatic curves of many other more conventional music films. Frank as a character and his flaws made me guessing what's happening at the end and to characterise Frank as a real person with real problems kept me going to the end.<br/><br/>However the film left a bad aftertaste with me how stupid the 20-something keyboarder was characterised. If I were that age I would see that film as a slap in my face. Just because I tweet and am on YouTube I'm not completely brain dead. I found especially the scenes at SXSW hard to watch. It was unnecessary to create the main character as such an idiot and ultimately he stands for his generation in this film. Also the lesson he learns at the end perpetuates what the establishment wants to hammer home to the youth which brings me to the next paragraph.<br/><br/>In more general terms the films conveys a 70s nostalgia against the YouTube / Facebook generation. In this respect it is just a bit more sophisticated than recent clips on social media (!) that in the old days everything was better because we talked to each other. In this film it was a band recording avantgarde music on analogue tape with loads of retro equipment from the ""good old"" times while the 20 something was posting videos on YouTube, tweeted it to the world -- and this was of course evil. To emphasise the other band members' goodness they had no idea about social media at all and not even noticed that they were filmed. Overall a cheap division to make a point which is as old as the established class: new media is evil and the youth needs to learn to stay away from it."
"axapvov","7","3","4","18 January 2018"," Best Band Film since The Commitments
","Ok, I admit it, I had no idea who Frank Sidebottom was until now. At first this fact kind of made me dislike the film a little bit, since what I thought original really wasn´t, but then it seems the script is based on real experience. In the end, one thing for another, inspiration can arrive from anywhere, it doesn´t really matter if the film borrows or not. It´s not supposed to have anything to do with Sidebottoms and, in any case, it´s not enough for it to be a reasonable criticism and I don´t really care for any of it. <br/><br/>Having that little controversy out of the way, it´s got to be said, Frank does for pseudo-intelectual art pop what The Commitments did for soul or Crossroads did for blues. A mediocre kid gets inside a world he doesn´t understand and the audience probably won´t either. There is no need to explain much. The rhythm section is weird cause they´re weird, it´s not important, Maggie Gyllenhaal´s character is detestable, yes, that´s why she´s known as the crazy b**ch, and Frank wears a fake head just because. It´s all a great depiction of this kind of isolated artists who, talented or not, follow their passion with an obnoxious strictness, who don´t hold back any of their follies and emotional imbalances, who might change their minds every second and still be convinced they´re making absolute sense. These misfits exist, and the films honours all the weirdness without judging it, after all, the main character is craving to belong. Domhnall Gleeson´s stiff acting fits the plot, he´s suposed to be lame. He is in no position to ever understand the importance of creative control or edgy integrity. It might not mean anything, it might not even be there to begin with. He has no clue. All of these are complicated, unpopular matters dealt with simplicity and inteligence. More important than that, I found it hilarious right from the first scene. Frank worryingly asking before the big show ""so they don´t know us and love us?"" had me laughing like Muttley, for real."

","I was almost completely unaware of Frank Sidebottom until I heard he had passed away, thanks to the twitter feeds of certain other British icons that I follow. So I came to this movie with almost no preconceptions. And even those were knocked outta place within the first ten minutes, because the film is set in the present day and Sidebottom found his greatest fame in the eighties.<br/><br/>I think they wisely chose to make the story not so much about Frank himself, but on someone who is influenced by him. You need a normal character's eyes to truly appreciate this world. The cast is uniformly excellent -- they all fit into their roles like snug gloves. And Fassbender is such a chameleon that he can even become a character without a face of his own. <br/><br/>Anyway, it's a brilliant meditation about art and fame and the kinds of people who are drawn to both, and it provokes thought without dragging it out of you. It deserves to be an unknown cult classic, just like Frank himself."

Maggie G was, along with many other stars in this art-house piece of rubbish —quite repulsive. Michael F only showed 'acting' chops after being unmasked, and this tiny display of his formidable skills was exceedingly lame.

"Leofwine_draca","3","6","12","1 September 2016"," What on earth did I just watch?
","I consider myself a fan of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson on the strength of having watched his fine little dramas ADAM AND PAUL and WHAT RICHARD DID. Sadly, FRANK is my third effort from this director and the first one to leave me completely cold. It's a comedy following the trials and tribulations of a low-rent band who are presided over by lead singer Frank, played by Michael Fassbender in a giant head obviously modelled on one-time Northern comedian Frank Sidebottom.<br/><br/>This is a very odd film. Quirky, in fact. I'm all for quirkiness, but somehow it doesn't work here. As a comedy, it's never funny, and as a film it's a complete failure. I found that the viewer was expected to watch a bunch of unlikeable characters parading around, arguing, occasionally having sex, and going through various trials. To be honest, I couldn't give a jot for any of them. Even the music isn't very good.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is the erstwhile lead, a man who acts as the viewer's introduction into a surreal world. As with the other films I've seen him in, he's dreadful; cold and wooden throughout, always concentrating on acting rather than giving a naturalistic performance. His father he isn't. Michael Fassbender is much better, despite being hidden behind the mask; the assured professional, he never disappoints. Sadly, the movie is also saddled with Maggie Gyllenhaal, completely out of place and playing the most hateful character ever. FRANK bored me to tears and I hate the thought of sitting through it again."

","Often, when sitting through screenings that push the limits of my cine-file patience, I wonder if I'm going to accomplish even the most basic of constructive comments. Ironically, with 'Frank', I was so knocked down with absolute glee that I don't know where to begin. Co-screenwriters Jon Ronson & Peter Straughan ('The Men Who Stare at Goats') and director Lenny Abrahamson ('What Richard Did') have constructed a story that is totally effortless in its tone and ability to hit all the right comic keys. The cast is fantastic with Domhnall Gleeson ('About Time' / 'Black Mirror') playing Jon, a small-town wanna-be musician who finds himself in the serendipitous position to fill in as the keyboardist in an art-rock band (think 'Talking Heads' crossed with 'Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds') lead by the eccentric Frank (Michael Fassbender), a troubled man whose psychosis requires that he never take off his massive-eyed, fishbowl mask–often pleading that he 'has a certificate' to prove it. The best description I can give for Fassbender's Frank is of a good-natured Hunter S. Thompson as a child with Asperger's syndrome; it's really quite a performance, especially considering it's done without ever seeing his face. Maggie Gyllenhaal's ('The Dark Knight' / 'Secretary') avant-garde Clara is underplayed and with a deadpan hilarity that never shows the slightest wink or parody. As Jon begins to introduce the prospect of fame and popularity, his already distrusting band mates become skeptical as Frank's stability and creativity begins to unravel. I'm not sure the whole audience got the joke but this by far the most fun I've had with a film this year – SXSW or otherwise."

"pj-bus","4","14","37","14 May 2014"," First, you must put the original Frank out of your head
","I think that to enjoy this film first you must put any memories of Chris Sievey's comic persona Frank Sidebottom out of your head! This Frank persona has similarities to Chris Sievey's but there is nothing common about the story of this character.<br/><br/>Overall this is reasonably enjoyable film. It is the story of a fictional alternative rock group fronted by Frank. If you have followed alternative rock groups you might recognise bits of the story. I saw some similarities with the story of Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band.<br/><br/>There are a good number of humorous moments and ideas but the film never becomes more than being entertainment. There are no real surprises about the main character and it is not a study of a real problem, Chris Sievey was not a man unable to ever remove his false head, for example, so that problem as described in the film is not real. There is nothing particularly imaginative about the treatment of that issue. However there is a lot of fun about Frank's always wearing of that head and what that is like for the people around him.<br/><br/>The film is set in the present day however Frank and his group live in an earlier period in their minds. They have no knowledge of Facebook and mobile devices seem a mystery to them. The whole feel of the group is 70s. Their creation of music made me think of Henry Cow but it didn't sound like that. The group are set against the modern world to a degree. They record their music onto a big open reel tape recorder, one of them plays a theremin. They spend a substantial part of the film in a retreat in rural Ireland. All of this reinforces that the group is a mini-cult, shut off from the bigger world.<br/><br/>There is one mildly clever revelation in the film about the dynamic between the characters.<br/><br/>All the acting is very good, direction, camera work and editing are also really good. It contains many clever ideas.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that it is just less than the sum of its parts."
"rob1n","6","3","5","26 December 2014"," What could have been
","I enjoyed the film for what it was, but I went to college in Manchester at the time when Frank was first a celebrity on the local scene. Sadly all of that was lost, where was Little Frank, the appearances on the telly, not one mention of Timperley, He was English, he was a Northern lad, he was as Manc as you can get, how the hell did this end up in America?<br/><br/>Now this has been made, and I hope it made some money, could that be reinvested to make a proper film about Frank, set in the right place, that reflects the reality of his life.<br/><br/>As I said I enjoyed the film and if I had no memories of Frank from my younger days then it wouldn't matter, but I do have those memories so it matters. Next thing will be a film about Tony Wilson and it will be all set in LA or New York, or a film about the creation of the Northern Football Union set in a pub in Wales instead of Huddersfield. I dislike revisionism like this where to gain an audience the truth and facts can do one."
"jan_kalina","8","5","11","25 September 2014"," ""You play C, F and G?""
","If that is all I need to know to be in a band then I can basically be a one man band. Frank shows how weird artists can be but I guess it is a requirement for an artist to be a little weird. The fans and the audience demands it, you have to differ yourself somehow.<br/><br/>Despite the title Franks isn't about the titular character as it is about Jon's journey. Jon played by Domhnall Gleeson is an aspiring struggling musician who stumbles upon a opportunity to play with the band ""Soronprfbs"" led by Frank. They invite him along and Jon thinking it is just a weekend gig later finds out that they are making a new album. Jon tries to find his place in the band and he also shoots videos, posts pictures and writes about the band online thus creating a viral campaign for the band.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is turning out to be a very sympathetic and promising actor especially after last year's About Time. The film stands on his likable persona and if anyone else would be cast but him the film wouldn't be so enjoyable. Recently I always find myself to be watching a film with Scoot McNairy, who is turning out to be one of my favorite actors. I just never he is in some film and then he pops up and he is just delightful. Really hope this guy will be getting more and more roles. Michael Fassbender delivers a great performance even though we only hear his voice for most of the time. But even with theses limits he has he still can create a compelling and fully fleshed out character. The only problem in the film isn't the pacing or the script or the quirky humor it is Maggie Gyllenhaal. In my opinion she is one of the worst actresses in the world and mostly I find it very hard to look at thus making her character extremely irritating.<br/><br/>Jon finds out that you don't need to have an abusive childhood or mental illness to be a great artist - musician in this case. You just need to write songs from your heart and live. Not try to be somebody who you are not. You need to be creative plus a little talent doesn't hurt."
"WriteOnEjaleighBlog","7","2","3","3 November 2018"," Frank But Not As We Know Him
","Frank is a 2014 film directed by Lenny Abrahamson, produced by David Barron, Ed Guiney and Stevie Lee and written by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. Starring Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scoot McNairy, and François Civil. Frank is a story told through the eyes of Jon, a young keyboard player, portrayed by the affable Domhnall Gleeson, who becomes immersed in the world of a papier-mâché-headed musician Frank - Michael Fassbender - and a supporting cast of equally weird band members: Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays Clara, the quirky and highly temperamental Theremin player, as well as Don, Baraque and Nana. The film is very loosely based on Jon Ronson's own experience of playing keyboard in Frank Sidebottom's Cor Blimey Big Band. I say loosely based; I expected this film to be a biography of Sidebottom. I should have known better. For these that are uninitiated, he was the creation of former one-hit wonder, Chris Sievey (1955-2010), an aspiring pop star who had enjoyed brief success in the 70s as part of the band The Freshies and their catchy hit 'I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk'. In essence, 'Frank' was a quasi-cartoon character with a giant papier mâché head, who was still living with his Mum and staying with his Auntie at the seaside in Blackpool at the age of thirty-five. A larger than life creation, half-tormented and half-supported by cardboard characters, Frank would sing cover versions of songs on a plinkety-plonk Bontempi keyboard. The main lyrics would always be changed to accommodate his home town of Timperley, such as Bruce Springsteen's Born in Timperley; the Kinks's Timperley Sunset and Eddie Cochran's Timperley Blues. Frank's use of song lyrics was one of a kind. Only he could think of rhyming visa with pepperoni pizza and lama with Bananarama. Act I of Frank follows the band to an isolated cabin in Ireland as they prepare to record their debut album. Spurred on by a tiny whiff of success, they are then invited to a music festival to perform in Austin, Texas. The plot appears simplistic, in that the central character goes on a journey of discovery over who Frank is, but the themes explored in the film are anything but. Jon the character and Jon Ronson are both obsessed with the change which occurs when Frank puts the head on and assumes the character of 'Frank'. For much of the film we only see Frank with his head on. This leads to some great comic moments such as seeing Frank shower with a plastic bag on his head, Frank describing his facial expressions out loud and Frank boxing and being interviewed at the South by Southwest Music Festival. Chris Sievey was ahead of his time. He predated the ethics of Punk by starting his own label in 1974 and he produced the first ever multi-media single in 1983 by incorporating a ZX Spectrum game. We see this in the film, when he devises his own system of music notation and pushes the boundaries over what can be used as an instrument.
The one anecdote in the film, which does have a grain of truth, is how Ronson ended up playing in Frank's band. Sidebottom was booked to play at London Poly and his usual keyboard player was indisposed. He asked Ronson, the ENTS officer, if he knew how to play the chords, C, D, E, to which Ronson replied that yes, he did. So began his long and somewhat surreal stint in Frank's band. I met Jon Ronson many times in the late eighties when my mate used to stalk his band, The Man from Del Monte. A gentle soul with a kind of ethereal quality about him, he always struck me as being one of life's great thinkers, something that is evident throughout the film. The idea had come from his frustration that the genius behind Frank Sidebottom seemed to delight in producing childlike nonsense. Whenever the chance came along for real fame and exposure, Chris Sievey would self-destruct. One such example is when Frank was asked to support the band Bros in 1989 and ended up being booed off stage as no one understood the irony of his music. Ronson remained mystified by this and wanted to write a film based on the premise that there are some people who are just too 'fantastically strange' to make it in the mainstream. He wanted to touch upon elements from other performers such as Captain Beefheart and Daniel Johnston. Ronson must have known that a straight-forward biopic would have run the risk that the audience simply would not 'get' Frank Sidebottom and his childlike simplicity. This was the reason that Frank's television career bombed, as for some inexplicable reason, his humour did not translate to the small screen. Furthermore, Ronson felt aggrieved that Frank had nurtured so much genuine talent of artists such as Mark Radcliffe, Chris Evans and Caroline Aherne. These people had risen to the stratospheres of success, whilst Frank Sidebottom remained very much rooted in the mediocre; doing small gigs and pub pop quizzes. This film proved more of a chance for Ronson to vocalise his frustrations out loud rather than a straight forward biopic. He had discussed the idea with Chris Sievey prior to his premature death in 2010 and received his blessing. I spent a considerable time during my student days, following Frank Sidebottom around the Northern circuit. I was one of the few, who met him once without his head on, when he was Chris Sievey. ""You're Frank Sidebottom"" I teased him, ""I can tell it's you by the voice and the mannerisms."" ""Frank Sidebottom?"" He questioned. ""Who's he? I know nothing about a Frank Sidebottom. I'm Chris. I'm just here with my mates."" He then proceeded to delight in playing this charade for a good twenty minutes, blurring the lines of reality, that Frank was a real person. His parting shot to me had been to tell me to try and stand at the front of the hall by the stage. It was one of the best nights of my life, as Frank sang Fireball XL5 to me. My mate and I also once bumped into him in a chip shop on the Wirral before a gig, when he was Frank Sidebottom. He'd gone in the chippy to buy some chips, still with the head on and stood chatting away to us as though it was the most normal thing in the world to wear a giant head - and attempt to eat a bag of chips! It was the pretence that Chris loved most about being Frank and it is this element that Ronson brings in repeatedly throughout the film. The insightful, first-person voiceover allows the
audience to wonder with Jon, 'What goes on inside that head...?' Similarly, one starts to contemplate if Frank is different without his head and what has prompted him to mask his true persona? Perhaps it is only in wearing a mask that one can truly express oneself: thus, in deception lies the truth? For Chris Sievey, it was all part of the game of being Frank Sidebottom and the comedy of maintaining the charade. Yet in the film, these questions are only answered in the light of mental illness and such details are presented as irrelevant to the fact that these characters are also outsiders to society. That is what makes a true genius: being an outsider and dealing with the underlying difficulties this presents. To me, this film is more Jon Ronson than Frank Sidebottom. It is Jon Ronson's gift to Chris Sievey. Frank's view of life was childlike. Much of that is lost in the film because its need to incorporate elements of mental health issues. I wanted more of the simplicity, of humour that Frank encapsulated; the jokes about Queen's Freddie Mer-curie, the ending of every song with, 'You know it is, it really is."", his wicked put-downs to his puppet nemesis Little Frank, the puns on language and the obsession with being in 'showbusiness' but it just wasn't there. At times the film appeared far too serious to be linked to Frank Sidebottom. I almost wanted the real Frank to enter the stage and declare in one of his well-used catch-phrases, ""Can't we have a few laughs? Have a bit of light-heartedness."" Therefore, when judged from the point of view of a Frank Sidebottom fan, sadly, it doesn't work. Yet, judging from the point of view of a film lover, it is a gentle and at times poignant and thoughtful movie. It could have become quite farcical or slapstick, but the director, Lenny Abrahamson is experienced in blending comedy and pathos and turns the film more into a modern fairy-tale or fable, in a way that recalls Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, and even to an extent in its treatment of outsiders, Truffaut's Antoinelle Doinel films or Guillermo del Toro's, The Shape of Water. I didn't come out of seeing this movie laughing out loud in the way that I used to laugh during and after a Frank Sidebottom gig. I came out feeling moved by the story and understanding more the reasons why Chris Sievey never gained the acclaim that he richly deserved in his all too brief a lifetime. If this film makes more people discover the unadulterated joy that was Frank Sidebottom's comedy then so much the better. A documentary, 'Being Frank - the Chris Sievey Story' has recently been shown at the BFI London Film Festival and a Manchester premier is scheduled for next year. These two films should be shown side by side as a tribute to Frank Sidebottom because they enable us to understand the man and his creation more and as Frank himself would have concluded, ""You know they do. They really do."

","Frank is a quirky, thrilling, and extremely entertaining film about an underground musician with a huge fake head and his band's mission of making an album, which is led astray by a newcomer. With its incredible soundtrack and stellar performances from Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, and others, it's truly worth watching.<br/><br/>Lenny Abrahamson does a great job of blending the music the bands play into the soundtrack for the whole film. This blending of diagetic and nondiagetic sound gives the film a charming quality and leads you to be more engrossed in it. Not only the band's music, but the dynamic of the band itself is gripping the whole way through. Although it's hard to pick a favorite, Fassbender's performance as Frank is concrete and strange in the best way. Pair this with the insecure qualities of Domhnall Gleeson as Jon and you have a great dynamic of friendliness, frustration, and even manipulation. After many watches, this movie remains truly impressive and worth watching more.<br/><br/>With that said, some of the second half of the movie doesn't end up being as surreal and entertaining as the rest. Maybe it's a needed rest in the time line of the movie, but after each watch, this segment just doesn't remain as attention grabbing as the rest. That's only a minor gripe though, as I personally am a huge fan of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, with a great story, acting, soundtrack, and more, Frank is a unique and excellent movie that I would recommend anybody to watch."

","'Frank (2014)' is never quite what you expect, telling its tale of misfit rockstars with just the right amount quirkiness. It's funny but it also has a really serious edge to it, dealing with difficult themes throughout. It does some interesting things with its protagonist, which I won't spoil, and is constantly engaging. Its messages are wonderfully nuanced and, in a way, antithetical to the sort of stuff the genre tends to peddle. It's an odd film, for sure, but it's entertaining and has something important to say. 7/10"

","Jon wants to be a musician; there's only one problem: he sucks at it.
Frank is a musical genius; capable of coming up with a great song in a matter of seconds. He also suffers from a mental illness and always wears a giant paper mache head.<br/><br/>Jon really wants to be like him.<br/><br/>As someome with practically no musical talent, I completely relate with Jon's frustation and feelings towards Frank. Like a mix of jealousy and admiration.<br/><br/>I love how this film explores this feeling I often get, that because I didn't have a tragic past, I somehow don't deserve to be succesful. Like I haven't earned it.<br/><br/>Initially, Jon would love to have a tragic past or a mental illness, because that way he feels he will finally succeed as an artist, like Frank.
But as it's so heartbreakingly revealed to him, Frank's condition isn't some cool quirk that made him talented, but a real illness that must be taken seriously, which is something he never did.<br/><br/>This movie is a truly underrated gem and features one of Michael Fassbender's best performances, and you almost never see his face.<br/><br/>The final scene, when they sing ""I Love You All"" is pure perfection and it always makes me feel like crying."

"leonblackwood","5","3","7","21 September 2014"," Strange and off the wall! 5/10
","Review: I must admit, I was expecting this movie to be more of a comedy than a drama. After seeing the crazy head on Michael Fassbender, I was expecting a movie more about everyone accepting the fact that he didn't want to take the head off, but the movie is the complete opposite. His friends look as Frank as a hero more than a man with a massive head, so the whole comedic aspect has been taken out of the film from the beginning. The film is more about the band creating this album and the growth of John who is seeking inspiration to write songs. Personally I think that the director missed the opportunity to make a classic comedy. Don't get me wrong, there are some funny scenes and the script was well written, but it could have been much better. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Michael Fassbender was a weird choice for this movie because he's not really known for comedic roles. He's showed off his action skills in X-Men and Haywire and he was great in 12 Years A Slave and Prometheus so it's good to see him try a low budget film which is completely off the wall. I liked Maggie Gyllenhaal's character who was wacky and strange but her singing was awful. Anyway, I did stick with the film because I was wondering what direction the storyline was going to take, but I was expecting better.<br/><br/>Budget: $1million Worldwide Gross: $1.2million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there comedy/drama about a band trying to make an album in the middle of nowhere, with a lead singer who won't take off an extremely large head. 5/10"
"Quinoa1984","10","4","11","8 November 2014"," Love and insanity in rock and roll
","If Hal Ashby were alive today, he would probably make a film like Frank. Lenny Abrahamson's latest feature (from a script from in part Jon Ronson) has Ashby's sense of eccentricity but a contentment with that. The characters here are all alive, even the ones who don't have a lot of lines (the ones who speak French, yes them too). It's a story about creativity and process, and how it can tear a person apart or make someone who doesn't have it down yet that much hungrier to achieve it.<br/><br/>It is extremely funny through its off-beat dialog, how a line will come out from where you completely least expect it, and yet it's got a core that is very serious. Frank deals with mental illness in a way that is both delicate but subtle; we know a good many in this band are crazy, some maybe just more clinically so than others. But the director and writers never go to mocking them, at least with any cruelty. It's completely sincere, and so, hopefully, most of us buy it too.<br/><br/>Frank is a rock and roll movie, but I've rarely seen one as funny as this. And it's disarming in its humor, its asides, and the dark edges that wrap around so much of the storyline and characters. I have to think without a character like John this movie would still be watchbable, but a bit more impenetrable. John gets into the weirdness of this avant-garde group, the kind that records sounds of the wind and water being poured for their album, and experiment for a full year, fourteen hours a day. We feel the weirdness right along with him.<br/><br/>For how unusual Frank looks, a great amount of the power of Fassbender's performance is that we don't see him for 99% of the film. Fassbender's voice is enough, and he uses it as well as his body to convey so much. He makes a fully realized character and a soulful, uproarious deadpan satire of rock stars - but without the face, which is quite hard to do; in a sense though he's playing a rock-n-roll Darth Vader (maybe crossed with Jim Morrison if he'd gone through five different alternative scenes). But despite Frank's trajectory is that of someone with mental illness, there's not too much of a feeling of cringing when he does some oddball choices (for example, for a friend's ashes, he instead tosses out into the wind flour), and the writing hatches on to these folks being true to themselves.<br/><br/>So, by the time the group makes its album, and heads by luck to SxSW to play a gig, they're not so unusual anymore. The movie emphasizes this band as family, and it's here that the movie has yet another level, about the dysfunctional brothers and sisters (are there even any parents? maybe Frank and Clara, but it could go either way), and John as the adopted child or pet who tries to get in with his music, which falls up short more often than not - at least in the midst of the eclectic and strange. So yet another thing, about who's got it and who doesn't in art; this is a sort of topic that is not new to movies, to be sure (hey, Amadeus for one). But here, it gets a fresh take thanks to the characters being likable and unlikable in equal measure. We don't know what could come next for John or Frank or anyone really.<br/><br/>And the music itself... it's actually pretty cool. Or maybe it's terrible, but it's a cool-terrible, if that makes sense. Of course, if you don't have any sort of open ear for experimental stuff - whether this goes past like Radiohead or Pink Floyd for you I don't know - it might seem like a big laugh at experimental music's expense. And yet it's all so original and of its own (the actors playing the music and Fassbender singing with everything he's got live by the way) it's hard to see it being mockable except in almost an intellectual way. I remember before seeing the film the band performed on the Colbert Report, and the initial shock of seeing these actors playing and singing with this giant head included faded in like ten seconds. It's real music, as bizarre and left field it is.<br/><br/>A slight downside is that, maybe just at first but here and there, Gleeson is a little one note. Or, maybe that's the character himself, harping on the same beat of 'I want to make good music, here's a song!' Where he goes and how he takes charge and deals with the conflict of this group, while things go from weird to shocking to sad to weird and off-putting and delirious and sad again, makes so much of the film engaging and different and with integrity. And the ending is simply extraordinary. So much leads these characters, through ups and downs, to a point where they're just on a stage (in part) and find the song a certain way.<br/><br/>I love when stories go on such a real but absurdist journey, and there's no lack of humor in the face of a dramatic story that has characters facing personal odds and ends, and can find a place that feels true and heart-breaking in a way. We don't know what will happen to the Soronfbs from here, but they don't lack artistry. Finding a movie that can handle that really well and true is rare."

"estebangonzalez10","6","2","4","17 January 2015"," An odd study of the relationship between artistic creativity and mental illness
","""I love your wall. Put your arms around me. Fiddly digits, itchy britches. I love you all.""<br/><br/>Lenny Abrahamsson directs this offbeat tragicomedy inspired by comedian Chris Sievey's comedy character Frank Sidebottom. I had never heard of him, but this film isn't actually a biopic because it only takes that concept of the character and applies it to a musician who always wears a mask around his head. It is a film that very subtly has a lot to say about the relationship between artistic creativity and mental illness among many other things. Frank is a film that I respect more than I actually enjoy considering I found the pacing a bit tedious at times and wasn't engaged with the characters. I didn't actually enjoy the music either, but of course it isn't meant to be entertaining, but it would probably have a little fan base considering their creative approach towards music. I also found it way more clever than funny. I didn't find myself laughing as much as I had hoped for. Frank is actually a short film running under 90 minutes and for about the first hour I wasn't really into it, but the last 30 minutes did draw me in and by the end I even enjoyed Frank's last song. From the moment the band travels to the SXSW concert I finally began to engage with some of the characters. The film is offbeat and weird at times sort of like its central characters and it reminds us that there is a very thin line between artistic creativeness and madness. Most of the film takes place in a cabin in Ireland where the band is recording their next album over the course of an year. You get the sense that what they are doing isn't just searching for inspiration. They actually are like of a support group in a way considering they are all mentally unstable (with the exception of Gleeson's character who plays like the fish out of the water here). Frank is a very odd film, but creative nonetheless with some touching moments near the end.<br/><br/>It's impossible not to talk about Michael Fassbender when reviewing this film. I truly believe he is one of the best actors living today, but having him wear a gigantic papier-mâché head covering his entire face could seriously restrain his performance. It didn't because it is Fassbender who we are talking about and he can pull anything off. So without his facial expressions he was forced to use his voice and body language which he did perfectly. His posture and the way he uses his hands convey a lot of meaning. Even his voice was restrained by this gigantic head so he really did basically do it all with his body language. If there was anything that got me trough this film during the first hour it was his performance. The lead character of the film however is Jon Burroughs (played by Domhnall Gleeson) who runs into the eccentric band members at the right time and is offered a chance to play the keyboards for them. Jon has always wanted to write songs, but he doesn't quite fit into this group of misfits. He is more interested in becoming famous than actually being creative and in a way begins to influence Frank and trying to make him sell out. The rest of the band members are played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is perhaps the oddest character of them all), Francois Civil, and Carla Azar. Scoot McNairy is sort of the manager of the band. Jon discovers early in the film that these are all troubled people and so he begins to develop a theory that artistic creativity comes from living traumatic experiences. So considering he has never been able to write a decent song, he believes it is necessary to go through some sort of trauma with the rest of the members in order to find his creative genius. With Frank however that concept is turned upside down and it reminds us that art isn't a product of traumatic events. It is a way of healing and coping with them through music. The film can be absurd and strange at times but it does convey the message in a very subtle way which makes the ending all that much better."

I feel like I gained nothing from this movie. I did not laugh, I did not have my heart flutter, I did not get attached to any characters. There was nothing here for me but I guess someone who relates to the pain that comes with mental illness or someone with very different taste could enjoy this movie.

","Going into this the only knowledge I had was the small bit that Chris Stuckman talks about this movie. Which was basically nothing, I write my own music. Seeing this film motivated me to both want to go and try to record and make like 50 songs in an hour, but also to completely throw away my instruments and never play again. The movie's main character is Jon, a musician who is struggling to find his sound. He joins a band with an enigmatic main singer called Frank. Frank wears a head and never takes it off. The movie follows the bands progression, but it's more then just a band story. It also discusses what makes music enjoyable, and the creative vision artists have. This is definitely going to be on my fun quirky movies list. This one is unique, and I can see people being divided on it, the characters are all quirky and weird with the exception of Jon. Overall a fun 7.5/10. If you wanna watch this one you have to be in the right headspace for it. Be open to new ideas and let the movie guide you, the movie never drags, I rarely say that about a movie but it doesn't. Franks strange habits and seeing Jon adapt to them keep you entertained and interested the whole way through, and without spoiling it the ending and answer to who is behind the head is satisfying."

"charlielpd","6","0","0","28 November 2018"," Not lacking in originality, but a difficult ride if you don't care for the characters
","Frank is a film that is misleading in two ways - firstly, despite reprising the head, the titular character is not an attempt at the existing Frank Sidebottom character. Secondly, it is often presented as a comedy, which is true in some ways but ultimately the film is more a sort of dark comedy/satire that largely veers into drama territory and away from jokes.
That said, the film documents a young keyboardist who is drafted into a band led by the titular Frank. The band is avant-garde and difficult with Frank as a sort of underappreciated genius who inspires devotion from his band - a devotion which allows him to push them to their outer limits both artistically and personally. The young keyboardist desires to push things in a more radio-friendly direction and this creates tension with the existing band members who tend to see Frank's art as sacred.
Without giving away too much of the plot, the film explores the tension between these two impulses and the members of the band who support either one - and how a sudden rise in popularity pushes that tension to a boiling point.
All of this has the makings of a great film, but there is little to grasp onto. The music is alright but hardly the avant-garde masterwork it would need to be to make the discussion of Frank's genius make sense. The general underlying thought of the film seems to be that everyone's interest in Frank is primarily for their own greedy reasons - that the mask (literally and figuratively) and not the man behind it is what drives their interest. This would befit a character who had an eccentric but undeniably masterful body of work - word-of-mouth cult figures like Daniel Johnston, R. Stevie Moore, and Gary Wilson come to mind - but the music itself is unfortunately somewhat forgettable and this undermines Frank's own outsider art appeal. The characters are largely quite greedy and self-involved in keeping with that theme, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think the film keeps the requisite distance from the characters to make it work, and so you are left with the sense that it wants you to both identify with and dislike everyone. The effect, for me, was exhausting - but I can understand the appeal for many.
The film is certainly well shot and well acted, and it is deserving of recognition for its unique concept, but it left me and my friends somewhat cold and empty afterwards. If you're looking for a straightforward comedy about being in a band, like this was marketed as, you'd best go for the Swedish film ""We Are The Best"" which has a more empathetic approach to its characters that contrasts with its darker undercurrents. If you want to explore a unique take on the phenomenon of the outsider artist and the struggle over artistic license, and don't mind a massive dose of cynicism in the process, then you may strongly connect with Frank in a way that I couldn't."

","Like Frank's band's music, not everyone is going to love this film, but it is a very good one. Well acted, well crafted, its only issue is the subject, which is both very weird and sensitive, funny and terribly tragic. It's a road trip movie, in its essence: the normal guy gets swept by the charisma and magic of a band and he joins them, body and soul. Yet the ending is not happy, nor extremely sad, it's just... what did you expect it was going to happen? It also feels like a play, with basically four actors and some stand ins. They are all great in their performances, if you dig the story. It all stands on that one point: will you understand the story and the feelings of the characters?<br/><br/> Bottom line: if you like it, you will probably love it. You might not like it."

All that matters is how these mentally issued people, while miserable by themselves, make themselves happy, and in my opinion part of the movie represents that. The most important thing in life isn't what others think of you, but its sticking to what makes you feel complete. Who cares what the world thinks about them? Even if they are taken as a huge joke they will still have something that most people don't; people who they can understand, and be understood by."

Of course he is not alone in the movie, the mix of characters its just perfect, from the almost silent background guitar and drummer players (Francois Civil and Carla Azar respectively), the annoying and crazy Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the nice but just a wee-bit-troubled Don (Scoot McNairy), to the nerdy/ambitious wannabe-a-rock star played by Gleeson, and of course Frank, we got it all. A psychotic but fun bunch of people, different of everything you commonly see, it's the most attractive aspect of the film. Even though the lead actor here is Domnhall, Fassbender performance steals the show, and this is the main factor for this movie. A showing of what ambition could do, to an original thing, something that could wreck everything that you're and purely want. A crazy/dramatic/musical/comedic film, that you must see.

","Frank is a relatively unknown and limited released independent film. Starring Domhnall Gleeson (as Jon), an untalented rock-star wannabe, gets a lucky break when, on an English beach, he meets Don (Scoot McNairy), who manages an art-rock band. Furthermore very quickly, Don hires Jon to replace the group's suicidal keyboardist. A gig in Ireland and an album-recording project in a lakeside cabin are on tap.<br/><br/>The band is led by Frank (Michael Fassbender wearing a large paper- mache type head mask), whose music reflects mental illness as well as talent and who never takes off his above-mentioned mask. Frank shows kindness and support to Jon, while the other band members tend to dislike him. Also followed by, hostile is theremin player Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who maintains a strong protective (and romantic) interest in Frank. Jon is clueless to Frank's fragility. He also doesn't understand the band's disinterest in commercial success.<br/><br/>This film is quite well written and acted well, which is why it is an entertaining watch. Michael Fassbender played as Frank is easily the star and most likable and watchable on screen in this film. The audience is eager to watch whatever he does, and the main reason is with him wearing the mask over his head. The comedy in the film isn't laugh out loud which works here as it is not forced, and more subtle. <br/><br/>Frank is relatively short in running time, where they perhaps could have added about 10-15 more minutes, but otherwise the film is quite interesting and unique as it is entertaining."

","Untalented as a songwriter but nevertheless set on making it as a musician, a young Irishman quits his day job to join an eccentric band whose lead singer dons a papier-mâché mask that he never removes in this offbeat drama. Domhnall Gleeson is fine as the milquetoast young protagonist who becomes more and more of an authoritative voice in the band and Michael Fassbender has some solid moments in a mostly voice-only performance as the singer; his observation about normal human faces being a little strange themselves certainly resonates. The talents of the two leads are, however, hardly maximised here. Stories about the rise and falls of bands are a dime a dozen and 'Frank' does little to distinguish itself other than the mask, which soon becomes more of an annoying gimmick than delightful quirk as it distracts from Gleeson's character growth. The music is hardly great either, though the film's weakest area is its supporting characters; it is hard to feel for the band's highs and lows when we only get to know two of them in depth. Then there is the love-hate relationship between Gleeson and Maggie Gyllenhaal which never rings true. Having Gleeson constant tweet about his experiences with his tweets appearing over the action is a further jarring touch that subtracts from the immediacy of the action. Director Lenny Abrahamson would of course later go on to score an Oscar nomination for directing 'Room'. This earlier effort is a strikingly different sort of motion picture at least and may be of interest to those retrospectively exploring his filmmaking origins."

It's odd characters and dialogue create a mystical quirky feel to it that had me thinking about . Lots of the funny parts are done in the classic dry British humor, mixed with sarcasm. It also had parts that were just childish and fun, and brought out the humour of the entire situation in the plot. <br/><br/>Although it plays around with satire and nihilism, it also features some dark moments and messages about suicide and depression, in a very realistic manner.<br/><br/>I'd say the movie only falls short in plot progression as it slows towards one part, but otherwise the acting, cinematography, score, and writing are all top notch."

","Frank follows an aspiring musician who gets recruited by a band led by an eccentric lead singer who wears a paper mache head. <br/><br/>For starters this is a very unique movie, much more so than I expected. It seems like everyone is just a little insane, and it gives the movie a cartoonish, somewhat over-the-top vibe that I really enjoyed seeing. And yet it was still realistic. The characters are relatable in some ways, and most all of them are a lot of fun to watch. <br/><br/>The way the movie decides to use comedy is always very natural. It never goes out of it's way to make jokes, but rather uses a lot of comedic imagery as it comes. It uses Frank's paper mache head in this way often, and thus it never feels out of place because this guy wears the head everywhere. It knows what it is and uses that fact to it's advantage. And when it isn't imagery, it's from the characters and it still works incredibly well. <br/><br/>Probably the best aspect of the movie is the characters. Yes, they're a lot of fun, but there is plenty of emotional investment in them too. Despite their instabilities, I completely fell in love with them. Most of them seem to go deeper than what the audience sees, save for maybe two of them, whom I often forgot about. Regardless, they weren't unlikable characters so it was mostly forgivable. <br/><br/>The music is actually pretty good. It all sounds very unique, and it does a great job of selling the motives of the main characters to create different music, or sometimes even use psychology to make great music. Furthermore, the soundtrack is great for the movie, as everything is already so weird that normal music just wouldn't work. <br/><br/>Overall Frank is great. The characters, the acting, the comedy, the music, everything is great. It's a blast to watch and I can't wait to see it again. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."

","Last time a movie kept me awake at night was The Ring. Horror movies can do that but can a comedy film do that to you? Frank did, for completely different reasons. I could not bring myself to write a review for about a month. Kept telling myself, it's not going to be easy. Its not hard to tell you the story but to describe the incredibly layered symbolism is tricky. If I tell you that its about a bunch of post-industrial experimental rock musicians making music in a cabin in the woods then you might think its just another indie hipster band docudrama. Then you should know that Michael Fassbender plays the lead singer of the band who wears a fake head all the time. Sounds quirky right? Now why would an A list star take a role in a movie that doesn't let him show his face for the entirety of the film? Because Fassbender can act with his body. Now you might think that's really not helpful but you really need to watch the movie to experience what I'm talking about. It's insane! Did I tell you about Maggie Gyllenhaal's theremin playing role in this movie? She can pull off those nutty characters so well. <br/><br/>Talking of insanity, Frank is an inner journey to discover whether madness is elemental to creativity. Can true art be produced without going crazy? Or is it that all artistic geniuses are born with mental issues? The answer is not very encouraging for the emotionally balanced ""intellectuals"" who try to measure art through popular conventions. Frank shows a remarkable insight into creative minds and the eccentricity that is sometimes uncontrollable. Why do die-hard fans lose interest in a band when they get too commercial? Because they can't find the insanity and heart in the music anymore. There is only so much creativity you can tap in once you turn your art into a factory produced product. <br/><br/>Frank hit me in the place where it hurts the most. My own failed music career. None of my band members were ever so insane and naturally gifted. Makes me wonder if this what it takes to make really good music? It completely disarms you. If you are a struggling musician then probably don't watch this movie because you might throw your guitar or piano or drum kit in the river the next day. As for me, I'm already retired. I just had to watch Our Idiot Brother to shake off my mood. But Frank made me laugh too. There were some familiar moments and I felt at home with the characters. They were all so flawed and unhinged. Like some modern spiritual successors of 'I am the Walrus'. Frank also made me cry because it brought back some memories. People cried when Led Zeppelin reunited for one last time also when Nirvana played at their Hall of Fame induction. These are happy moments but they are also emotional ones. Reunions always are."

","Frank is so much more than a stark psychotic drama. It is a heightened dig into the heads of brilliant characters you might have trouble getting a proper read on. It is loosely inspired on the life of Frank Sidebottom (Chris Sievey) and has been curdled fictitiously into a gorgeous account.<br/><br/>OUTSTANDING FRANK CHARACTERS To see everything through the sane eyes of the protagonist Jon Burroughs played superbly by Domhnall Gleeson was a delight per se. His character would shoehorn you into his shoes to help you get a better insight into the story. You soon get an endearing perspective on a peculiar persona who prefers to stay behind a mask, come what may.<br/><br/>Clara played by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scoot McNairy's Don are uncanny characters as well, aced by both the actors to perfection. Visual landscapes captured in the movie are magnificent, so is understanding the madness in every little thing. Lenny Abrahamson's direction is simply mind-boggling that ices the work of Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan beautifully.<br/><br/>ITCHY BRITCHES SPOILERS AHEAD Michael Fassbender, the guy behind the papier mache cover, is the very definition of queer but he is simply fascinating when you get to know him better. He is the hidden force that keeps everyone together. You can get an idea about the gravity in his character with his lyrics primarily because for the most part you can't really see the expressions he hides underneath the veil.<br/><br/>Things don't stop tumbling towards the bizarre vale yet, as you get to know all the band members gradually, with the aid of Jon's interaction with them. The movie is laced out with their insanity and their extreme love for music. Frank is the crux of the tale as the world Jon writes down is brimming up with love for him in every way. He is a very interesting character but unfortunately like most members of his band is suffering from a mental illness that Jon ploughs out slowly.<br/><br/>What was sad to find out was the world didn't really share Jon's enthusiasm, rather liked the hilarity of the group. He realizes eventually that he was trying to mould something irreparable, and then tries to make amends.<br/><br/>WHAT CONSTANTLY WORKS FOR FRANK What works for this movie is its light humour and its surreal oddity, a misplaced feel of melodrama that weaves it into a majestic outcome. An intelligently built movie that ends with Jon setting things right again, the way things were in the first place, bizarre yet tied down by a single tinge of togetherness.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com"

","I didn't expect much from Frank other than from what I heard was a stellar performance from Michael Fassbender but boy was I in for a surprise. Frank is easily one of my most top 20 films of all time and I really do love this film. Almost all of the characters are great and complex from Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Don (Scoot McNairy), and of course none other than Frank (Michael Fassbender). These characters are all superb and the only 2 people I really had trouble with were the other 2 band members other than whatever his name was having a french accent he was forgettable and so was the woman who played the drums. Frank was a different movie and often took turns and was quite fun in the sense that it was truly unpredictable something that is almost impossible to find in modern day films, the film provided interesting characters and music. Now I must say the music in Frank is an acquired taste but it's unpredictable and in that way I think it mirrors the film. I'm not quite sure if Frank is on Blu-ray seeing as that I watched it on Netflix but if it is pick it up this movie is superb in almost every way and is truly different from anything else out there today."

","Frank is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is, at its core, a drama film but it has some hilarious eye wetting moments. If only it could have kept that mood through out the film. Towards the end it gets too dramatic and sad and it's way too severe a shift from the previous mood.<br/><br/>The only other thing I could say against it is that in the beginning it tries to create a mystery about what Frank's face really looks like. Now that could be interesting, but he is played by Michael Fassbender so I already know what he looks like. So all that seemed pointless.<br/><br/>But despite that and the problems of unevenness Frank is still a solidly good film. It's weird and crazy, it explores human creativity. The actors do a good job in creating a bunch of quirky characters that you love to watch while exploring their near surreal world.<br/><br/>Overall Frank is a very watchable movie even if it somewhat loses its way towards the end."

","But not only was Frank hilarious, it was really poignant and it's art house style didn't detract from what was actually a great storyline. Reminiscent of Submarine or The Double in both editing style and narrative, the characters, though odd, are really likable and amusing. It kept me laughing all the way through, and the conclusion was really heartfelt. It was a great film with awesome narrative structure and a clear message, even if that message was not necessarily what the audience wanted.

","I went into this movie expecting to see a film about a band, and ended up seeing a movie about mental illness. Domhnall Gleeson (""About Time"", ""Unbroken"") stars as a Brit who joins an American rock band touring in England, headed up by a peculiar guy (the titular character) who wears a big papier mache mask over his head (see the boxcover)- sorta looks like ""Davey"" of the old Lutheran ""Davey & Goliath"" animated series. He's a really nice and creative guy who takes Gleeson under his wing to show him the inner-workings of song-writing and overall creativity, but of course the one thing he and us are all wondering...who is that under that mask???!!<br/><br/>Jump ahead in the film- and they go to work in the States, and one thing leads to another- *SPOILER*- I remember thinking- either we're never going to find out who that is under the mask -OR- it will be someone really famous. I kinda feel a little ignorant now looking at all the descriptions, so it's no secret it turns out to be world-famous actor, Michael Fassbender (""Prometheus"", The Counselor"", the new ""X-men"" films). <br/><br/>I liked this movie because you take away from it a little more than you expected. The music is a side-issue, but again, this is a film about mental illness, and what it may add or take away from artistic endeavors. Fassbender is really good- in spite of the fact we only see his face the last 15 minutes of the film; as is Gleeson. Maggie Gyllenhaal also has a decent role as one of the other band members."

","Frank is an odd film meddling with various themes and emotions as well as showcasing a genre that many movie goers can't label with ease. The movie one would think is a dramedy on the music industry and how to achieve fame but there are many more underlining themes that only skim the surface of this movie. The movie tells the story of Jon a wanna be musician who is given a chance to join this quirky band called the Soronprfbs lead by this mysterious character called Frank who always seen wearing a paper mache head. There were many ways this film could have gone and even until the end of the movie because Frank was one of the most unpredictable characters I have witnessed. All the other characters were fairly interesting as well because they all had their own problems whether it be mental problems or self esteem or some other issue. This made the members parallel in a way showing that music acts as some kind of a therapy to liberate us from our busy lives. The acting was good as well and Fassenbender did a great performance making the character Frank the cornerstone of the movie with his unpredictable nature. The movie is also very mysterious and vague regarding its message and we don't get to learn much of Frank other than his interactions without seeing his face. <br/><br/>7/10 Interesting movie"

","At first sight, Frank seems like a quirky, indie movie that you don't quite know where it will end up. Once you connect with the story and the characters, I believe the comic part of the film will resonate more. Basically, this movie tells the story of a young man attempting to make it big in music. When he is brought in to an unusual band with the lead vocalist wearing a big paper head all of the time, he will not only discover his true intentions, but also affect the band in the long haul. I was mostly pleased with the story, with all it's complexities and messages. The comedy was spot on though, with the laughs coming out the right way. Don't expect a laugh out loud riot, as this is a more restrained comedy. Still Frank was an enjoyable experience and Fassbender makes the gimmick work to a very acceptable degree.<br/><br/>Rating: 6,5-7/10"
"Rickting","7","0","0","25 January 2015"," Quirky, intelligent indie fare with cinema's coolest paper mache head
","Frank follows a band led by an enigmatic and unique musical genius who wears a Paper Mache head the entire time. It's an unconventional and different type of a movie; a black comedy, a drama and musical biopic rolled into one. Many will not have seen Frank, especially not in the USA, and it's not hard to see why. I like mainstream cinema although it provokes many a rant from me, and I like more dramatic and art-house films too. This doesn't necessarily fall into either category. This is made for film critics. It's quirky, different and distant to the point of being obnoxious, and does not exist to provide entertainment to most cinema goers. Frank is a good film, but it's not a particularly enjoyable one. It's emotionally distant at times, can feel cold due to its dark humour and despite being a comedy the dark themes are not merged with humour with the same balance that the excellent and far better independent drama Calvary from the same year. It will keep many interested for a while, but unfortunately it declines into a bummer of a final act and makes the whole story seem pointless.<br/><br/>Frank is well directed, written and acted though. The direction has a different feel to it and a sense of art, while the script has plenty of sparks and can be funny at times. The performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal and others are all strong, and Michael Fassbender emits plenty of depth, humour, humanity and emotion from inside the giant head. Frank is a dark comedy and this makes it less enjoyable, but it should be admired for trying to tackle difficult themes in a movie of its type. For anyone who's interested in music this is a good film to watch, and at times the film can be interesting. Overall, it's a well done indie flick which isn't very entertaining and has a feeling of emotional distance but at the same time its unusualness can be endearing in a funny sort of way. Other British films such as The Imitation Game and Locke are definitely better than Frank, but Frank is still a decent film and worth checking out if you're it's audience.<br/><br/>7/10"

","According to conventional wisdom Paul McCartney's comfortable upbringing lead directly to the bouncy but inane parts of The Beatles catalog while John Lennon's tortured childhood produced the inspired, timeless bits. In ""Frank"" keyboardist Jon Ronson takes us through his loss of faith in the most cherished artistic belief - that crazy is the soil from which talent springs. His idol, in this fictionalized version of the Frank Sidebottom character, gets presented as a mad musical genius twisted by a bleak upbringing in wildest Kansas. As Ronson integrates in the band the evidence that Frank/Chris is just a decent musician with deep mental problems mounts but Ronson having already committed financially and spiritually continues to tilt at the windmill that eventually the unpronounceably-named band will produce an album for the ages. Step by step, Jon comes to understand that Frank/Chris and bandmate Clara, played in a one-note fashion by Maggie Gyllenhaal, will take any step to avoid coming out from behind the physical and proverbial mask to face an actual audience to be judged on actual work. This progression and the ultimate peeling away of the mask that occurs in the same small Kansas town prompts a fascinating discussion of faith, madness and common beliefs about the artistic temperament. In short, a very under-appreciated film well worth your time."

This story was weird, yes, but it got the point across that no matter what imperfections one may have, there will always be somebody who shares and accepts them. Frank, played by Michael Fassbender, seems to be outgoing, but at the same time struggles with himself and his imperfections. While many look up to him, he looks down on himself.

","So before you realize that the paper mâché head thing is not a gimmick, you will have to relish the fact that Frank tells a story about a dysfunctional rock band whose members defy synergy. Each one of them is self-obsessed, giving rise to an inexplicable method of event- unfolding of the X-gen rock music scene.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender as the titular character is great, as he leads the band into darkness. They don't covet fame nor money as is implied in a lot of sequences. It is unclear what they want, except that they want to create music and miserably fail at it. The band members talk and contradict, and everybody wants to be like Frank or be with him.<br/><br/>The whole psychology of an eccentric band is hackneyed. While a guy who aspires to be a great musician, who is himself obsessed with social media, tries his hand at joining this so-called band, we, as an audience, are fed with crumbs of tomfoolery. The final stretch will make you barf, if at all you survive the numbness of the thematic captivation of Irish woods. Death is handled clumsily in the plot and so is music.<br/><br/>While I am impressed with the direction, photography, special effects, and editing, I stayed unimpressed with the story throughout 90 minutes.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: With deadpan music swaying in the air, Frank is a phonetic tale of madness told through the eyes of a musician whose realization that he has landed somewhere he doesn't belong serves as a boring climax. Quirkiness is, hence, not enough. You may try skimming through it if you get a free copy.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"
"mistercsays1","9","3","8","27 June 2014"," Frankly Fabulous
","Few filmmakers have successfully been able to weave absurdist humour into an affecting story about friendship, mental illness and the power of music in quite the same way that Director Lenny Abrahamson has done with Frank. This is a funny yet moving story about a group of flawed individuals who find solace and security in the collective of a band whose mere existence is more important than anything they may achieve. This is a wonderful movie that will no doubt be dismissed by many as just another quirky independent film, but it is so much more than that. With Frank, Abrahamson has crafted a film that is everything a movie should be. It is thoroughly entertaining, emotional, thought provoking and powerful in its examination of an aspect of the world in which we live that is rarely represented with any insight or compassion. It is emotional without being manipulative and it is funny without mocking the characters and/or their circumstances.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson (About Time) is Jon Burroughs, a wannabe songwriter and musician who still lives with his parents and spends his days at a mind-numbingly boring office job. When the keyboard player in the band Soronprfbs is hospitalised after attempting to drown himself, Jon is in the right place at the right time and is drafted in as a substitute. Although the gig is a disaster, Jon makes an impression on Frank Sidebottom - the enigmatic leader of the band who wears an oversized head at all times – and is offered a permanent place in the band. When the group, which also includes Don (Scoot McNairy), Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Baraque (Francois Civil) and the all-but-mute Nana (Carla Azar), head to an isolated cabin to record an album, Jon struggles to understand the motivations of the band and finds himself at loggerheads with the protective Clara. As the recording process drags on interminably, Jon takes to posting regular updates on social media that ultimately result in an offer to perform at the prestigious South by Southwest Festival in Texas. Whilst Frank is excited by the opportunity, the rest of the group are less enthusiastic, with good reason as it turns out.<br/><br/>Frank never removes the fake head; even to sleep, eat or shower and, as a result, the audience, like Jon, spends a lot of time trying to work out exactly why Frank refuses to reveal his identity. What is he hiding? What is his story? Jon's fixation is very much a statement about contemporary society; the fact that we seem to think we have the right to know everything about an individual and can find out anything we want at the click of a button. Conversely, Frank's papier-mache appendage is a challenge to modern celebrity culture in which the face – and the image – of musical artists is often more celebrated than the music they produce. None of the other band members share Jon's curiosity, they simply accept Frank how he is and are deeply suspicious of this newcomer to whom Frank has taken a liking. Although Frank is vague and dismissive anytime Jon tries to delve a little deeper, the reasons for the mask become clearer as the film progresses. Beginning as a hapless interloper who we initially find amusing as the fish out of water amongst this group, Jon ultimately morphs into a somewhat unsympathetic character in his determination to fulfil his own dreams of musical success with little regard for the rest of the band.<br/><br/>The spectre of mental illness runs throughout the narrative, sometimes tragically, but Abrahamson avoids sentimentality. There are damaged people here, but in many ways this is a celebration of those people who exist on the margins of what we generally accept as being 'normal'. Watching this, I couldn't help but wonder how somebody like Frank would be treated in the real world. As the enigmatic, insecure titular character, Michael Fassbender (Shame, 12 Years a Slave, X-Men) is forced to speak with his body; communicating his emotions and state of mind via posture, tics and mannerisms. He does a fabulous job in presenting Frank as a man whose talents are undermined by significant psychological distress, perhaps much in the vein of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett. With Frank, Abrahamson has produced a highly original film that leaves you amused and moved in equal measure. A comedic, tragic, satirical, poignant paean to those who dance to a different beat. It's weird, but it works. In fact, it is something rather exceptional."
"dax-lloyd","9","2","5","18 September 2014"," Frank is more than a Papier Mache head, more than a man, and more than a band.
","Having not experienced the comedy of Chris Sievey, I have come into this film based on the jacket cover. I was not disappointed. <br/><br/>This is not a comedy or a drama or an action flick, rather it is a tale being told about a band. Not just any band but the band Soronprfbs, and their quest to make music.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson, the tale's narrator, plays his quirky, awkward, downtrodden character (Jon Burroughs) with ease. A wannabe musician, dreaming of making music. He stumbles upon Soronprfbs who by stroke of chance are short of a keyboard player. After a very quick try-out he is brought along to help in cutting an album. The head of the band is Frank (Michael Fassbender) a charismatic individual who finds inspiration in everything, all experienced from inside a large Papier Mache head. Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) brings depth and colour to everything she is in. She is the anti-hero, the one whose aggressive and threatening view on life provides a great counter balance to Gleeson's cheerful naiveté. The three other important band members are Don, engineer and primary supporter of Jon, Baraque the guitarist and Nana on drums.<br/><br/>For the majority of the film, it centred on just the band, with minor interruptions from external characters, so it made it seem very intimate, getting into their heads. <br/><br/>I found the film to be very captivating. There wasn't much to the story, as it is a simple premise as far as story lines go. But the interaction between characters filled the gaps. They initially appeared wooden and very stereotypically 'alternate', but very quickly the characters breathed life into the film.<br/><br/>The music is not classical, nor rock, nor pop. It is very eclectic, with half the songs in the movie written and performed by the band. I can't get the tune 'I love you all' out of my head.<br/><br/>This is one of my top films for the year."
"FilmMuscle","7","2","5","7 September 2014"," Quirky Fun Mixed With Dramatic Flair
","The film marvelously commences as a stultified, young aspiring musician named Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) treads the streets of England, struggling to brainstorm ideas for a song. (I'm sure many of us—at some time in our lives—were randomly struck with a terrific idea for a song on a relaxed stroll or during a nice dinner.) This man tries to make something up from every observation. ♫""Lady in the red coat, what you doing with that bag? Lady in the blue coat, do you know the lady in the red coat?""♫ And finally, a less transparent and more obscure idea for a song suddenly pops into the mind as he nears his home—a song about ""little boxes."" The ridiculous songs will never end! He skips past the dinner and casual conversation with the parents to quickly jut down his ideas (the lyrics with the exact tune/pitch) before they're forever forgotten. <br/><br/>Soon thereafter, he serendipitously runs into a band that's performing that same night. With their insane keyboardist, Lucas, trying to drown himself in the ocean in the background as cops circle around, the band manager hires Jon on the spot. And from there, he meets the band's peculiar, yet utterly genial, vocalist who invariably wears a large toy head, Frank (Michael Fassbender). After becoming familiar with the atmosphere and folk, Jon escapes his monotonous life for a short period with the band for an apparent gig in Ireland, but he soon realizes that they're all going to be staying in a cabin to record their next album. For how long, exactly? The band doesn't care to clarify even though Jon is expected back at his regular job come the following Monday. <br/><br/>What follows is an unexpected series of days that reveal the bizarre characters of these people to their new member; he discovers that Don (Scoot McNairy), the band's manager, was once admitted into a mental hospital for his obsessive attraction to mannequins. Another member, Clara (Maggie Gyllenhall), is overly possessive and dismissive. So, he then stands by every night as Frank and the crew drunkenly wrestle and fling sticks at each other. What has he signed up for—the ultimate hippy clan? But his thoughts are conflicting because, at the same time, he finally feels free in the deepest parts of this forest, secluded from conformity and culture, and now at liberty to truly express his innermost artistic spirit—allow his mind to go wild like his fellow members clearly have. <br/><br/>Alas, this means spending months producing cringe-worthy music and laughable lyrics that cause even the members to squirm at each other's disappointing compositions. Jon isn't allowed the time to shine while the naïve Frank excitedly presents his newest creations to awkward silence. It's going to take a while for their talent to seriously emerge and for the work to garner real attention. <br/><br/>Undeniably, the most compelling aspect of the picture is this enigmatic presence that is Frank—finding out more about his background and personality, as well as witnessing Fassbender's amazing charm and charisma exude from behind a mere mask. His intriguing and equally amusing diction, next to his eccentric, child-like personality, certainly creates one of the most memorable characters of the year. The film does get considerably more gloomy and poignant as it progresses, focusing more on the impact of creative failure and mental instability rather than the heavy concentration on music which pervaded the first half. <br/><br/>Suddenly, we begin to see different facets of Frank, other than the occasional quirky freak-out's and pensive postures. He becomes more of an adorable child that's in frightful need of consolation and encouragement. Frank, while not the most even/consistent of plots and indelible of stories, is primarily fueled by the sheer energy and versatility of Fassbender's astonishing performance. Will he finally reveal his actual face? What's behind there? Who really is Frank? The narrative gradually begins to tell us that he's actually filled with much more humanity and internal trouble than the early cartoonish figure seemed to indicate. <br/><br/>If you're entering this film and expecting some ""kick-ass"" rock music, Frank is definitely not that kind of hip movie, but you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the hilarity that ensues from parodying the beginning of a garage band. Nearly every track you hear will make you cringe with its painfully dull and uninspired lyrics, which is exactly what brilliantly makes it so darn hysterical."

The movie ends with the band getting together again and jamming to Frank's lead, with Jon only watching.<br/><br/>The story rolls out all too like any indie spirited movie, with the constant gloomy lonesome mood. The pace is at the slightly slowed down speed, perfect in combination of the mood and the normal take on photography. It's nice to see that the story unveils perfectly over the course of only ninety minutes or so duration. Although it's quite regrettable that being a movie with somewhat strong mystery genre aura, Frank (2014) doesn't offer any surprising plot line or twist. It goes all too predictable.<br/><br/>One mentionable thing is the music indeed. The music in Frank (2014) is indeed a not rare find amongst indie musicians, incorporating a lot of electronic sound modification and samplings. Done in a grunge and britpop mix, the songs don't necessarily offer great vocals. What makes the music different is that the lyrics and melodies are very catchy.<br/><br/>The acting is indeed more than a decent performance. Domhnall Gleeson did a decent job in maintaining the role of the story teller focus character although the story focuses on Fassbender's character. Having big senior names such as Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scott McNairy is nice in boosting attention and awareness as well attracting viewers for this movie. Seeing Michael Fassbender act without actually seeing his face up until late into the movie is indeed a nice new experience. This concept has been done before, but again it feels quite different due to Michael Fassbender is the one doing it.<br/><br/>My final say for Frank (2014) is a score of 7 out of 10. A recommendation is only for those of you are real life musicians or music enthusiasts, or those who have high patience to wait until the story gets interesting."

","The last time I saw a movie where I bought the soundtrack immediately following was for Swiss Army Man. But that movie wasn't about music - it just happened to have a fantastic soundtrack. Frank IS about music (and musicians), and the fictional band isn't just ""pretty darn good for a fictional band"" - THEY ARE EXCELLENT AS A BAND. I was sorta thinking Joy Division and The Residents, but somebody else said Flaming Lips and Jim Morrison, and I can kinda see that too.<br/><br/>The film very much nails the creative process too. On the soundtrack it was great to hear the film's improvisation and genesis version of ""I Love You All"" as well as the finished studio production (that doesn't appear in the film per se, but would have been the fictional band's attempt at recording a rehearsed and more developed version of the song). I relate to this process, as I've been in several (original music) bands for 35+ years (earning several hundred dollars in total so far, so yeah, it was a success!)"
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","6 June 2015"," Not an easy, accessible film but one that is engaging in what it does with the comedy and also the ideas of creativity, individualism and mental illness (SPOILERS)
","Not sure if it is a prerequisite of posting here to use the word ""quirky"" to describe this film, but if you did a word-cloud of the user comments here then I guess it would appear as one of the bigger words. The plot sees a standard young man – boring office job, playing at writing songs in his bedroom on his computer – who gets caught up in a deliberately outsider band of musicians, the lead singer of which has a history of mental illness and spends every minute of his life wearing an oversized papier-mâché head. Said young man (Jon) joins them for what he assumed would be an one-off gig, but then ends up staying in a remote location to record their album.<br/><br/>There are many thoughts I had watching this film, and I am not entirely sure how to structure them into a meaningful order so that I can deliver this user comment in a way that makes sense. Since this had never stopped me before, then I will have a run at it here. There are many things. The first is that I do remember Sidebottom as an odd alt-culture character who existed on the edge of my awareness; I knew his name and what he looked like, but beyond that, not much detail – so I really brought nothing into this film in that regard, and treated it like a work of fiction. The second thing that struck me is the feeling of creative people not always being those who are seen as stars – together, sexy, beautiful people who everyone loves, but rather people who are out there, being creative for themselves rather than others. One person who came to mind is musician Jean Grae – someone who I continue to love, not because her output is always brilliant, but rather because her output is always what she wants it to be – so whether hip-hop, audio-books, or self- help albums, she is doing herself and feeling good about it – she will never be Jay-Z, but I love that she simply doesn't seem to care about this.<br/><br/>I thought of her while watching Frank because there is an element of this in the film – particularly where Jon walks away at the end, convinced that this world is not for him and that he really only ever saw popularity as the goal, not being happy with one's self (as shown by his on-screen social media, with follows/likes always displayed). This is the end of the film, and it is an interesting place for it to go since it does begin with a rather comedic focus on Jon, and then the introduction of the oddly comedic Sidebottom. The journey of the film gradually gets darker and less funnier though – which is not an easy sell but one that does work. The focus shifts from Jon's journey to be one that he is outside of, and while it is heavy in oddity and difficulties, it is strangely engaging. It touches on creativity, on mental illness, and on a spirit that Jon (and I) admire but do not share, and in doing all these things it is both flawed but yet effective.<br/><br/>The cast are impressive. Of course the headline is Fassbender, who is a huge star but yet spends the vast majority of the film as a 1980/90's UK masked cult figure. His performance is solid until the end, when it is great – producing a strong ending which lifts the film. Same can be said of Gyllenhaal, who is another surprise find in such an odd film. Gleeson is good because he leads when he needs to, but yet also can transition into the different film we are left with. Outside of these three the support is generally good. Abrahamson's direction is of high quality, and the writing produces an effective mix of the odd, comedic, dark, and engaging.<br/><br/>Frank is not a film for everyone – at times I was not sure it was a film for me; but it works. It draws you in with a comedic sense of oddity, but left me with much more than I expected – a piece about individuality, creativity, mental illness and dedication. It is not the film I expected and, while not an easy viewing, it s probably a better film for it."

"KnightsofNi11","8","1","2","7 February 2015"," As weird as it gets
","Ah, Frank. What an odd, quirky, charming little film, and what an odd, quirky little journey it took me on. With its wildly weird for the sake of weird style and and careless indie pop bravado, it's a movie that any misunderstood avant garde hipster musician will tell you actually ""gets it."" If none of this is making sense so far, Frank is a movie about an experimental rock group whose front man, the titular Frank, wears a giant plaster head at all times. It's a film whose premise promises the oddest of antics, and then subsequently delivers on that promise.<br/><br/>Frank is freaking weird and it loves the fact that its freaking weird. It embraces the weird and dances around frivolously with its offbeat sense of humor and colorful cast of caricatured characters. It's a film that has its own sense of style and isn't trying to be like anything that has come before it, which is something that makes Frank a hell of a lot of fun. It definitely has its own sense of humor, one that is so weird that it works beautifully. The plot, which involves chronicling this band as they lock themselves in a cabin in the woods to make the greatest album ever, is pretty straightforward. But everything about the film's humor, style, and energy is everything but straightforward. It's a totally original kind of experience.<br/><br/>The main character of Frank that isn't Frank is Domhnall Gleeson's Jon, a musician who finds himself playing keyboard for Frank's band, a band where he stands out as quite possibly the only sane one out of all of them. Taking the film from his perspective grounds us in the real world that is inhabited by Frank and company's frenetic and unpredictable energy. He's an outsider looking into one of the strangest experiences of his life, just as the audience is outside looking in to this weird world of Frank. Without him this whole film would just be following this eccentric group of weirdos, which would admittedly be fun, but wouldn't allow the story to have as much substance, which Frank certainly has. <br/><br/>But taking Gleeson's straightman character and putting him with the rest of this wacky cast makes for a great time. Michael Fassbender's performance as Frank is one of the strangest and most hilariously unique performances I've ever seen. I can only imagine the difficulties of acting without the use of your face, but Fassbender nails it. He gives the emotionless plaster head so much personality that is way too much fun to watch. <br/><br/>The one thing about Frank that threw me for a loop was its third act which changed drastically in tone. It was a fairly sudden jump from wacky comedy to heartfelt drama, one that breaks down the beautiful enigma that was Frank for the first two acts. It caught me off guard, but with Frank's great ending note I think it actually worked. <br/><br/>All in all, Frank is almost too damn quirky for its own good, but its just so much fun. For entertainment value Frank is an A+. It's a movie where you're never completely sure what you're watching and you're not sure what the point of any of the film's strangeness really is, but you're having too much fun to really care. Frank is a blast and you will be hard pressed to find anything quite like it. It's its own brand. The enigmatic Frank brand."

","Much like our main head gear waring protagonist, the movie Frank has a slight problem, something you see is just not quite right, even though at moments there is a lot of good going on. Lenny Abrahamson's follow up to his very astute and confronting What Richard Did is a hugely dark comedy that concerns itself at every available turn to be as downright weird as possible and therefore alienate its audience at every given opportunity despite some A grade acting turns by its cast.<br/><br/>To say Frank is a strange film is a humongous understatement but to say Frank is a bad film would be a disservice to a story that in its brightest flickering's provides some of the funniest and most whimsical moments captured on screen this year. From Frank dancing with a tourist in the meadows to Frank jigging up a storm in a CD recording, there are great moments here that somehow continue to be lost in a procession of strangely uninteresting titbits, not least the films fascination with its forest placed setting. Frank's flow seems to constantly run into roadblocks and a cast of originally interesting characters grow to become non-interesting and mismanaged to a point where our centrepiece Jon Burroughs played by the always decent Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal's sour Clara and Scott McNairy's not given enough to do Don all fail to give us much with the film falling back onto the ever reliable shoulders of Michael Fassbender to once more bring it back.<br/><br/>Fassbender is a real joy as Frank (based on real life musician Chris Sievey) which is no mean feat considering his recognisable face is hidden behind a gigantic plastic head. Under Fassbender's talents which here include singing and as mentioned dancing, Frank becomes the reason to watch. While Frank somewhat transpires into a bit of a letdown of a character arc there is little to deny the entertainment watching him get to where he ends up and if the film focused less on side elements of the tale the film would of benefited greatly. The cast also shine most when there well and truly rocking out to the jam of their musical crescendos and more loud utterly bonkers jam sessions would've been welcomed.<br/><br/>Crossing the line too much into the states of being weird for the sake of being weird, Frank is a disappointment when all is considered, from the talented cast, the promising director and ripe story line potential all does not feel fully developed here. While it may touch upon that zany creative madness/greatness that many bands and musicians no doubt go through in their quest for musical glories, Frank feels like an album full of listenable tracks but no stand out singles. If your heading into Frank for some more proof Fassbender is one of the most powerful performers in the industry you're in luck, everything else here is only passable at best.

","To try and create a film based on or around the life of musician Chris Sievey, frontman of 70's/80's group The Freshies, or his alter-ego Frank Sidebottom, a paper-mache-head donning presenter with a thick Mancunian accent, would be absolute folly. Rather than attempting to create such a redundant biopic, director Lenny Abrahamson, and writers Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan, have used Sidebottom's legacy and traits as a template to toast eccentric (and possibly mad) artists everywhere and condemn the new social media platform which does little to celebrate them.<br/><br/>Young, aspiring and likely talentless keyboard player Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) cannot believe his luck when Don (Scoot McNairy), member of avant-garde group the Soronprfbs, invites Jon to play with them following the mental decline of their own keyboardist. He packs and eagerly joins them, only to arrive in a countryside hut in Ireland where the band are to stay indefinitely to complete their next album. Theremin player Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) responds to Jon's inclusion with aggression, but Jon is taken by the group's charismatic singer, Frank (Michael Fassbender), a man who refuses to take off his giant, paper-mache mask or conform to the traditional song-writing process.<br/><br/>As the album gets closer to completion (with Jon growing a huge beard in the process), the band become popular due to Jon's frequent Twitter and Facebook video postings revealing their unconventional recording techniques, frequent outbursts and erratic behaviour. It is from this that the film succeeds in it's satire of an increasingly connected world. The followers start to pile up, and it looks as if their first gig will be well attended. But is it the music the fans are in it for? Or do they simply wish to witness first-hand the collapse of a band so riddled with idiosyncrasies that they have become the subject of blood-thirsty ridicule? Jon, finding himself completely seduced by the attention and becoming increasingly dislikeable, lusts for fame at the expense of art and originality.<br/><br/>At the centre of it all, is Frank himself, wonderfully played by Fassbender (although you wouldn't guess it was him under that mask). His innocence, and clear mental instability, is reminiscent of Daniel Johnston, the schizophrenic singer-songwriter from California, who creates beautiful work in his own unique way, despite the odds against him. Frank, with no trace of irony, asks Jon ""why cover anything up?"". Frank the character and Frank the movie are, in equal measures, funny, moving, thrilling, and best of all, really f*****g weird. A third a celebration of pure, unfiltered art, another a sad portrayal of our sadistic thirst for freak-shows, but most of all, this is a superb story wonderfully told."

","(58%) An oddball comedy/drama that's centred equally around music and musicians than it is about mental illness.

Combined with the nutty shenanigans this offers fine performances from the strong cast, some very well crafted writing, and really quite faultless direction. Despite there being enough plot, character, humour, and substance to fill its 85 or so minutes this really isn't something for everyone, or indeed something that every film fan must watch, as it's a movie largely about a group misfit ex-mental patients clanging together pots and pans, one of whom with a Frank Sidebottom likened head, which really is strange for the sake of being strange.

","Any film where one member of the cast wears a mask for all but one scene is going to be a little unusual unless its Star Wars. <br/><br/>Frank tells the story of Jon, I want to be music writer who constantly writes lyrics in his head to any given situation. Leading a fairly direction-less life otherwise he accidentally witnesses the attempted suicide of the keyboard player of a travelling band led by papermache head wearing lead singer, Frank, apparently played by Michael Fassbender, (though I cannot help but wonder if a body doubled did all the scenes for him until the end and he did ADR the rest.) <br/><br/>Frank never takes off his mask, not even in the shower, the rest of the band take to Jon with varying mixed degree's. He thinks their going to Ireland to do a gig for the weekend, the band has plans to stay in the woods and record music until the find the perfect sound which as it turns out is a very long time. Jon clashes with some of the band, finds understanding in others and has strange and revealing conversations with Frank leading him to wonder if he will ever shed his mask. It is a film about the masks we all can wear at times and does ask something interesting questions about judging people by their actions rather than their looks. Eventually this all spirals to a collision that for some will have far reaching consequences. <br/><br/>Frank is a really hard film to label, let alone describe. It's certainly not something you can easily dismiss, even if its not to your taste. There's something very watchable about Domhall Gleeson as the lead Jon, a young man out of his depth, he's likable and too me made the film bearable as most of the time I couldn't really hear Frank's muffled words and the other band members were annoying at best and arbitrary to the story for the most part. the film is Jon's Journey and how he grows around people who think their more talented than perhaps they really are. As a story about the torture and eccentricity being genius this is a film that works well except for the fact that the band don't seem that talented to begin with. Just as things really get bogged down the action shifts to America and there is a little change of tone. As a dark comedy the film is not without its laughs and somber moments following in quick succession but overall its a hard film to recommend to people as it feels akin to Marmite, you're probably either love it or hate it. I think I will probably need to watch it again to decide.<br/><br/>When Fassbender is definitively on screen his performance is moving and believable as always and the film is beautifully shot by James Mather so there is much to admire in the film along with the fact that it is at least original. <br/><br/>I have read since the character of Frank has been partially inspired by an actual singer, but to me that's not really relevant as this is clearly a fictional story. Those with experience of the extreme persona's of the music world will probably relate more to the characters and their dilemmas than those that do not, but this isn't a film about the music industry, that is simply the backdrop for a narrative that is a statement about people and the way we see and interact with each other. On this level the film offers some interesting insights. While I am not sure if that has enough momentum to charge a movie, its certainly a commendable effort."
"MartinHafer","7","1","2","12 October 2014"," Quirky is the best way to describe this one...
","""Frank' is NOT a film for everyone, as it is totally bizarre and makes very little sense at times. However, it DID make me laugh and even smile a bit. It has a quirky strangeness that I liked and I am glad I saw it, though it think it would be a hard film to sell on the average person--mostly because it makes little attempt to be conventional.<br/><br/>The film begins with Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) in Scotland. He's an apparently talentless young man (who looks a lot like Rupert Grint-- the guy who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films) who somehow is still quite happy. One day, he meets a guy from a band who needs a keyboard player and Jon tells him he can play--and he's in the band with no try-out! Well, he turns out to be horrible and can barely play the keyboard at all--which would be a SERIOUS problem with 99.99% of the bands in the world. However, this one is very avant-garde--more like a combination of a New Wave band and performance art. The bottom line is that NONE of them seem to have much musical talent at all and their 'music' is not good. The most talented of the band's members is Frank--a seriously mentally ill man who wears a giant Jack-in-the Box style head! In fact, he NEVER removes the head and sings in it, sleeps in it and even drinks nutrients through a straw in it! He's odd...but the rest of the band is pretty weird as well and apparently Frank and another band member met while institutionalized. Despite these folks being ultra- weird, perhaps the most misplaced of all is some ways is Jon, as he does not appear to have any talent whatsoever. Yet, oddly, he is able to somehow fit in with this group of misfits. And, by the end of the film they somehow manage to become a sensation. The bottom line is that the film is apparently never intended for a huge audience--it's more of a quirky niche film. Because of this and the bizarreness of the characters, it's definitely an acquired taste. In many ways, this reminds me of ""Napoleon Dynamite""--a film many folks love and many hate because they think it just doesn't make any sense. It is NOT a film for everyone--mostly just for folks who don't mind a meandering plot, a lot of stuff that makes no sense as well as many strange, almost nonsensical characters. As for me...I actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>By the way, if you think that the idea of a severely mentally ill guy becoming a sensation as a lead singer and songwriter sounds impossible, watch the film ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"". Johnston, a real artist and musician, despite a severe Bipolar Disorder and a history of ultra- bizarreness is both a huge hit within certain circles. I wonder if his life was in any way the inspiration for Frank.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Rex Reed picked this film as one of the worst of 2014. Considering all the interesting and quirky parts, I wouldn't agree but I could see someone objecting to the film overall as it certainly is strange. I like strange but not everyone wants that in a movie."

","I'm sure only a few of you will remember Frank Sidebottom from the 1970's but he was a man who went around and wore a huge paper mashie head, he had a TV Show and was from Manchester. Honestly, I have no idea how that all leads to the movie Frank which is about a man wearing a head and being in a band from America but still, here is it all the same. So I suppose the reel question is will this be A Rock For Ages? Or just some Blues, Brother? Frank is strange. There is just no getting around it, the whole film is a surreal journey into the mind of a total lunatic who's motives and reasoning only become clear at the end of the film, which personally I love. I think this is a bold movie. I defy anyone to find me another film like Frank in the last 10 years, because it is somehow totally relevant while being off it's crazy rocker too. They are two difficult hats to wear at the same time. One demands discipline and a reality to it and the other beckons you into a world of pure imagination where ANTHING is possible.<br/><br/>How this duality is maintained is that we are given a window into this world via Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), he is an average man. He is a bored human who is trying to write songs and ultimately find his voice with his chosen creative outlet, it's a place we have all been. This is the relatable part of the film, this man is us. However he is quickly drawn into a world of total chaos by Soronprfbs; an electric band which Jon stumbles upon and there bizarre front man Frank (Michael Fassbender).<br/><br/>In truth I am unconfident in calling Frank a comedy or any kind of genre at all really, it isn't laugh out loud funny, but at times it is pitch black in it's humour. Frank is truly a movie that defies definition, it's a film that shift and moves restless in its own skin and demanding you to consider it, and you do, because ultimately when it matters most Frank doesn't bottle out with the hard hitting stuff, Frank makes you confront your own darkest desires and they are wrong. The way this is revealed to us is nothing short of perfection.<br/><br/>Frank also has a very cunning use of social media, the film isn't just a crazy ride down a rabbit hole. No the movie also provides social commentary on how stardom is made in current society. Frank cuts through all the usual playfulness you find in a film and holds each of us accountable for what is happening to the characters.<br/><br/>Frank is masterfully played by Micheal Fassbender, but he is a man who is humble enough to know this isn't his show, it is Domhnall's and he is perfect for it, this is Dom's movie and everyone knows it.<br/><br/>Frank is a film that is one of those rare films that is so bold you truly don't know what to make of it, at times it is beautiful poetry and at others it strays into total madness. No matter what it is, it's powerful."

","Frank had me in its first five minutes. As Jon, played by rising star Domhnall Gleeson, tries to write his very own song, it's either terrible or too derivative of classics. Although the film breaks the rules with its use of voice over and so on, it's all the better for being more free flowing, and it's incredibly hilarious with its sharp wit. It has the deadpan humour you often see in British TV, but it works here and is thoroughly welcome. I had my doubts about Gleeson, but he instantly won me over with his charm, though the characters do call him out when he's annoying. Unfortunately supporting characters are more like moods than anything, even with Maggie Gyllenhaal and the always awesome Scoot McNairy, hardly scratching their surface.<br/><br/>However, the film's eponymous figure, is not such a gimmick and Michael Fassbender's Frank is a true delight worthy of the praise the film gives him. He may have a mask over his head for the majority of the film but he still as an endearing energy about him. Fassbender is funnier than he's ever been but he also brings in a dramatic weight, especially in the third act. Above all, the appeal is in its portrayal of the pursuit making artistic yet likable music, showing it as something to be crafted over a year, ala Captain Beefheart, or it could be something spontaneous and irreverent. The film makes both work but it's clear there's not a simple answer to what is an objective good song, though the film has a wonderful naive score that had me grinning from ear to ear. The only thing that held it back is when it rushes or gets too silly but otherwise Frank is a joy. <br/><br/>8/10"

","This strange movie was inspired by the experience of writer Jon Ronson who spent a while as a keyboard player with a band led by the late British Chris Sievey, the creator the comedy character Frank Sidebottom who wore a huge head which he never removed. The cast includes two actors whom I really admire: Michael Fassbender who plays the eponymous mystery figure and Maggie Gyllenhaal who is one of the band players. Both actors are known for willing to take roles out of the mainstream - think ""Shame"" for Fassbender and ""Secretary"" for Gyllenhaal - but I have no idea why they would waste their time on this oddity.<br/><br/>In so far as the film seems to pose any kind of question worth thinking about, it seems that both the group at the heart of the 'story' and the film itself are asking us: should art be simply for the artist or should it aspire to an audience? I guess ""Frank"" is like an optical illusion: you either get it or you don't - and I didn't. Many critics loved it, but I found it slow, pretentious, self-indulgent and - frankly (pun intended) - boring. I gather it was supposed to be a comedy but I found it simply sad."

I think the more probable case is the latter, but still even is this is true the movie definitely has highlights.<br/><br/>Micheal Fassbender. Micheal Fassbender. Oh my god Micheal Fassbender. I will not spoil anything of how the story of Frank goes down, but what I will say is that every second spent with Fassbender on screen was absolutely worth it. He brought life to a character that would have certainly come off as plain bad in the hands of a lesser actor and lets face it there really aren't that many actors as good as Fassbender, he is definitely one of my favorites. He added a truly engaging element with the moves he made with the mask on. On the top of that we have a movie that does not have a tangible story. I really didn't't take away anything. I have baffled at how everything was brought on with absolutely no sense of coherence. And I do understand that maybe that was the intent of the filmmakers, to make something that was ""out"" that was totally exaggerated, but the vibe wasn't clear. Yes the movie has many funny moments, but that's where the good moments stop. I'm not going to say that this movie is in anyway bad. None of the scenes or the events portrayed made me cringe, angry or bored , and that's something that happens very often in a bad movie, but I will not say that I was in anyway truly entertained for more that 2 consecutive minutes and in anyway had an emotional connection with any of the characters. There's a whole social media aspect used in the movie that took me out of it from second one, it felt so unnecessary. Moreover the photography was off for me. It didn't capture what I wanted to see, nor the vibe the movie was supposedly going for, it was very bleak and I didn't get the choices behind it. Plus the musical element of the movie isn't really good. There are maybe one and half decent songs, but for the majority it was just weird. And if you're telling ""but James it was meant to be weird!"" well I'll say that I didn't get it and that the movie didn't take me on enough for me to buy into the weirdness."

","I don't do this often but want to express my satisfaction in a few words. I am a musician (amateur but I still rock my drums) and I am all about musical chemistry... To me, music is about chemistry, alchemy.. mixing things.. and this movie is about what happens when the balance, or PH, changes... the substance changes as a result... <br/><br/>The individual performances are great too and you see actors that we believed to be only ""suited for Harry Potter"" really shine as he brought his character to life.. all the actors were great and the direction was perfect for what they wanted to achieve.<br/><br/>Surprised that it had very little repercussion, such an interesting movie and it gives people an insight of what it means to be creative and to create things, such as music."

","Frank was a worthwhile cinema viewing experience, but still not sure if I really enjoyed the film. In the words of Maxwell Smart, I would say it ""missed it by this much"". The film had potential, there are so many funny scenes that make you laugh out loud, at the same point, there are so many missed opportunities. I think the cast was perfectly chosen and they play up to the ""darkness"" of the comedy. I think the social media aspect of Twitter and You tube were very cool and made the movie seem almost real. The acting was very good considering the unique aspects of the film. I will always think ""what if"" on this film, it could have been a ten."
"comicman117","9","1","3","28 September 2014"," A Hysterical Black Comedy That Has To Be Seen To Be Believed
","Frank features a poster which depicts a giant cartoon head. Now some people who haven't seen the trailer might assume that it's just there for the point of advertising, or there's an animated sequence in the film, but no, the title character of the film is a man who dresses up in a cartoon head. That seems in of itself a crazy concept, but it fits with the rest of the film, which goes from being a quirky dark comedy to basically being down right serious and realistic at the end. In short, Frank is a gem that I can recommend to just about anyone, unless men wearing cartoon faces and crazy antics isn't your idea of a good time. <br/><br/>Frank tells the story of Jon Burroughs (played by Domnhall Gleason) who is surprisingly likable and later in the film even works perfect as a jackass when he lets fame get to his head. Burroughs is a young wanna-be musician from Ireland who meets a traveling band. The band is led by Frank played by Michael Fassbender a mysterious cartoon wearing headman. Jon eventually learns that he's gotten himself into more than he can handle by joining this band. <br/><br/>Frank is at its heart a black comedy that eventually evolves into a cross country road-trip film, and then even becomes serious by the end. It's nonetheless a hilarious movie to watch. The script by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan is very clever and includes some memorable dialogue. Although Frank is not the main character of the film (despite the title being named after him), by having his antics be center stage of the film, it makes for interesting and hilarious situations. Frank himself is an interesting character, a man who received a cartoon mask as a teenager and wouldn't take it off, instead preferring to conceal his true face and identity. As the main character, Jon has an interesting character arc in the film himself, going an aspiring almost weak songwriter who can't seem to finish or write any memorable songs, to letting fame get to him, and eventually becoming extremely unlikeable as a person. <br/><br/>The rest of the band, which makes up the bulk of the major characters in the film are also interesting. You have Maggie Gyllenhaal as Clara, the aggressive chick of the group, who rarely has anything nice to say (at least until the end of the film), and has absolutely little regard for Jon as a person. Gyllenhaal is even very sexy in some of her scenes. There's Scoot McNairy as Don, the bands' manager who eventually commits suicide with a Frank mask on and in a rather comical and dark scene they place his body on a boat with flames into the river (basically being his grave) until a slight problem occurs, and ruins the moment for them. Francois Civil as Baraque the French bassist (he literally only speaks French throughout the film) and Carla Azar as Nana, the band's drummer, make up the rest of the cast. Both characters, Baraque and Nana, also show little empathy for Jon. These characters are basically a group of misfits with their own quirks and problems. <br/><br/>Although I had issues with another movie that started out as a quirky comedy, that being Michel Gondry's Mood Indigo, Frank's tonal shift at the end didn't bother me as much as that film did, because in addition to a much weirder and more surrealistic film, Mood Indigo still kept its crazy tone, even at the funeral sequences. In comparison, Frank, became down to earth and less quirky, which I appreciated. <br/><br/>None of the songs in Frank are especially memorable, which is the point of the film, as Jon sees himself as an amazing lyricist, when the best thing he can come up with is repeating the same sound over and over. The actual actors performed in the band, which isn't surprising given that the songs aren't really performed all that memorably to begin with. <br/><br/>Frank is definitely not a movie made with the general audience in mind. I appreciate the film for that, though as its crazy concept, along with the antics, made me laughing and smiling until the last act. Even the tonal shift of the film didn't bother me that much. Frank's black comedy aspect is something I very much appreciate about the film. Frank, is overall an enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to anyone, but be warned, you may not get the concept. Yes, it's that weird of a film and I liked it a lot because of that."
"Hellmant","8","1","3","18 September 2014"," Bizarrely entertaining and subtly moving.
","'FRANK': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Indie comedy-drama flick about a small-time alternative pop/rock band that builds a small fan base, due to their new keyboardist's Twitter and YouTube postings (of the band). The leader of the music group is the quirky titular character Frank; who constantly wears a papier-mâché head and never reveals his face. He's based on the late comic Chris Sievey's popular character Frank Sidebottom. The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scoot McNairy and Michael Fassbender (in the title role). It was directed by Irish filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson and written by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. It's a really weird movie but it's also bizarrely entertaining and subtly moving (at times) as well. <br/><br/>Gleeson plays Jon; a keyboardist who desperately wants to write songs, and be a rock star, but can't find the right motivation to do so. McNairy plays Don; the manager of a quirky unknown pop band called 'Soronprfbs'. When the keyboardist for Soronprfbs (Shane O'Brien) has a mental breakdown, and tries to drown himself, Don asks Jon to fill in for him at a concert (that night). Jon then travels to Ireland, with the band, to record an album with them. The group is filled with multiple eccentric characters; like Clara (Gyllenhaal), who seems to hate Jon, and their mentally ill lead singer Frank (Fassbender). Frank hides his true identity behind a papier-mâché head, which he never removes. Jon posts videos of the band practicing, and Twitter updates of their album's progress, which makes them a mild internet sensation and lands them their first major gig. The newfound popularity threatens to tear them apart though.<br/><br/>The film is really dark and weird; almost to an unlikeable extent. If you can sit through the whole thing though it does finally payoff. The characters are all strangely relatable (and likable) and the movie does have a positive message about doing music just for the love of music, and not seeking out too much success or fame. The performances are all more than decent and Abrahamson seems like he was the right director to bring this bizarre story to life. If you don't mind movies that are really strange, and hard to comprehend, this film might be the right one for you.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto"
"Josh_Friesen","8","1","4","12 September 2014"," Take off the Head Frank
","On the surface Frank appears to be the polar opposite of Lenny Abramson's prior works which were characterised by naturalistic dialogue and settings that emphasized the grey and drab side of Ireland. In contrast Frank sports a bright pallet and contains a group of incredibly eccentric characters including the titular Frank who wears a paper Mache head. However, as the film progresses the eclectic tone and colourful visuals gently falls away to reveal a heartbreaking meditation on mental illness.<br/><br/>We meet our protagonist Jon (Domhall Gleeson) wandering the beach attempting to find inspiration for his music. He is a mediocre keyboard player and vocalist but passionate about his music. Jon is our entry point into the world of Frank as well as our narrator. The voice- over narration, a device which is usually used as a lazy substitute for acting, in this case is used effectively. Jon's voice provides the chaos with some form of structure and allows him to have a conversation with the only character capable of having a conversation in the film; himself.<br/><br/>Jon meets and quickly falls in with Frank's band, the Soronprbs (which has a deliberately unpronounceable name). A band whose music is equal parts strange and wonderful. They are in need of a new keyboard player because, when Jon meets them, their current one is trying to drown himself in the ocean. In a darkly comic nod to This is Spinal Tap we later learn than Jon is actually their third keyboard player. The band is managed by Don (Scoot McNairy), an ex- mental patient due to his sexual preference for manikins. There are four members beside Don and Jon but two of them are never fully fleshed out. They are given the clichéd excuse of being foreign and we soon forget about them. The remaining two are Maggie Gyllenhaal in a wonderfully petulant performance as the Theremin playing Clara and Michael Fassbender as Frank. <br/><br/>The gamble of casting Fassbender in a completely masked role pays off as he delivers surely one of the greatest masked performances ever. The range of emotion he is able to express through the paper mache head is outstanding and it goes without saying that this is his most humorous role yet (dark though it be). He benefits from a well written script but still carries the film with his fine physical performance. <br/><br/>The first two-thirds of the film, while refreshingly unique, suffers at times from inconsistent pacing. The editing fails to balance the conflict between the choppy montage sequences and the meandering band practice scenes. Where the film brings itself together is in the final act when the bright mask of the film is removed to reveal something profound underneath. As I hinted to earlier, one of the running themes of the film is mental illness and it deals with this hard subject in a nuanced way.<br/><br/>More interesting questions arise in the film but I feel that to discuss them would take away from the viewing experience. All I can do is encourage you to seek out this film. It's not a perfect film but in a summer full of blockbuster disappointment it's a distinctly original treat."

"l_rawjalaurence","8","1","5","5 September 2014"," Bitter-Sweet Film Reflecting on the Dividing-Line Between Madness and Sanity
","The plot of FRANK is straightforward - young dude Jon (Domnhall Gleeson) becomes involved with a band headed by Frank (Michael Fassbender). After some considerable time spent in a lonely house in Ireland putting together an album, the band are invited to the United States to perform. Jon assumes an important role in trying to bring the band to a wider public, but finds that his efforts are in vain.<br/><br/>What makes FRANK such an intriguing film is the way director Lenny Abrahamson handles his material. Throughout the action Jon tweets his responses to the band, as well as giving YouTube links, both of which appear regularly on screen; this form of public communication complements his regular voice-overs. It seems on the surface that he is simply narrating a story; but the use of tweets and links indicates his desire for the proverbial fifteen minutes of fame. Jon is the kind of person who welcomes the fact that a video he posts online of the band's performances attracts half a million hits; it indicates some kind of 'success'.<br/><br/>However the band have other reasons for wanting to perform. Frank (Michael Fassbender), who spends most of the movie wearing a gigantic false head, is treated as a quasi-messiah by his fellow band- members, who take notice of his every word. He is quite clearly a very creative person, with a unique line in lyrics, but we are never quite sure what to make of him. The false head not only conceals his face, but his character as well. All we know is that Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has a particular attraction to him, which goes beyond conventional expectations of 'love' and 'relationships.'<br/><br/>Matters come to a head at a gig in Austin, Texas, when Jon discovers to his cost that all his best-laid plans for the band's success come to naught. Frank disappears; and Jon spends much time and energy trying to find him. Although the two of them meet up at the end, the outcome is not quite what Jon expects.<br/><br/>Like Frank, fellow-band member Don (Scoot McNairy) also seems to behave in an irrational (some might say mad) manner; but director Abrahamson makes no judgment on him. Rather he invites us to contemplate on precisely how we can separate 'madness' from 'sanity'. Although Jon appears 'sane' can we therefore judge his behavior to be superior to that of the 'mad' Don or Frank? If the band are happy doing what they are doing, what right has anyone to try to alter their lifestyle? Abrahamson provides no concrete answer to this question.<br/><br/>Although the film's subject-matter is basically serious, there are some fine comic moments, especially in the sequences taking place in the lonely Irish house where the band spend several months trying to put the album together. Jon tries his best to integrate into their way of life, but remains a perpetual outsider. The performances are uniformly excellent, especially from Fassbender and Gyllenhaal as the odd couple. FRANK is quite simply a revelatory movie."

","FRANK (2014) ** Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scoot McNairy, Francois Civil, Carla Azar, Tess Harper, Bruce McIntosh. Knee-deep in indie-ville oddity to say the least - loosely based on Frank Sidebottom, the late British comic entertainer - depicts sad sack office drone wanna be musician Gleeson winding up as a member of a truly eccentric band of artistes, including the titular ring-leader who wears a ginormous Mardi-Gras mask resembling the Coney Island mascot Tillile (Fassbender having a field day by obscuring his ruggedly handsome visage and taking a huge leap of faith) who takes him along for a ride of a lifetime; genius obscurity. While the disjointed storyline by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan and listless direction by novice Lenny Abrahamson barely gel for a rote fish-out-of-water dramedy it does enable the viewer of what the cult of personality can do (and undo) while skirting across the mental health issues outweighed by the free fall of creativity."
"johnnymurphy15","9","1","6","25 June 2014"," An inspired re-imagining of a cult northern figure.
","First of all, this is not a straight up biography of Chris Sievey whose stage name was Frank Sidebottom. The film is inspired by journalist Jon Ronson's article about his time spent playing the keyboards for Frank Sidebottom. What we see in this film is the inspiration taken from Frank Sidebottom's iconic papier mache head, only it is worn by a character who resembles many iconic front men whose image is shrouded in mental illness and mystique. While Frank is the title of the film, he is not the central character. Domhnal Gleeson is the Jon Ronson character who narrates the story about having a pedestrian job and living in a small town, but having aspirations to be a song writer. In his spare time, he walks around the idyllic beach town he lives in looking for lyrical inspiration, but never seems to come up with anything good. During a chance meeting with eccentric avant guard band with the unpronounceable name 'Soronprfbs', he is offered to replace their keyboard player for their show as he is trying to drown himself in the sea. When Jon turns up and plays keyboards for what turns out to be a disastrous show due to technical hitches followed by a band squabble, the enigmatic Frank (Michael Fassbender) is impressed that he wants him to be in the band.<br/><br/>Jon leaves his town and travels to a remote studio in Ireland with the band. Problems arise as he tries to fit in to this band of misfits. He has to get used to the idea that Frank never takes off his head.ever! While he is impressed and in general admiration of Frank and his general eccentric demeanour and his nonchalant ability to write beautiful songs about rudimentary objects like a tuft in a carpet, the rest of the band is hostile towards Jon, especially Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who does not trust him. She thinks that his rather generic approach to song writing will negatively affect Frank. Frank and Clara seem to be a solid experimental song writing duo, but Jon wants some song writing input. In a key scene, we see Jon who after a few unsuccessful attempts, has an idea for a song. While on the keyboard playing his idea to Frank and Clara, Frank starts to make suggestions to make the song more interesting. Clara starts to join in and the songs evolves into something completely different, prompting Jon to storm off.<br/><br/>Due to the band been isolated and overworked, this gives way to much odd behaviour which is fitting to the bands eccentricity. Jon is capturing a lot of footage and putting it on Twitter to raise the bands profile. He manages to get them a gig in SxSW in Texas. The whole situation is exacerbated by increasing tension between Jon and Clara and Frank's mental illness.<br/><br/>I was generally very impressed with this film for so many reasons. The balance between the comedy and the level of depth it goes in to themes like mental illness and creativity is really impressive. Some scenes have a lighter and comedic tone, but it is not afraid to be dark and tragic when it needs to be. The character Frank embodies the enigmatic tortured genius's such as Daniel Johnston, Captain Beefheart, Anton Newcomb and Syd Barrett. Michael Fassbenders performance, although largely a vocal performance due to the constant wearing of a papier mache head is brilliant. His performance is more reliant on vocal and physical expression which he executes with aplomb. Domhnal Gleeson gives a good performance as a character who becomes increasingly unlikeable as the film goes on. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a fine moody and irritable performance as the other song writing genius Clara who is not interested in fame, unlike Jon who has more ambition.<br/><br/>What impressed me most of all is the portrayal of the music involved. I feel it was Directed by someone who understands experimental music and the people behind these crazy sounds. The music itself is very inspired and the performances are also very well executed by the cast. The last performance near the end of the film is nothing short of beautiful, not only for the music, but it's point made about mental illness. It shatters the myth reflected in the character Jon's naivety about how mental illness is synonymous with song writing credibility. In another crucial scene where Jon goes to look for Frank after he has ran away, he finds him at his family home in a place similar to Jon's hometown. This is shown rather subtly by repeating the image of a man spraying his garden and waving at Jon. It happens at the beginning of the film in Jon's hometown, then happens again when he goes to Bluff, Kansas which is Franks hometown. Jon sees through Frank's well kept home and his seemingly level headed parents that he has come from a normal and prosperous background rather than the tormented and dark image of Frank he had in his head. The parents tell him that Frank had always been musical and that his mental illness hindered rather than enhanced his song writing ability.<br/><br/>The message of the head is an interesting one. I think Frank wears the head because there is something inside him which wants people to like him, so he wants to create an iconic image which is positive due to the cartoonish expression. It gives this mystique and eccentric charisma needed which he could not achieve if he did not have a head. As Jon asks 'What goes on inside the head inside that head?' The answer is a combination of many attributes creating one of the most interesting characters and one of the most remarkable films so far this year."

","For the audiences wanting this to be a bio-pic of Frank Sidebottom where his mannerism and characteristics is nailed down to a T will be left disappointed. However if you want to watch a movie that revolve around weird and strange characters and yet intriguing. Or a movie that is influenced by Frank Sidebottom, you just might enjoy this film. This movie sort of reminded me of a more indy version of ""Almost Famous"" except with weirder characters and scenarios. And unlike ""Almost Famous"" the narrator isn't the innocent boy who is looking into what being in a real band is like. But the innocent character is actually Frank the lead singer who is this socially awkward guy that is uncomfortable around many people. To my surprise this movie does have few genuinely funny moments as well and doesn't fall too much into the dark and depressing areas when it comes to the human mind. On the exterior it might seem like a movie about a bunch of hipsters. But it also delves into the pretentiousness of what people may call art and how easily some people can fall into a farse by looking for a deeper meaning. And it also adds modern touches when it comes to the influences of the internet, such as sites like Youtube. The music on the other hand is pretty bad to put is plainly, but the movie is not about the music. But the drive of the characters and what makes them tick. As a matter of fact watching this movie was like watching a group that is part of a psych ward. It's about the narrators self realization by delving into reality and seeing things for what it really is. So although the title says Frank, but the movie is not really about Frank. Frank is more of a concept that the narrator is trying to chase after. Overall this is a in-depth movie that is worth checking out.<br/><br/>8/10"

"maripere95","10","0","1","10 August 2015"," An original quirky story with complex, intriguing characters
","The film manages to walk a thin line of being a comedy about people with mental illnesses without making fun of them. It is a quirky comedy (similar comedic tone as a Wes Anderson film) that explores deeper themes of mental illness, accepting who you are (or aren't) and trying to release your inner creativity. It is completely imaginative and is unlike any other movie, yet it succeeds in remaining simple.<br/><br/>The movie follows Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) an average man attempting to cure his life- long writer's block. He soon meets a group of people witnessing their keyboardist attempting to drown himself in the ocean while being hauled off by the paramedics. This group is being led by none other than Frank (Michael Fassbender), the lead singer who performs and lives his day-to-day life wearing a giant mask. Of course, they are now in need of a new keyboardist and this provides Jon with the perfect opportunity of releasing his creative juices with a group of eccentric ""weirdos."" <br/><br/>That is all you need to know of the plot, even though the movie is not necessarily plot- centred. It isn't even about the quality of the music, but more often than not, you are constantly asking yourself ""is this music actually good?"" or ""can this be considered music?"" or ""what is this sound?"" It is much more of an experience and you eventually find yourself loving it because of the process of its creation. The movie is much more focused on its characters and how Jon learns to accept that he is completely in the ordinary. This is honestly one of my favourite movies, and has gotten better each time that I have watched it. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie more, and it is a shame that it is not more known and appreciated (especially now that the same director has been nominated for an Oscar for his directorial work in the 2015 film, Room). Of course I can accept that it may not be everyone's taste, because it isn't necessarily a ""haha"" funny or a drama either and it is also an indie film, I do hope that more people come to appreciate - and hopefully come to love the artistry that is Frank."

I'd known very little about it but the image of the giant plaster head stuck with me and the buzz was enough to intrigue into a blind-buy when it finally arrived on store shelves. Man, I'm glad I did because I love this movie. It's a bizarre little character-driven tale of aspiring singer/songwriter Jon Burroughs (Domhnall Gleeson) who, when we first meet him, trapped in a dead-end world of office work and a life in suburbia. A chance encounter leads him to a seemingly one-time gig with a small-time band called the Soronprfbs, headed by a mysterious figure that wears a giant plaster head and goes only by the name Frank. The gig is a disaster but the band still needs a new keyboardist (their last tried to drown himself in the ocean), and Frank saw something charming about Jon. Jon is invited to join Soronprfbs as they gather to cut their first album and it's not long before he realizes he's gone off the deep end. The other band members resent him from the start, particularly Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal. Clara is the band's Theremin player and the closest to Frank; she's short-tempered and violent, and Jon is immediately on her bad side. There are dueling ideologies as Jon is determined to find commercial success and the Soronprfbs just want to be themselves, and Frank is caught in the middle.<br/><br/>It would've been cool if the movie had made a point of keeping Frank's identity secret in the promotional materials and left it as a surprise for the movie's finale, but the posters and video cover art prominently advertise the fact that Frank is played by Michael Fassbender. This is, no doubt, my favorite Fassbender performance. Frank is an interesting individual. He wears the head 24/7; shower, sleep, mealsthe head is always on. Working behind the mask meant Fassbender had to give a broad physical performance as well to really bring Frank to life. And then there's the character behind the mask. Frank is unnaturally kind and he's got a talent for pulling music, however bizarre, out of the air. I thought he had a hint of Jim Morrison in his lyrics, with songs that sound as if they could've come from one of Morrison's poems (minus the extreme sexual themes). He's the one person in the band who seems genuinely thrilled to have Jon on board, and it drives Clara insane. Clara sees how Jon's presence is changing the course of the band and she doesn't like it. As the band struggles to put an album together in a remote Irish cabin, Jon is quietly recording video of the strange proceedings and posting them to YouTube to draw an audience and build a fan base. All Frank hears is that Jon has created a legion of fans for the band, but the rest of the crew can see Jon muscling into a place in the spotlight.<br/><br/>As fun as it is seeing Fassbender in action as his coolest character ever, the movie is more about that power struggle. Jon starts of innocent enough. He's just excited to finally have found a band. But he's the type who wants superstardom with legions of screaming fans, whereas the Soronprfbs just want people who dig their music. Or not. Honestly, the only one who seems to care whether people like their music is Frank. But even then, I think he just loves the idea that people ""get"" them. It all comes to a head in Austin, TX when Jon manages to score the band a position at SXSW based on their Internet popularity. It's a fun train wreck to witness as tensions hit their peak and Jon's dream falls apart. But, as interesting as the plight of Soronprfbs is, the best part of the film is the end where we learn who Frank truly is and Jon comes to terms with his own musical core. It's a great reveal and the film's best song closes out the movie. The first song from the band that we get to hear in full, ""I Love You All"" is weird and haunting and, as soon as I heard it, I couldn't get it out of my head. Needless to say, I downloaded it to my phone. I wouldn't be surprised if FRANK becomes a cult classic; Fassbender is a riot, the music gets into your head, and the, if you're like me, you'll want to watch it all again."

","This is a beautiful film. Heartfelt, Gorgeous and all of those synonyms. But where Frank truly shines is the characters relationships. This is a relationship movie that forms connections between each and every character. You like and hate every character for different reasons. Everything is so well set up, in the end you question who you are more like and who you would want to have as a friend or be in your band. <br/><br/>Excellent filming and a bonus for the music. It may fall a little flat in parts but all in all it shines like a crazy experimental electro diamond. Good stuff here, don't miss it."

","An amusing film about an avant-garde rock band who are trying to make an album and become successful. An entertaining satire on many of the pretensions of the music industry but also refers to madness and creativity.<br/><br/>The main character is a young keyboard player who is brought into the band to replace a member who has gone insane. The keyboard player gradually encounters the madness of each band member in turn before finally realising it's not the life for him.<br/><br/>A well made film, probably best appreciated by a 15 to 35 audience.

"lasttimeisaw","6","0","1","10 May 2015"," A gimmicky device of a wrong-notioned way to find success in the music industry
","One major gimmick of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson's music drama-comedy FRANK is its star Michael Fassbender (the ""it"" actor presently) will only appear with a giant paper mask containing his head and never reveal himself in the entire film, but spoiler alert! It turns out that Lenny cannot keep the promise and allow Fassbender's sex appeal (his face to be more accurate) to go untapped and be concealed inside that doll head. So in the last ten minutes, when our eccentric titular protagonist Frank (Fassbender) finally reveals himself without his shield to the outside world, a mixed feeling arises, admittedly Fassbender is my favourite actor among his generation, it is a surprise to see his visage (thanks to the deceptive publicity stunt) in the climax scenes of the film, a pathos-exuding music performance of the song I LOVE YOU ALL, written by the composer Stephen Rednecks. However at the same time, a part of me wishes Lenny Abrahamson could have had the guts to let Frank do the scenes with his mask on, keep the eccentricity running until the last drop.<br/><br/>Jon (Gleeson), a young wannabe musician is audience's proxy in the film, who has by chance been recruited as the new keyboard of the experimental band Soronprfbs, where Frank is the band-leader, and Don (McNair) is the manager, with band-mates Clara (Gyllenhaal), Nana (Azar) and Baraque (Civil). The film is at its best when the whole band is retreated to a remote cabin in Ireland in order to record a new album, Jon is the wide-eyed newcomer tries very hard to blend into the quirky coterie, while others are generally in their wheelhouse to prepare themselves for inspiration and creativity, with occasional financial problem reminds them everything has a due date. Jon covertly records the videos of their daily activities through his twitter account, and Frank's idiosyncrasy (or maybe their unorthodox music) actually generates considerable cyber fandom for the band and they get an invitation to play in the upcoming SWSX festival. <br/><br/>Thus Jon takes it as a springboard for the band to meet a bigger audience, which is unfortunately not in accord with the ideology of other band members, particularly Clara, whose inexplicable hostility towards Jon is invariably present ever since their first eye- contact, it is the essential contradiction between an esoteric artist and a mediocre songwriter, ""mediocre"" is always the original sin for those pretentious artists. Then Frank, apart from his bizarre habits, during the recording session at least, he seems to a normal chap, with clear articulation and occasional humour to mentor other people and give them life guidance. But after a tragic turn (with a comical joke on ashes), Frank and his band is about to play live in USA in front of their potential groupies-to-be, but interior strife plays havoc on their solidarity, eventually the performance (with only Frank and Jon) is a fiasco, and both Jon and audience realise that for sure Frank has a bigger problem than his peculiarity suggests. <br/><br/>The mystery unravels during Jon's visit to Frank's parents when his mask is finally taken off, we are obliged to see Frank as a scarred human being, true to his slow-witted ungainliness. While Jon, the innocuous young man, who wastes all his inherited money from his grandpa on the band, has gotten a stab on the leg and run over by a car, everything he hopes ends up to be a pipe dream just because no one informs him that his way to success is not the right way for Frank, the selfishness of other band members cannot be left without feeling chafing. <br/><br/>That said, Maggie Gyllenhaal's fiery aggressiveness is quite enjoyable to watch, no sympathy needs to be squandered on her and she successfully pulls off a sort of characteristic nonconformism in constant begrudging of die-hard idolatry which she never gets. In any case, the film is too wacky and half-minded to convince us with Frank's talent in this line of business which supposes to have some leverage to reckon on and what every other musician should feel envious of, instead one cannot help but feeling sorry for Jon, I doubt this would be the initial response Lenny Abrahamson had envisioned from his audience in the first place, or as simple as that sometimes attention-grabbing oddity can be easily mistaken as talent, especially in our age, it can happen in a daily basis."

","Frank is a phenomenal movie.

Frank is an artist. A singer. A philosopher. A musician with a marvelous, groundbreaking band to follow his eccentric ways. The Soronpfbs are an outstanding band well worth a listen and a watch. Their intergalactic peak is something to be excited for. Be excited. This is a film for fans of film; wanting to see something new. This is a film for music lovers; before i got the soundtrack, I just tossed the movie on and listened to it. The performances are phenomenal. The reality of it is awe-inspiring. Perfect this movie is not, but its flaws are like those eccentricities you learn to love in your lover. Watch it!!! Campaign for a Soronpfbs tour and Frank 2!

The cast is terrific, all playing characters not like ones they have played previously. This is my first time seeing Domhnall Gleesom in anything, and he is definitely a talented actor, Maggie Gyllenhaal has a strange role that was certainly different for her, and Michael Fassbender shines as this very unique character, there really is no film character quite like Frank, he is hilarious, but you can also really feel for him. It isn't outstanding, but Frank is a fun and quirky film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or drama. <br/><br/>Jon puts his love for music to the test when he joins a very unusual band as they struggle to write new music, lead by a man named Frank who refuses to show his face. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Michael Fassbender Worst Performance: Carla Azar"

","I wasn't quite sure what to expect when going into 'Frank', I remember initially anticipating this film... and suddenly, somewhere along the line, I became sceptical as it started appearing like a pretentious comedy centred around hipsters. However, 'Frank' thankfully turned out to exceed my expectations far more than I would have ever anticipated. I honestly feel a sense of guilt for ever doubting this film, it just proves how a book should never be judged by its cover, or in this case, how a film should not be prejudged due to poor marketing.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the writing in this film is undeniably good; predictability is never an issue as the narrative takes turns left and right constantly. Each character is developed to an appropriate extent; there is never a sense of dwelling on the exploration of these individuals or their respective issues. Instead, everything is simply presented as it is without much context, and personally had me questioning certain characters' motives or actions throughout the film. However, the perfect ending ties everything together, it feels strangely rewarding and certainly proves how well this film is written and directed, as well as of course, acted.<br/><br/>Michael Fassbender, in my opinion, gives an Oscar-worthy performance. I realise this may be a bold statement, but Fassbender delivers everything there is to deliver for an elaborate character such as Frank. Contrary to people's judgement regarding Fassbender's performance relying on physicality due to sporting the giant fake head for almost the entire film; I believe his performance brings far more to the film including terrific voice acting, whilst showcasing familiar traits associated with people such as Frank in an appropriate manner. Domhnall Gleeson and Maggie Gyllenhaal both deliver very good performances, and despite not seeing any other work featuring Gleeson prior to watching this film; I was absolutely enticed in his journey as the supposed protagonist known as Jon. His character is likewise developed to an appropriate extent, being both relatable and simultaneously distasteful at times, and thus all the more realistic and therefore captivating.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can think of is the fact that this film is predominantly marketed as a simple quirky comedy, and just like with films such as 'Sideways' (which is one of my favourite films of all time), it is primarily a drama featuring comedic attributes every so often. 'Frank' does however maintain an overriding sense of quirkiness which thankfully doesn't distract from the plot or the characters, and at times helps the film to maintain on a more light-hearted level; the quirky tone it provides simply makes the film even more entertaining and enjoyable. To conclude, 'Frank' is definitely one-of-a-kind, it is a simply wonderful experience and legitimately makes me upset that it is such an underrated film; it definitely deserves more recognition!"

Frank invites Jon to join them but it turns out to be a much longer stay than he expected as they try to record an album. It seems like only Don (Scoot McNairy) in the band likes the kid.

It has a nice light wackiness about the movie. Domhnall Gleeson is terrific. Fassbender is surprisingly expressive without his face. Gyllenhaal is also very solid.

","Frank stars Domhall Gleeson as a young keyboard player who stumbles his way into an odd pop band led by the mysterious titular lead singer (Michael Fassbender) and comprised of surly, unlikeable, experimental, and talented musicians. It's certainly a different kind of movie, if only because Frank wears an oversized paper-mache costume head - at all times - but the strong cast propels what might have been an indifferent, familiar storyline.<br/><br/>Jon (Gleeson) has an office job by day and attempts to write songs for his keyboard at night. When he witnesses a band's keyboard player attempting to drown himself in the ocean, Jon is, uh, Jonny on the spot - hired immediately as an emergency replacement by the band's manager, Don (Scoot McNairy) for a gig that night. Bear in mind that poor Jon hasn't heard one note of the band's tunes but being able to play the keys using three chords is all he needs to do, and he acquits himself well. But it ain't over, is it? Don later calls Jon up and asks him if he wants to do it again, he agrees - only to discover that the band, instead of gigging, plans to hole up in a cabin in the woods and record an album.<br/><br/>In addition to the puzzling Frank, there's Nana (Carla Azar) on drums and Baraque (Francois Civil) on guitar. Neither seems to like Jon very much, for unknown reasons. But dwarfing them both in that arena is Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who plays synthesizer (including a theremin) and is mercurial and openly antagonistic toward Jon. Perhaps because she views him as attempting to drive a wedge between her and Frank. Perhaps because she is opposed to Frank's notion of making music people will like (and pay for) and intuits that Jon will side with Frank.<br/><br/>No one really seems to know what makes Frank tick. He never takes the mask off. No one in the band has ever seen him without it. He takes his meals by way of a straw (seriously), and speakers and earpieces are built into the sides of his mask/head. He sleeps and showers with the thing on. Yes, it's strange, but no one aside from Jon seems to mind. That's because Frank appears to be a musical genius with a terrific voice and a penchant for writing soulful, evocative music.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal in particular is really excellent as the nasty, spiteful Clara. It's surely not easy to make such a despicable character work, but Gyllenhaal is more than up to the task. And her chemistry with Gleeson and, to a lesser extent, Fassbender, is laser focused. Performances like this remind you just how exceptional an actress Gyllenhaal is. Maybe someday she'll get some true recognition.<br/><br/>Frank isn't your typical musical biopic, real or fictional, and that's one of its best assets. Given the low box office returns ($644,000 in the U.S.), I'd have to consider this one of the more under-appreciated films of 2014. It's funny, honest, and offbeat."

","Frank is a film about being wrong, and that's what's right about it. The plot summary should give you the basic understanding: aspiring UK songwriter/cubicle occupier Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) lucks into a position in a quirky alternative band after the current keyboard player tries to drown himself nearby while Jon sits on a park bench for lunch. <br/><br/>With no introduction to the band, its songs, or even the proper pronunciation of its name, the first gig fails miserably, but for reasons other than Jon. A day or so later, he receives a call from Don, inviting him to be the replacement keyboard player because lead singer Frank found him ""cherishable."" He discovers that Frank is both a genius and a beautiful soul, who wears a disturbing fake head at all times. <br/><br/>Both Frank (Michael Fassbender) and the producer Don (Scoot McNairy) are both sane and completely not, and the analog keyboardist/theremin player Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is the nastiest and nuttiest, the source of much of the band's tension, yet also quite clearly a genius in her own right. The remaining band mates (drummer and guitarist) are a French couple mostly in their own world, but clearly form a foundation for the rest.<br/><br/>It's only the keyboard player that seems to be the wildcard, the band is now on its third in the form of Jon.<br/><br/>All of the performances are great, and the depiction of the process of music creation is lively and frustrating. The plot moves along well, and blends a mix of both funny and sad while still getting its message across.<br/><br/>The Negatives:<br/><br/>Though the band's creative process features a variety of post-industrial composition, the ultimate songs end up being traditionally structured alternative rock songs (though I like them quite a lot.) And again, this is obviously a Twitter funded advertising vehicle, like that one Favreau Eating Movie That Shall Not be Named: standard pop-up on screen tweets with accompanying bird sound effects spattered like pigeon droppings. But unlike that other movie, the Twitter ads are less intrusive upon the story, don't feature stupid scenes like ""Sign me up, son! (*munch* *munch*)"", and show Twitter more for what is: hoping that you can will the wind to rise at your back while you urinate freely away. Plus it leads to the ultimate message of the movie: You Can Only Succeed With Success, and You Can't Change Chemistry With a Carnival.<br/><br/>Compare that to the Apple products, which are barely noticeable (and that's how it should be with advertising-funded movies.) Instrument- wise, I saw both Nord and M-audio keyboards, and the theremin is probably a Moog, but its name isn't displayed. That stuff doesn't bother me, because they don't force your attention upon them.<br/><br/>I would have given this 8 stars for the story, acting, directing, and editing, but I feel it's necessary to take 1 star away for any movie where the advertising is blatant enough to distract me from the story."

It's probably the most obscure one of his career but he transforms himself once again into Frank, this broken down artist who is frightened to ever show his face in front of people so he hides behind a mask 24/7. Domhnall Gleeson also gives another very good performance as the newest member of Frank's band who desperately wants to become popular in the music industry. The band is full of different personalities, who of course don't particularly get along and it ends up creating major conflicts with the goals of Gleesons character. After the band becomes increasingly popular, the films plot takes a few left turns that are a bit far fetched and it almost took me out of the movie. Gyllenhaal gives one of her weaker performances as she comes off as a little bit too annoying to have any sympathy towards her character.<br/><br/>But the stranger the plot gets, the better the performances become.

","Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), a wanna-be musician whose songwriting is crappy at best, joins by chance a weird pop band, quite indie, quite insane. The leader, singer and songwriter is Frank, a charismatic front man who always wears a big fake head. A rather promising story I reckon... There are great actors on board, like Michael Fassbender, Maggie Gyllenhaal or Domnhall Gleeson, but music is the main character here. It is not a musical, it is more how music struggles to be business, or something artistic or even mystic.It is at this point that both Fassbender and Gyllenhaal nail it as tortured but gifted souls that create music, because let's not kid ourselves here, ordinary people don't usually create something like ""OK Computer"" (Radiohead, 1997, EMI Records). Jon begins his own journey from being that normal person to someone that witness that artistic epiphany that we as fans can only enjoy. It is quite a way to describe the process of songwriting ( I will not keep talking about this since I am not a musician), but as far as filmmaking is concerned, this is indie at its best. Dense, compelling and let's say it, hipster, at least aesthetically; it is not that original, nor is it classical, it is more erratic, inspiring even...It seemed to me like those records that leave no impression on that first listening, but that in time tends to become the most appreciated song pieces in your mind."
"rsj624","8","0","1","13 December 2014"," Frank....
","Frank is a testament to everything that both good and bad about music and it's experimental nature. On the one hand its a movie about learning through life and death how music can bring about amazing memories and life experiences. On the other hand it's movie about utter insanity and the cost of ones own well-being just to make a record and spend time with some truly whacked out people. <br/><br/>As someone who has played an instrument in the past, and had friends in bands, and even had my own solo project, it's insulting to a degree to see a movie play up how true creativity and amazing music comes from places deep within or from people who have some sort of mental illness/overwhelming life problems. <br/><br/>To be fair to the movie however, perhaps making it about the opposite wouldn't have made it as interesting or dramatic, but some people just have a gift for music and don't need to be disturbed to send a great message; and while the film tries to forward our understand of Fassbender's character actually being limited by his own inherent mental illness rather than gifted by it, the band on a whole still comes off as pretentious and difficult, and Frank is about the only truly likable character in the film.<br/><br/>I know the film is not trying to be insulting, but given the limited amount of music based movies out there, it would be nice to see one that doesn't use insanity, drugs, or bad life experiences as the reasons most great music has been written. <br/><br/>Aside from those complains, what the movie does get right is in its unfolding of said dramas. It's so crazy that it's entertaining enough just to see if everyone is actually going to make it out of the movie in one piece. <br/><br/>Frank is not the easiest movie to speak of, given it's perhaps best watched to truly understand, and while I feel this review is more of a generalization of how easy it is to both love and hate it, perhaps that's it's genius. <br/><br/>If you don't finish watching this movie and have some mixed feelings about it, then I don't think it's done it's job. Frank is so deep in both it's simplicity and complexity that its somehow equally easy and hard to recommend, and that should give you every reason to watch it; music fan or not."
"StevePulaski","7","0","1","10 December 2014"," A film that should be character-centered, but gets by on true moments of companionship and emotions
","Lenny Abrahamson's Frank concerns Jon (Domhnall Gleeson), an aspiring singer-songwriter who has a head full of ideas but no conception of how to execute them. One day, he witnesses a man trying to drown himself at a beach before being rushed to the hospital. Jon is informed by Don (Scoot McNairy) that the man was a keyboardist for an experimental, new-age band by the name of The Soronprbs, which he manages. Learning that Jon plays keyboards, Don signs him to perform for the band one night, much to the dismay of everyone in the band except for the band's leader, a mysterious, enigmatic soul who wears an oversized, paper-mâché detailed to look like a cartoonish face and goes by ""Frank"" (Michael Fassbender). When Frank signs Jon to be a full-time band member, Jon becomes the bane of Clara's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) existence, as she, the band's theremin-player, becomes increasingly jealous of the relationship that Frank and Jon have with one another.<br/><br/>Jon sees Frank in a different light than everyone else. Rather than viewing him as some larger-than-life figure, he sees past his large mask and tries to cut into him deep as a person. Clearly, Frank has unresolved and deep-rooted mental issues, and the members of The Soronprbs often tell Jon in private to recognize these and go along with his behavior naturally. Jon, however, needs no schooling in how to handle Frank; there's an instant connection between the two and it's one that Clara or anyone else in the band couldn't provide him, which is undoubtedly what Frank saw the second he met Jon.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful theme of companionship and connection rooted in Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan's screenplay, and it's not one rooted in fabricated answers or cheap, gift-wrapped justifications. It's a connection that exists and simply is, withstanding clear differences and wavelengths in the best possible way. Part of Frank's success is the way Fassbender portrays his character, in a way that shows he's a man of actions and feelings.<br/><br/>Frank's biggest issue, however, is the way Ronson and Straughan write the film's characters. Undoubtedly, Frank is the most intriguing person in the film for more reasons than just his large, unique skull, but this is only more apparent when the supporting characters are just not written as eloquently or as interestingly as the titular one. The remaining characters in the film, and even their performances to some degree, carry a weighty coldness in a manner that makes it difficult to understand the motivations of the characters and, in turn, side with them. The film itself doesn't lack personality, but its characters leave a lot more to be desired than what we expect, given the film has such an intriguing premise.<br/><br/>Abrahamson has made a film that is contemplative in themes and focus, but not one that looks at character enough. It mistakes moments of silence and long, awkward pauses between sentences as contemplative drama, when Frank is a film that should have character-centeredness written all over it. However, despite all this, the film manages to have real moments of emotional honesty and remains an enjoyable film on the basis it takes a quirky, and somewhat subversive idea, and runs with it to the point where something, be it strange emotions or even mixed ones, resonates.<br/><br/>Starring: Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Scoot McNairy. Directed by: Lenny Abrahamson."
"MattBrady099","6","0","1","5 December 2014"," The weird and the wonderful
","This has to be the most oddest, touching and funniest movie that I have seen this year. <br/><br/>The movie is about a keyboardist looking for his big break joins an eclectic pop band fronted by the mysterious Frank - the lead-singer who never removes his paper mâché head. <br/><br/>This is by far my favorite movie of 2014. The acting in the movie was freaking fantastic, the writing was well written and it was new and refreshing, not like other movie these days. The main character of the film Frank played by Michael Fassbender, and I have to say frank is the most interesting character in this whole film. The other characters in the film are interesting to but I think frank is most interesting to me.<br/><br/>A movie that is new and refreshing, not like other movie these days"
"cosmo_tiger","6","0","3","5 November 2014"," Really nothing more than a generic music movie that has been done a million times...but this one has a singer with a giant fake head.
","""I will show them what I'm capable of. I will show them."" Jon Burroughs (Gleeson) is a struggling wanna be musician who is drifting aimlessly through life. When he happens on a band that needs a keyboardist he gladly fills in. He is surprised when he sees Frank (Fassbender) the lead singer who always wears a fake head. Little by little Jon starts to become more assertive with the music but this causes strain with the band and the eccentric Frank. I have been writing these little reviews for about 3 years now. I average about 7-8 a week and most of the time they come easy to me. Rarely am I at a loss as to what to say. This is one of those times. There are some movies that are good, some that are bad and some that are just so bizarre you aren't sure what to think. The last few that I saw that come to mind are Rubber (the movie about the killer tire) and Congress (the new Robin Wright movie). This is really nothing more than just a generic music movie that has been done a million times...but this one has a singer with a giant fake head. It is not something anyone dwells on and is really just accepted that that is how he is. Overall, I did like this OK but this is not a movie for everyone. I give it a B-."
"851222","8","0","1","2 November 2014"," Bizarre and entertaining movie
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Frank"" (2014) is kinda unique movie, it has great feel - bizarre, bold, darkly funny - if you like this stuff, you will definitely enjoy ""Frank"". Acting is good, but nothing outstanding - the script in here is what makes ""Frank"" unique as well as very solid directing and nice pacing. Don't take this movie serious, really, because if turn it on to watch some good drama with comedy elements, it can be very hard to watch experience. But if you are in the mood for some bold and funny flick, ""Frank"" is not to be missed.<br/><br/>Overall, in the traditions of good alternative music album, ""Frank"" delivers - don't expect to be blown away, and it will may surprise you."
"regkeane","7","0","1","2 November 2014"," Strangle compelling.
","This movie is never going to be a blockbuster but the people who made it know that. It could easily be a cult movie though.<br/><br/>The movie begins in a damp northern English seaside town. A dour depressing poor look and feel. It then moves to the Irish countryside, a wonderfully green forested dilapidated huddle of shacks in the middle of nowhere. A very nice contrast. Then finally the movie moves to the arid South West of the US. Always in run down depressed dingy bars. The scenarios and cinematography is superb.<br/><br/>The actors all played their parts well. A special mention has to be made for Fassbender though. He was superb. He has great screen charisma. He reminds me of Daniel Day Louis. The one criticism I have of Fassbender (and it is a very small one) is that his Irish accent comes through several times in the movie. He is supposed to be American.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is the part where Fassbender sings the song with the words ""...Fiddly digits Itchy Britches...I love you all"". They could have released that song. It would have made them money."
"brchthethird","8","0","1","29 October 2014"," A quirky combination of indie music and mental illness
","I wasn't sure what to expect from FRANK, although the trailers I saw for it definitely piqued my interest with what seemed to be a quirky, fish-out-of-water story. For what it's worth, that is what the film is initially. However, and I'll be as vague as possible to avoid spoiling anything, it ends up being a potent examination of mental illness that was quite touching. Domnhall Gleeson plays Jon, an aspiring musician who joins a band led by a mysterious man, Frank (Michael Fassbender), who always wears a giant papier-mache head over his own. Together, they journey out into the country to record an album and, eventually (due to Jon's constant stream of social media information) go to Texas to play SXSW. While that might describe the skeleton of the plot, what really makes this worth watching is the idiosyncrasies and quirks of the main characters, their humorous interactions and antics, and Jon's desperate attempt to make himself feel like a part of the group. You really get a sense of him as an outsider, although the people he surrounds himself with are probably even more societal outsiders than he is. The music they make isn't mainstream by any means. In fact, it's completely removed from that: it comes from the soul. I didn't particularly care for a lot of it, since it came off sometimes as being weird for weird's sake, but the conviction with which it is played and the enthusiasm of the band playing it makes it tolerable, even endearing. Everyone gives an excellent performance, especially Michael Fassbender who is able to make his character work despite having his head covered for most of the movie. Domnhall Gleeson is good too, but I would like to give special mention to Maggie Gyllenhaal. She was hilariously weird in parts, and other times deadly serious, but overall you got a good sense that she cared for Frank. Scoot McNairy also has a small-ish role, and he was decent as well. Overall, I like this film a lot despite not caring for the music in it. This is one of the best films I've seen this year and I would highly recommend others to see it as well."
"jboothmillard","7","0","1","23 October 2014"," Frank
","I saw the poster and I recognised the iconic image of the man wearing a large round head with black hair and big blue eyes, possibly from somewhere in childhood, so I was most interested to see a film where this was the big draw. Basically Jon Burroughs (About Time's Domhnall Gleeson, Brendan's son) is a young man is a wannabe musician, he wants to get into the music industry, but struggles a little to write his own original material on his keyboard. He gets lucky with a band needing a replacement keyboard player, playing a few chords, this eccentric band is called ""Soronprfbs"", led by the mysterious and enigmatic Frank (Michael Fassbender), Frank is always seen wearing his trademark large papier-mâché spheroidal head, and he never takes it off, even to eat, drink, wash or sleep. Jon joins the band as they travel to Ireland to rehearse and find their unique sound to record a new album, Jon posts many comments on Twitter and videos on the internet of his experiences, the band's rehearsal sessions and his thoughts and feelings, and eventually he does find himself able to compose new music on the keyboard, but Frank does not use this material, he takes elements of it to create the music he wants for the band. The band finally start recording an album, but tension emerges between members, not just with Jon who feels somewhat shunned with his original music, but also with often aggressive theremin player Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who loves Frank, but the relationship is hard while he wears his head all the time. Towards the end, despite a following on social media, Jon finally loses his way and drops out of the band, and Frank is hit by a car which ruins the large head he wears, Frank reveals his true face to his band members in a bar, with Jon returning to look onwards, slowly Frank starts to sing and the band play along, they seem to reconcile, while Jon smiles and eventually walks away to find his own path in life. Also starring Scoot McNairy as band manager Don, Carla Azar as band drummer Nana, François Civil as French bassist Baraque, Lauren Poole as Alice, Hayley Derryberry as Simone, Paul Butterworth as Jon's Father, Moira Brooker as Jon's Mother, Tess Harper as Frank's Mom, Bruce McIntosh as Frank's Dad and Mark Huberman as Management Guru. Gleeson gives a finely tunes performance as the young musician falling into a nutty gang, Gyllenhaal is interesting as she snarls and is mostly antisocial, and unseen throughout most of the film Fassbender is fascinating as the title character expressing himself through bodily expressionism, words and of course music. The story is inspired by the experiences of writer Jon Ronson, the real keyboardist of the band, the real Frank was cult entertainer Frank Sidebottom, the creation of musician and comic Chris Sievey (who died in 2010), the story is not a biopic or biographical, it takes the large papier-mâché spheroidal head as a starting point and creates a fictional full of suitably understated laughs and alternative art, the songs are most interesting throughout as well, especially the final song ""I Love You All"" sung by both Fassbender and The Soronprfbs, this is a most watchable comedy drama. Very good!"
"akash_sebastian","7","0","1","16 October 2014"," A Truly Original and Uplifting Film on Music, or Art in general.
","Lenny Abrahamson's quirky and offbeat comedy-drama 'Frank' is a delightful study of artists and their influences. The story is essentially about self-discovery, finding inspiration in the nature (environment) around, finding the unique form of art that comes from within us. It also shows how people quite often get influenced by public opinion and get pressured to modify their art to cater to the masses, and end up losing their charm; it might bring in fame and money for a while, but making the art one wants is much more satisfying in the long run.<br/><br/>All the characters are quite fascinating and amusing, especially the enigmatic and free-spirited Frank and the hilariously hot-tempered Clara, played by Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal respectively.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with many amusing, heart-warming, and inspiring moments. I don't want to completely spoil much, so I'll just say, I really loved the song Frank sings in the last scene; catchy rhythm, hilarious lyrics, and really heartfelt.<br/><br/>A truly original and uplifting film on music, or art in general."
"Myusersnameiscoolokay","9","0","1","16 October 2014"," It's not a feel-good flick, but is a guaranteed must-see.
","Frank (2014) follows Jon Burroughs, a wannabe musician on a quest to put behind his humdrum office job to become the new keyboard player to an eccentric and downright crazy (literally) music band. Jon (played by Domhnall Gleeson) attempts to find musical inspiration, failing to find some within we see him resorting to walking down the street and writing unimaginative lyrics about women holding grocery bags. His life is boring, and he believes himself to be unremarkable. <br/><br/>We've seen it done before. Protagonist meets person(s) with unconventional world views or eccentric characteristics, whom impact their lives in some meaningful way. Jon Ronson (one of the co- screenplay writers) loosely based the film's story on the musician Chris Sevey's comic persona, Frank Sidebottom. With the ingenuity of the director (Lenny Abrahamson), it carefully avoids the trite convention by providing genuine dialog, dimensional characters and real-world consequences.<br/><br/>The title character, Frank (Michael Fassbender) whose unrelenting need to wear a disproportionately large cartoon head is both intriguing and worrisome. Michael Fassbender shines as Frank. Limited to talking wearing that gigantic head, stating his facial expressions and communicating through body movements, he is the star (and rightly so). Honourable mention to Maggie Gyllenhaal (who portrays Clara, the feisty and quirky antagonist). The film preaches, without being preachy. Musical talent is hindered by mental illness, not the cause of it. Social media popularity does not equate to real life popularity. Some people will put their self-interests ahead of your health. It somewhat spouts Lars Von Trier's mantra, that people are selfish and generally horrid, while giving them redeeming qualities. This film is more than what it seems."
"crijon","8","0","1","15 October 2014"," I want more of funny Fassbender
","Michael Fassbender deserves to be a household name like Brad Pitt or George Clooney, I think he's more talented than both of those guys. His turn as the eccentric title character in Frank is something unexpected and out of left field. Sometimes the best gifts are the ones we don't expect.<br/><br/>Frank on its base level is a comedy, but to call it just a comedy would be an injustice. This film speaks volumes about the creative process and the struggle that is involved. Domhnall Gleeson of About Time fame is the real main character that we follow throughout this film. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Scoot McNairy have great supporting roles as well.<br/><br/>I must mention the head that Fassbender wears throughout the movie, it's hilarious at times and creepy at others. It just adds to the mythic figure that is Frank. He is filled with this overwhelming sense of optimism. More than just the leader of the band, he's a friend to many. They don't really give much back story to the band, but there is a sense that Frank has impacted his bandmates lives in a very profound way.<br/><br/>The story flows pretty well but has a short lull in the 2nd act. I wanted a bit more back story into the characters, but this is a film that isn't very heavy on plot. The music in the film, much like the film itself, is not for everybody but I found it to be pretty catchy. The energy that Fassbender puts into the performance is reason enough to watch. The song he sings at the end is so sweet and hilarious, it put a nice ribbon on things.<br/><br/>I could see this being a very polarizing film if it hits a wide audience. It's not a quirky, laugh out loud comedy like the trailer would suggest. It has comedic beats here and there, but I thought of it more as an offbeat dramedy. I was looking forward to seeing this film and I don't know that it necessarily delivered on everything that I was expecting, but at the same time it's transfixing and entertaining beyond words."
"Gordon-11","Null","0","1","5 October 2014"," Eccentric and different from the rest
","This film tells the story of a young man who gives up his career to join an eccentric rock band that features the lead vocalist who wears a fake head all the time.<br/><br/>""Frank"" has a weird plot, and it is so weird that I don't really understand it. The characters are all strange in their own ways, while Domhnall Gleeson''s character, called Jon, seems to be the only one who can be related to in daily life. All the other character's actions are seemingly inexplicable, such as Clara's sudden outburst of violence in the alleyway, or Don wearing the fake head to do his final act. I didn't understand why a German family shows up in the cottage either. The story is a big confusion for me, but it is still interesting to watch because of its eccentricity and unpredictability."
"pivic","7","0","1","22 September 2014"," Lovely and sad
","This is a funny and sad film that uses the main character, Jon, a boy who's grown up in a little town and dreams of escape, as a kind of rock while quasi-chaos reigns around him, mainly as controlled by Frank, the leader of a band that is beyond the experimental.<br/><br/>This film, for me, displays what happens when you're really not being true to yourself, when you're mainly trying to cater to others without a care for what you truly believe in, and when you really don't care about the opinions of those that should be close to you.<br/><br/>Interesting soundtrack, well directed, acted and written, this is a simple, lovely indie film that deserves attention."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","0","5","2 September 2014"," Bewildering ludicrosity
","Sweeping the independent film circuit this year, Frank is befittingly many levels of nutty.<br/><br/>The titular character, Frank, is the lead singer in a below underground experimental music group and always wears a papier-mâchéd head sculpture the size of a watermelon.<br/><br/>Jon is a hopelessly average and unimpressive aspiring musical artist who might as well not even exist, except to his 14 twitter and tumblr followers. Jon joins Frank's eccentric band Soronprfbs when their keyboardist tries to drown himself. He joins the band at the pivotal moment when they decide to record their album in solitude in the woods of Ireland. The capricious plot unfolds while Jon is chronicling his endeavors on social media during the harsh conditions and volatile exchanges with the band members.<br/><br/>The bandmates are whimsically bizarre and captivating. Clare is Frank's creative and emotional soul mate and facilitating translator. She is also threatening, combative and violent. Scoot McNairy plays Don, a creatively insecure man, to the point of inadequacy, stifled by Frank's genius. Then there is the prodigiously and lyrically brilliant lead singer Frank whose eccentricity is unparalleled and whose actor is marvelous.<br/><br/>At first Frank seems like an examination of the character and its development through life's banalities typical of an indie film. Quickly Frank morphs into an exceedingly weird and dark comedy reminiscent of a conceptual art piece. The type of art that if one attempts to analyze the resulting description is contrived, superficial and inexact.<br/><br/>Frank is a ludicrous journey without reason. I am not sure what I experienced besides the detailed events I watched and don't particularly know what the director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwriters Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan were going for. But I am glad I watched this aberrant film and indie film fans especially should take a look.<br/><br/>More reviews can be found at our website."
