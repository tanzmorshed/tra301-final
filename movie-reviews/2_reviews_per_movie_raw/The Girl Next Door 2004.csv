","In a world wrought with unoriginal and humor-lacking teen movies, The Girl Next Door provides a beacon of light. The director's hardest battle was to insure that although 90% of the cast are teenagers, that this movie should not be labeled as a teen comedy.<br/><br/>The first comparison that should be made between your average Hollywood teen offering and this movie is the humor. Some movies (American Pie 1, Road Trip) are genuinely funny, but in a slapstick way. The Girl Next Door provides more intelligent jokes (Eli saying that Matthews's motel advances towards Danielle was a little forthcoming, for instance).<br/><br/>Even after this fact is acknowledged, it is still tempting to accuse The Girl Next Door of being a teen movie, but suddenly the thought springs to mind. ""Hang on; did that movie have a story line?"" And the answer is of course ""too right it did"". The story line revolves around a life changing loss of innocence for: primarily, Matthew and Danielle, and secondarily: Eli and Klits.<br/><br/>Matthew starts the movie in a tether of his scholarship acquirement's, he spends hours studying and speech revising. enter Danielle, in the space of 2 weeks she turns Matthew from a text book geek, into the king of the school (I refer of course to his control over the jocks on prom night.). Danielle, for all her real world experience, is an emotional black hole. Matthew, in the movie breaks threw this, and Danielle ""makes love"" for the first time.<br/><br/>Eli, the local porn king, thinks he (sexually) knows it all, however, even the slightest sexual conduct, and he turns and runs (i.e. the porn star asking Eli/Klitz to feel his girlfriends breasts). Klitz, like Matthew, is a text book nerd and lacks any confidence in his appearance, what so ever. With the help of April, he breaks through this, gaining a silent reputation for the prominence of his manhood.<br/><br/>So let's compare these major story lines to some admitted teen movies. American Pie 2: The story line (singular) in this story is to go on vacation and get laid. WOW. Not exactly a feast for the thought. Road Trip: This time round the storyline (singular) is that a guy suddenly realizes that his pen pal is a girl and sets of on a several thousand mile trip to profess his undying love.. Rubbish.<br/><br/>One similarity I am happy to point out between this work and the self-proclaimed teen movies, is that it has an excellent sound track. A few examples of the excellent choices in music would be David Gray's This Years Loving. This song perfectly matched the budding affections of Danielle and Matthew, both while they share their first kiss, and when there have sex for the first time. On a smaller scale Lapdance by NERD, perfectly captures the moment when the new and improved Matthew, strolls into the Prom and officially becomes the Godfather of the school. On the topic of the sound track, I could go on for pages, so ill just stop that now.<br/><br/>The best movie to compare this piece to is Risky Business. You've all seen it I'm sure. The academically perfect Tom Cruise's parents do away for the weekend. And Cruise erupts. Going wild for the weekend, he dance around the house, pants-less (easily one of the most famous scenes in movie history) and more importantly (from a story line point of view), meets and falls in love with hooker Lana (Rebecca De Mornay). On comparison I preferred The Girl Next Door. The relationship between Hirsh/Cuthbert is far more convincing then that of Cruise/De Mornay, and more importantly, there was no real foundation for the change in Cruises character, whereas Matthew is forced out of his shell by the life-of-fun character of Danielle.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Risky Business is unshakable from it pillar as one of the best movies ever. But the Girl Next Door deserves to stand right up there beside is it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie but have read this. sorry., but go get the movie anyway, trust me, i didn't talk about, about 90% of the content of this masterpiece. If you have seen it, then I hope you agree with my synopsis.<br/><br/>This movie is worthy of much more recognition then it is currently receiving. And ill bet that the reason is in the first eleven words of this review."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","167","198","3 March 2006"," marketing is deceiving...one of the sweetest movies in years
","The Girl Next Door's tagline ""Matt didn't see her coming...but all his friends have!"" is very deceiving, because the movie is not like that at all. When you see this, you'll expect a raunchy, borderline porn movie, but what you get is a refreshing, adorable, and sweet love story with great performances from Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert.<br/><br/>Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch, The Emperor's Club, Lords of Dogtown) is not a geek by any means. He's your everyday nice guy who's never really 'lived'. He is the top student, the class president, and he's in charge of bringing a teenage super genius to the U.S.A. Everything is going fantastic, because he even gets accepted to Georgetown. Only problem is, he needs the money to get to the school, and this can only be paid by winning a scholarship. A few days before his speech on why he deserves the scholarship, Matt meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, '24', Weezer's 'Perfect Situation video), a breathtakingly beautiful girl who (after a hilarious few scenes where they meet) he instantly falls for, and she falls for him.<br/><br/>For the first part of the movie, you see Danielle, the near unfairly sexy girl, push Matt to limits he hasn't gone to, such as running in the street naked, swimming in a stranger's pool, and skipping school. They're falling in love, and it's easy to see on screen, and it's adorable.<br/><br/>Just when it can't get any better for Matt, things take a turn for the worse. One of his best friends, Eli (the hilarious Chris Marquette), who is a massive porn addict, goes through his collection, and finds a tape...and who is the star? Danielle. Turns out, Danielle had just quit her job as a porn star and decided to turn over a new leaf. After a near tear-jerking scene, Danielle returns to her old career by contacting her old boss, a gritty and suave porn producer named Kelly (Tim Olyphant). It's at this point that Matt decides that he doesn't care about Danielle's past, and he's in love with her. He decides that he'll do anything to get her back, including taking on Kelly, the porn industry, and some very weird people.<br/><br/>After some events, the plot strays away from just Matt and Danielle, and thickens to become a real movie, not just a teen movie. The movie does an excellent job of keeping us interested, because just as the plot becomes serious, Eli and Matt's other friend, Klitz, add some very funny moments and ideas. Yes, the movie does sound like the classic Risky Business, but it does things that separate itself from that movie. The chemistry between Hirsch and Cuthbert is magical, and despite her gigantic sex appeal, the character of Danielle is so lovable for how sweet and caring she is to Matt. There are some great plot twists that keep you interested, not to mention hilarious in jokes and one liners, and not to mention a classic quote: ""The juice was worth the squeeze"". You'll understand. Tim Olyphant is great in a somewhat opposing role, and veteran actor James Remar makes a few appearances as a porn producing giant. The movie's ending is so great and funny that you can't help but enjoy, not to mention mysterious, keeping you hanging by a thread the whole way through.<br/><br/>Luke Greenfield has directed a movie that is so well liked and cherished, that I have never heard a bad thing against this film (I'm 17, and all my friends, guys and girls, loved it). I own it on DVD, and have watched it at least 10 times. I've finally gotten around to writing a review, because writing this has reminded me of how great this movie is. In a few one word sentences, The Girl Next Door is...fun. hilarious. sweet. lovable. classic. I recommend this movie to anyone from the ages of 13 to 30, because this is the age group it is intended for."
"MikieMD","8","195","233","3 February 2004"," Strange but appealing
","The Girl Next Door is just simply an entertaining movie.  It's got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while.  Emile Hirsh (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Emperor's Club) is the central character Matthew, about to graduate from high school.  He's just plain likable.  The drop-dead gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert (Kim Bauer on 24, in a very different type of role here) is the title character, Danielle.  Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny.  Funny, a bit silly, and at times honestly sweet, it's an entertaining movie that's harmless and worth seeing."
"Victor Field","Null","251","304","23 April 2004"," The sweetest R-rated (or 15 certificate) movie in recent memory.
","Responsibility for ""The Girl Next Door""'s poor performance at the US box office - as well as over here - can be laid firmly at the feet of Twentieth Century Fox's marketing people; the tagline ""Matt never saw her coming - but all his friends had!"" made it seem like a full-on sex comedy, when it's actually a lot more than that; director Luke Greenfield and writers Stuart Blumberg, David T. Wagner and Brent Goldberg put more emphasis on the characters than the raunch, which makes all the difference. There's more to the movie than the sight of Elisha Cuthbert in a thong (in interviews she revealed that it is indeed her there... if not elsewhere in the movie).<br/><br/>The debt this movie owes to ""Risky Business"" - starting with the score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger (Tangerine Dream scored ""Risky Business"") - is pretty clear; both movies have bright but slightly life-challenged graduate students given to fantasising about things that go wrong as their main characters (step forward Emile Hirsch as the sympathetic hero), both have sex-obsessed best friends, both have women in the sex business as the main female characters who come into the hero's uptight life and help to liberate him, and both have sleazy male bosses (Timothy Olyphant plays the Guido equivalent). The movie also has the same mostly restrained view of its story where other movies would have played up the farce aspects - the only real hi-jinks come when the movie's plot takes in the Adult Film Convention in Las Vegas - but ""The Girl Next Door"" is a lot more engaging and has a lot more heart than ""Risky Business"" (good though that movie is, charm is not its strong point), with the title character seen as more of a person than a masturbatory object both by our hero and by the movie. When she goes with a motel with him and starts to play up The Porn Star, you really hope they don't go through with it.<br/><br/>The mood set up in the early stages is so convincing that when Olyphant's porn producer character turns up the movie seems to turn into another one entirely (and if you go to see this because of Elisha's ""one for the men"" status, I must warn you that she spends alarming amounts of time off-screen); it's still a good one, but it damages the overall movie's tone, and for most of the rest of the movie it veers back and forth between sweet and sleazy... but the amazing thing is that ""The Girl Next Door"" actually manages to find a happy balance of the two by the time the prom climax arrives (with more echoes of ""Risky Business"" en route, for sure).<br/><br/>True, there's no actual sex seen and little nudity, but the cast works so well and the movie's so sincere that by the end it doesn't seem like a ripoff. With good use of songs blending with the score, well-done fantasy sequences, and a welcome dose of intelligence in its writing, ""The Girl Next Door"" is probably the most adorable movie to get an R rating since ""Pretty Woman,"" and well worth seeing even if you don't have a thing for Kim off ""24."" But this isn't for the ""Daily Sport"" crowd. Which is their loss.<br/><br/>""The juice was worth the squeeze."""
"Rogue-32","10","291","354","20 April 2004"," The juice is definitely worth the squeeze
","Here we have a great example of how decent writers, armed with creative juice to spare, can take a well-worn plot and rework it to make it seem fresh.  Just when you think you've got the next twist figured out, you're surprised.  This happens throughout the movie, making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming, smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time - beautifully written, perfectly cast, a real pleasure from start to finish.  <br/><br/>Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant shine in their respective roles as the young man at a crossroads in his life, the girl next door of the title, equally confused, and the scuzball with a heart who knows he has to do the right thing even if it goes against his 'business instincts.' These characters are not one-dimensional, thanks to the superb writing, nor are they caricatures; they come across as genuine individuals, and the comedy in the film comes not at their expense but rather organically, as part of their journey. As Olyphant's character asks Hirsch at one point: ""Is the juice worth the squeeze?"" In this case, it most definitely is."
"arthurmauk","10","126","152","5 January 2006"," Just Go With It
","The Girl Next Door isn't a riotous, laugh-out-loud comedy, à la American Pie or Road Trip (don't get me wrong, I think they are fine movies of a different genre), nor should it be treated as such when being reviewed. It's much more mature, a sweet delight of a story that has you chuckling in amusement rather than rolling on the floor guffawing. For that, I would hardly even classify it in the generic 'comedy' genre. I must admit, I did go in thinking that I'd spend two hours of my life enjoying yet another teen comedy, with an overdone plot, jokes bordering on distasteful, and up to the brim with gratuitous nudity. However, I came out with so much more.<br/><br/>It's a classic tale of boy-meets-girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy lives happily ever after with girl. But what makes The Girl Next Door stand out from the rest is the superb cast. The casting director did a great job, placing Emile Hirsch opposite Elisha Cuthbert (both very talented young up-and-coming actors, I wish them well in luck, love and life). The pair's on-screen chemistry is undeniably electric. They portrayed Matthew and Danielle's relationship perfectly  loving and tender, yet fragile. This boy has fallen hopelessly in love for the first time, with the girl of his dreams. He has no past experience to draw on, he's terrified and confused, and he doesn't know what to do! As director Luke Greenfield pointed out in his commentary (Unrated DVD is a must-have for the hardcore fans), Emile and Elisha were chosen for their ability to act without dialogue, simply with their eyes. The subtleties in each expression brings so much more to the characters when watched closely in detail  every nervous bite of the lip, every slight mischievous arch in the eyebrow  you can tell exactly what they're thinking. Now, I've seen my fair share of movies/TV shows, and I'd be confident in saying that I have not yet seen another actor/actress able to fill those roles as perfectly and effortlessly as Emile and Elisha did. They must've poured their hearts out into these characters, bringing them to life, their romance blossoming on-screen.<br/><br/>And how can we ignore the superb supporting cast? Timothy Olyphant and Chris Marquette's work on this movie was simply priceless. They provided the comedy and laughs, and it would be impossible to list all of their hilarious one-liners here. A lot of people claim that they made the movie, and though I disagree, I can sure see where they're coming from.<br/><br/>And the music, oh, the music. I came of no great surprise to me to learn that Luke Greenfield writes all his projects to music. It is this unique trait that embellishes the movie with such a vivid background. From Bowie & Queen's ""Under Pressure"" opening montage to The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" closing credits, every single song is perfect for its scene, particularly David Gray's ""This Year's Love"", mine and many other's favourite song in the soundtrack. It kicks in at the exact right moment and manages to capture everything about this innocent, pure, high school romance. Also, Paul Haslinger (second to none at composing scores) wrote some of his best work for The Girl Next Door. Simply put (again, stealing lines from the director) Haslinger is deadly with a piano. Each score enhances and fills the moment with such tension and suspense, most notably ""Peeping Matt"", when Matthew watches this gorgeous creature undressing through his window for the first time. There is an element of voyeurism and the excitement of the danger of being caught, as he watches the female movement and form unravelling with fascination and awe. He simply can't keep his eyes off her. It's a scene that many of us can connect with.<br/><br/>This is indeed one of those movies that ought to be watched on a DVD, at night, alone, rather than on a huge screen in the cinema with others. You'll find yourself leaving the end with a bittersweet aftertaste  will I find that special someone like Danielle? Do I need to be broken out of my shell? Is the juice worth the squeeze? Sure, it is an idealist fantasy, but it's also sweet, endearing and full of heart. It's how an old-school love story ought be done. Just suspend your belief for two hours, and watch the magic happen. Hell, just go with it."
"mullermike","9","129","158","13 February 2005"," Kind of a homage to Risky Business but much more than that
","I did not see this movie in theaters. I usually wait for teen films to come out on video before viewing them. I must say, the way this movie was marketed, one would figure that this flick is along the lines of such classics as Bring It On and Can't Hardly Wait. Though this movie definitely is now part of the illustrious teen film library, it runs a little bit deeper than the average adolescent flick.<br/><br/>As the title suggest, this movie does have Risky Business written all over it. The characters (the pimp vs the adult film director) the props (glass egg vs the golden ""trophy"") as well as the music and language definitely give this film an updated twist on RB. However, it would be erroneous to write this film off as a rip-off, it just isn't afraid to show it's influence.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch is great as Matthew Kidman, the ambitious high school senior (who actually looks like he's in high school) with an Ivy League future. Straight and narrow, his life is spun on it's head once Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) enters the picture. Cuthbert, playing a free-spirited porn star, actually gives a rather understated performance that is sincere and sweet. Matthew's once planned out life is now lived more on the edge, and with that, he encounters some interesting characters, such as Kelly, the shady porn director, played flawlessly by Timothy Olyphant.<br/><br/>However, as the film progresses, the movie didn't delve as deeply into Cuthbert's character as it should have. No insight into her background, how did she get to where she is right now, etc. She also takes a back seat to the growing tension between the Matthew and the sleazebag Kelly. I must say, Olyphant is great in this film. He goes from being hilarious to charming to scary in the span of about five minutes and steals almost every scene he's in. The other supporting characters are great. Chris Marquette (Eli) and Paul Dano (Klitz) are funny as Hirsch's dorky friends, and hopefully Marquette will land more roles like this. They too seem to become more adventurous once Danielle enters the picture, what an influence one person can have.<br/><br/>So in the end, this does have a lot of the typical teen flick campiness. There are jocks, hot chicks on campus, geeks, and the movie itself has plenty of swearing, bathroom humor, slapstick, you name it. There is a sweetness to the movie, as it's amazing what a person will do when they fall in love. This movie has plenty of twists and turns, so come along for the ride and have some fun."
"gregsrants","7","150","190","11 April 2004"," Reminds me of what teen films used to be
","Oh, to a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert.  Not that my neighbors are bad. Want a cup of sugar?  Just knock.  Want help will the ball cock in your toilet?  Ring next door.  All of this is incredibly beneficial, but oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!<br/><br/>Elisha plays the 'girl' in the new teen film The Girl Next Door directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal).  Her name is Danielle and she arrives just when neighbor Mathew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is writing a speech in hopes of getting a scholarship for his portrayal of moral fiber.  But one look at the stripping Danielle from his bedroom window to hers leaves every fiber pointing in a different direction.<br/><br/>This small act of voyeurism leads to all sorts of trouble as Danielle notices her admirers' gazing and immediately heads next door to confront young Matthew.  The result of their new courtship would lead to public nudity, breaking and entering, skipping school, taking drugs and everything else that we used to brag about without merit in High School.<br/><br/>
And just as everything seems to be going extremely well for the young Matthew, one of his geek buddies reveals her true identity, that of an up-and-coming porn star.  This revelation comes shortly before the arrival of her pimp film producer Kelly (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant) who throws a wrench into the infatuational plans of the two neighbors and leads Matthew down a path that jeopardizes his endeavor to win the scholarship.   Soon, Kelly and Matthew are attending strip clubs, meeting in Vegas and eventually, the two are involved in a robbery where Matt tries to win the freedom of the young Danielle.<br/><br/>Much has been made of The Girl Next Door's resemblance to the 1983 Tom Cruise film Risky Business.  Truly, the comparisons cannot be more obvious. Instead of hookers, we have porn stars.  Instead of a house party, we have a prom, and where there is a family heirloom in play with Cruise's film, Hirsch must pull out all the stops in order to obtain a $25,000 bank account that was amassed to bring a Cambodian teenager to America.<br/><br/>But with all these comparisons evident, I enjoyed The Girl Next Door more. The High School situations have been updated, and I believed in how Matthew could be easily drawn into his world of love and admiration, something I didn't feel with Cruise and DeMornay.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, The Girl Next Door will not have the impact of Risky Business nor will it be the catapult for either Hirsch or Cuthbert that Business was for Cruise.  But it still was a rather enjoyable film.  Not filled with situations bordering on the asinine (see American Pie's 2 through 3), The Girl Next Door was a smart film that resembled a John Hughes film of the early 1980's.  I enjoyed all the characters from the geeks who are trying to find their sexual niche to the awkwardness and mature awakening of Matthew through the ordeal of following his dreams.  Whereas adolescent films recently have skewed into gross out comedy in such entries as The New Guy, American Pie and Van Wilder, The Girl Next Door gives us something fresh, a progressive out of character plot backed by the love of a beautiful woman.<br/><br/>All these funny and interesting struggles lead to the senior prom where the result might seem far fetched, but at least it seems as if the director meant it not to be taken with any notion of seriousness.  We understand the good guys from the bad guys and the movie makes no attempts to throw a surprise or two our way.  Maybe in its simplicity, it has found the answer to rejuvenating the youthful film movement.<br/><br/>So, back to my original blabbering.   Oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!  First noticed wearing pink panties in the 2003 popular film Old School, she is something to behold.  But can she fix a ball cock?  Don't answer that!"
"JWBly","7","10","10","1 December 2010"," Timothy Olyphant shines
","This is an enjoyable yet ultimately forgettable film. The ""boy rescues cute girl from terrible life"" plot has been done many times before, no doubt in many better ways. Emile Hirsch performs passably well with the material he is given, and the luscious Elisha Cuthbert provides plenty of eye candy that she could not show in 24. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional and barely worthy of mention. But the show belongs to Timothy Olyphant. Although he does not even appear until halfway through the film, his role makes the entire movie worth watching again. He screen presence is palpable as the ultra-cool bad boy that every man secretly wishes to be. Scruffy, chain-smoking, alternately funny, friendly then dangerous, he owns every scene in which he appears. Seeing this film makes one that much more anxious for the next season of JUSTIFIED to begin!"

","So yes most guys are going to see the movie because of the achingly beautiful and hot Elisha Cuthbert. And she only disappoints a little. Otherwise this is the perfect vehicle for her playing a porn star who is trying to change her ways and live more of a normal teen-age girl's life. As she stays at her aunt's house, she meets her next door neighbor after he spies on her undressing. I think a lot of guys will be able to relate to Emile Hirsch's character--a young guy who is trying so hard to break out of his shell. Along comes Elisha who is more worldly and adventurous and who actually likes him. He'd follow this girl anywhere and not one of us could blame him for girls like this rarely come along in life.The plot is somewhat predictable but the movie has enough funny, quirky and memorable characters that you will enjoy it anyway. There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party, while David Gray's ""This Years Love"" plays in the background. This same song plays again at the end when they are in the limo, but interestingly enough the song is not included on the movie soundtrack CD??? For guys like myself who are a little older, the movie represents a time in life when anything is possible and within reach if you just have that unreachable,beautiful woman by your side. Thing is, most young guys never believe they could get a girl like Elisha. So the movie is about much more than a porno star moving next door. Its about taking risks, putting your heart out there, reaching for what you want even though it appears unreachable. And finally, God, is Elisha Cuthbert just unreal!!!"
"cariart","Null","75","100","6 October 2004"," Engaging Homage to 80's Teen Flicks...
","THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Luke Greenfield's sexy yet sweet teen angst flick, owes a lot to both the RISKY BUSINESS premise (HS Senior, his goal a prestigious college, has his life turned 'upside-down' by world-wise 'Pro'), and the internal structure of John Hughes' 80's teen 'classics' (geeky hero, and his two geekier friends, gain acceptance and prestige through his relationship with a 'dream girl').<br/><br/>Close your eyes, and you could easily picture the young Anthony Michael Hall or John Cusack filling Emile Hirsch's role, with Rebecca De Mornay or Kelly Preston replacing Elisha Cuthbert as his ex-porn star girlfriend. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, however, actually works quite well, thanks to Greenfield's 'tongue-in-cheek' approach to the naughtiness, and a flawless supporting cast, particularly Timothy Olyphant as a likable but ultimately ruthless porn producer, and Timothy Bottoms and Donna Bullock, as Hirsch's clueless but blindly supportive parents. <br/><br/>Emile Hirsch shows a propensity towards 'soulfully earnest' expressions, but does provide one of the film's funniest scenes, as, while high on Ecstasy, he attempts to navigate through a crowd awaiting his speech on 'high moral fiber'. While some critics tended to brush off Elisha Cuthbert's performance as just another skin-baring 'boy toy' variation, she actually conveys the vulnerability and pain of her character's past quite effectively, balancing it with sly humor and a LOT of 'sex appeal', done within the restraints of her ""No Nudity"" contract clause...Sorry, guys, while you'll see a LOT of her skin, you AREN'T going to see Elisha 'bare all'...<br/><br/>The film is a very funny, breezy lark, and while it never achieves the heights of insanity of RISKY BUSINESS, it certainly stands as one of the better 'teen' comedies of the past few years!"
"jbengel-2","8","7","7","6 November 2006"," Much more than Risqué Business.
","Billed on the cover as ""American Pie meets Risky Business"" you'd expect The Girl Next Door to be one of the mindless teen comedies so ubiquitous in today's market. Typically I wouldn't have given this DVD a second look, but I like Elisha Cuthbert so I picked it up.<br/><br/>Not that this is a film destined to change the course of cinematic history, but it IS considerably more thoughtful than most of its genre. Yes, we know before the first scene opens what's going to happen. This is not just boy-meets-girl, this is more like boy-meets-fantasy-girl and if you've ever been an 18-year-old boy, or even known one for more than 15 minutes you can see what's coming. The only question is going to be how, right? Not really. What you won't see coming is a surprisingly poignant performance by Cuthbert as the girl jaded far beyond her years. The character Danielle is a vulnerable girl guarded by the brittle hard edge of a veteran of the adult film industry. But when she meets Matthew (Emile Hirsch) who knows her only as Danielle, the house-sitting niece of his next door neighbor she lets down her guard in the hope that she can reinvent herself in this smallish town where she's an unknown.<br/><br/>It probably would have worked too if not for the meddling influence of one of Matthew's friends, Eli (Chris Marquette). Eli, it seems, is plugged into the world of porn and reveals Danielle's secret to Matthew.<br/><br/>At the prodding of his friends, Matthew makes his play to bed the beautiful Danielle. A gambit that is as endearingly clumsy as it is predictable. But it is here that Cuthbert renders what -- for me -- is the defining moment of the film. And she does it in one word.<br/><br/>The word is ""Okay"", and is delivered in response to Matthew's suggestion that they get a room. In that moment, in that one word, we see Danielle pull back from Matthew and resign herself to the idea that she will never be anything more than the porn queen she was back in the big city. She sheds no tears, and she makes no sign that she knows that he's found her out until later. But in that one moment, we see the hope of the re-invention of Danielle evaporate in a way that's nearly palpable.<br/><br/>In the real world, this would have been the end of the movie. Lucky for us, this isn't the real world and Matthew somehow manages to mature enough in the next few scenes to attempt a comeback.<br/><br/>The details of the comeback are a source of great amusement including a break-in at the home of a big time producer, crashing the adult entertainment convention in Las Vegas, and showing up to deliver a speech to a scholarship committee after being slipped a dose of Ecstacy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, we can see that the two will eventually sort things out and they do. Though the way they do it is something of a surprise that I'll leave for the movie to tell you about.<br/><br/>If you liked Risky Business, The Breakfast Club, Ridgemont High, and the rest of this class, you'll like The Girl Next Door. If you LOVED those films, you might NOT like The Girl Next Door. Ardent fans of mindless comedy might find this film a little too deep for their tastes. And if you're expecting borderline soft core porn, you're going to be disappointed. While the film does contain some nudity (it would have been almost impossible for it NOT to) it's hardly chock full of gratuitous sex.<br/><br/>In the end, Cuthbert's character is compelling (more so than even her later versions of Kim Bauer on TV's ""24"") and Hirsch is the perfect foil for her. This is a movie worth seeing -- a rare feat in modern Hollywood."
"googles49_","9","20","24","14 January 2006"," Not a teen comedy. It's much more than that!
","I don't like the way this movie was marketed as if it is a teen comedy. YES it has the jocks and the losers but I wouldn't class this as a teen comedy at all. It's so much deeper and really much more of a love story / adventure because that's what happens.<br/><br/>The first 1/4 is pretty much your average Teen comedy and was mostly what you saw in the trailers. Hard working kid with no time for fun meets hot girl next door who just happen's to be a porn star with his loser mates talking about ""banging"" hot chicks and not getting any. Thats the plot overall but that doesn't make an enjoyable movie in my eyes. In fact I only watched this when a friend had it on DVD and let me borrow it. I didn't exactly go out my way to watch this. Now it's one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>This is because of where the film takes you and how much you can relate to what's happening. How many of you have felt your working to hard when you're young and not having much fun? How many of you have seen the perfect girl and wanted her so bad you'd do the craziest stuff? Half the ""stuff"" that happens through the film (especially the ending) you wouldn't have predicted from watching the first 1/4 and I want to tell you all the ""stuff"" but that would really spoil the first viewing (there will be more).<br/><br/>The film is almost perfectly made, the kids are all excellent and the two stars have sparks practically flying off them when they are together. The music is spot on and the twists and turns will take your emotions on a roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>This film is perfect for watching alone, with friends or with your girlfriend because its ""feel-good"", ""funny"" and really ""deep"" and really deserves better credit as it's more than just an above average teen comedy. It fully deserves your attention."

","Initially, I was simply lost in the world of late night pay television, and stumbled across this just as it started. After reading the description; (plot summary on the interactive program guide); I figured that this would be just the sleeping pill I needed to go to sleep with. Thankfully enough, I was wrong. As others have mentioned, this film pays homage to Risky Business, but in its own quirky way. Emile Hirsch simply comes across as a very likable high school kid who's never taken any kind of risk, has always had his life planned out, has his future all lined up... Until SHE moves in next door. Elisha Cuthberts' character starts out promising, but falls flat. There isn't enough development into her back-story, (aside from one quick reference to her high school days), no real telling of her story overall. Which isn't to say her performance was flat, it was well above par, and a whole different direction from the character she played on ""24"". Timothy Olyphant is perfect. He has enough depth in his character to make up for any other shortcomings this film suffers from. Overall, this is a mostly harmless film, that will leave the viewer with a smile, and maybe a chuckle or two. If you find yourself with a case of the late-night-can't-sleep-blues, go ahead, watch this. You won't be sorry."

The film had loadsa plus points - the acting by Elisha was top notch, her portrayl of the character Danielle was brilliant - she really cared for Matthew and knew if he found out her secret he would not like her and she wanted him to like her for who she was. I felt this scene was really good as we got to see Danielle as a person and how she doesn't always want to b seen as a Porn Star.<br/><br/>The interaction btween Danielle and Matthew was great - the chemistry was there alrighte - wish I was an actor and played the role of Matthew.<br/><br/>One idea thoe I felt cud have lasted till the end is Danielle and Matthew getting together, it wud have been good if they got together just b4 the prom and the end not half way through it, as the second half of the film lacked spice I felt.<br/><br/>Eli is one funny character - everytime he spoke he made me laugh and he reminds me of someone at my 6th form college. The supporting cast were excellent, Danielle's manager Kelly was funny and thought he was gonna get Matthew into trouble wiv the tape but was shocked to see what was on it, so Matthew kinda got his own back.<br/><br/>I will definatly buy this film when it is released on DVD sometime soon I hope and will watch it again and again. For a longer and fully version of my own review on the film plz visit my site which will hopefully b updated more often in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>This film is excellent, Elisha is amazing in this film and every scene she is in is brilliant as she lights up the screen wiv her looks, a truly talented and fine actress."

Straight-arrow high school senior spies on the girl next door, a gorgeous sexpot with a past in the adult film industry who now wants to start over. Then her ex-boyfriend/producer (Olyphant) shows up, hoping to bring her back into the business, while the high schooler knows she has a heart of gold and deserves better. Hirsch and Cuthbert are a sincere and engaging couple, and the laughs are certainly there, making this a cut above the norm-surprisingly smarter, sweeter, and more mature than its smutty premise suggests. Borrows heavily from RISKY BUSINESS and wanders onto a few plot detours that show the movie's true teen sex-romp colors and sometimes betray its sincerity (Hirsch's character replaces the stolen money he raised to bring a Cambodian foreign-exchange student by making a sex-ed film at prom).

Emil Hirsch is an amiable male lead, while Elisha Cuthbert looks far more beautiful here than she ever did in '24', although it's interesting that she looks better when appearing natural, than when dolled up as a porn-starlet. Timothy Olyphant adds a certain menacing charm to proceedings by apparently playing a watered-down version of the character he plays in 'Go'.<br/><br/>All in all a pretty good little movie that deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it got upon it's release.

Ignore any preconceived ideas of what this film is about (the trailers etc are very misleading) and go in with an open mind and hopefully you'll see what i mean. <br/><br/>Yes there are some very stupid scenes in the film but they are few and far between, and most of the humor comes from believable exchanges between the characters. But i hardly even see this film as a comedy, because underneath that Matt (Emile Hirsch) and Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) share a love that is more real and honest than any i have seen before. The characters seem to truly be in love, rather than just actors playing a role. (A scene that really shows this is the emotion shown by Danielle when Matt asks her to prom). <br/><br/>In addition to the actors remarkable performances (another stand out one being Timothy Olyphant in the role of a porn producer) there is also a very strong script, which manages (for the most part) to be genuinely funny while still seeming real and passionate.<br/><br/>Finally the soundtrack is outstanding providing brilliant songs that are perfect for the scene throughout.<br/><br/>Overall i give this film 10 out of 10, and highly recommend you go and see it, just remember to keep an open mind."

To be honest, before I saw this film I had only seen her briefly in Love Actually but as her name appeared in the programme synopsis on Sky I decided it was worth a look.<br/><br/>From the first time you see her she seems to express herself in such a natural way. The look on her face throughout the movie and in some scenes especially is so sincere she really brings the emotion of her character and the connection she has to Matthew to life.<br/><br/>I know I am not saying much about the film which, in itself, I thought was good but the main reason to watch this film is to see what an amazing talent Elisha Cuthbert is. I hesitate to use the word 'actor' as her character is so natural I get the feeling she is just being herself. These days, actors are so full of themselves it's hard to tell where one stops and another starts. Elisha Cuthbert, on the other hand, is in a league of her own and I have a feeling as her success gets even greater that she will retain this quality by just keep on being herself."

There are many elements of ""Risky Business"" in this movie, and the greatest modification is that Danielle is not a prostitute like Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), and I believe the writer got inspiration in that 1983 comedy to write this story. Elisha Cuthbert is extremely sexy and perfect for the role of Danielle, and Emile Hirsch fits very well for his character. However, Timothy Olyphant ""steals all the scenes"" as Kelly.

","I have no idea why this movie took in such a poor gross revenue since it was actually exceptionally good in the golden era of teen comedy.
Even though the plot as a whole is kinda cliched and predictable, it is still up-to-scratch to convey meaningful messages to audience like the sacrifice for loved ones when 'the juice is worth the squeeze' or the importance of having an eventful and wildly unforgettable high school years. Besides, the way the main characters resolved a series of continuous troubles is sublimely brilliant, in spite of some illogical trivia like the crime report scene (not going in details due to the spoilers-free status) or the quick mind-changing moments of the characters.
Finally, the performance of Elisha Cuthbert was remarkably well-acted as she vibrantly shows the personality of both a former porn star - seductive and easy-going, and a passionate lover, supportive and cheerful.

There were many laugh out loud moments including the AVN convention and the prom, but the awards dinner was possibly the best (tie scene and dancing).<br/><br/>While Emile and Elisha produce good chemistry and provide the plot foundation, it is the antagonistic relationship between Emile (Matt) and Timothy (Kelly) that keep you loving this movie. I could watch another movie based on these two alone.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of nerd friends serve the film well and provide excellent comedic relief.<br/><br/>On pondering what changes would make this movie rate as 9-10, I am still unsure because pushing the boundaries further might also push the movie too far across the absurdity line.

Emile Hirsch plays the perfect innocent straight A over-achiever and Elisha Cuthbert is very sweet and extremely likable and doesn't play the stereotypical ""girl next door"". Timothy Olyphant plays the perfect supporting role who is likable as well as coming across as the kind of guy you don't want to mess with! This is one of my favourite movies of all time just for its pure entertainment and feel factor. It is a very sweet love story with genuine comedy sprinkled on top of it.

"TheDoctorAnd","10","4","5","17 February 2011"," A Personal favourite of mine
","The Girl Next Door is probably my favourite film for many reasons. Firstly, I can relate to Matthew's character. Second, there a tons of quotable lines that could be you can use, without many people knowing where you got them from, and it also highly lives up to it's ""Romantic Comedy"" status (although quite different to normal Rom Coms), with a nice twist at the ending.<br/><br/>Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is in his senior year of High School. He tries to writing what he'll ""Always remember"" about High School, but quickly realises that he has nothing to write about. Later on, whilst he is taking the trash out and practising his speech for a scholarship to Georgetown, he notices a girl, Danielle (played by Elisha Cuthbert), who he instantly falls for. Later, she catches him looking at her getting undressed, to which she seemingly angrily goes round to his house to tell his parents. However, this is just the start, as she pushes him to do things ""He never thought he could do"", and gives him something to remember about High School. She, however, has a dark past, which threatens their relationship when Matthew finds out.<br/><br/>I am giving this film an easy 10/10. You would probably struggle to find another Rom Com like this one. Some people may call this film ""Strange"", and it is a bit, I suppose, but there is definitely a sort of uniqueness to it, that separates it from films like ""Love Actually"" and ""The Holiday"".<br/><br/>Should you watch it once? Yes. Should you watch it again? Yes. Should you watch it for a college project? If you want to. It's your life, after all (just don't say that TheDoctorAnd suggested to do it if you do)."

","A teen movie is not ususally my sort of film, but I like a good comedy and Elisha always brights up a man's day so I decided to give it a whirl. The premise is typical teen plot but the script is far more real (if you ignore the ex porn star moving in next door) than any other. It deals with first love in a way that is so personal that i defy anyone not to be touched by some of the moments in the film. The acting is spot on with Elisha and Emile showing an innocence that is necessary to stop the characters from becoming seedy and desperate. Although these two shine the stand out character and acting is by Timothy Olyphant, the villain of the piece. There are moments in the film where the comedy is kicked out of the park and you have to check again that you haven't flicked over to a psycho movie. But even he has some redeeming features. This movie is an example to all the EuroTrips and Old Schools out there who think crude is funny all the time and that's all you need in a film.

The characters are likable big time.<br/><br/>If you are looking for the typical romantic comedy you will be disappointed big time.<br/><br/>Elisha Cuthbert really impressed me because she delivered a performance where she had to be sexy, tender, dramatic, and brave. She delivered more than expected plus she's very beautiful. Emile Hirsch also gives a good performance and it's a likable guy. Timothy Olyphant stole the show in my opinion. The rest of the cast is also very good and seems to be great chemistry between them.<br/><br/>The vibe of the movie is really comfortable and that's because of the characters and the porno sub-plot. I mean, the clothes Elisha wears and the whole porn atmosphere is just great.<br/><br/>I recommend this one if you are looking for crude sex comedies that take a little more time on plot development."
"jind","8","4","5","11 November 2006"," teenager graduating learns the true meaning of respect for another person
","When I first rented this movie, I was actually expecting to watch another usual teen comedy, but, what I wound up seeing was the 2006 version of how a boy who is graduating learns the real meaning of how to respect another person. When we first meet the young boy, he hangs out with a not so popular crowd and seems very frustrated by it. One evening while taking out the garbage, he winds up meeting his new next neighbour, ""the girl next door"" and he falls in love with her at first sight because she is physically beautiful. After he accidentally sees her without her top on, they actually wind up going out for the evening, and that is when the true meaning of a relationship starts up between them. She actually starts showing him how to have respect for a girl, and this wonderful message actually becomes the basis for the whole story. The two actually have a real chemistry together. The movie itself winds up giving out the wonderful message to the youth of today and tomorrow that if you don't respect another person, you don't know what a real relationship is. The movie itself is a real ""classic"" in my opinion for this reason and that is why I am glad to have it in my DVD collection. I would honestly consider this to be a real modern day ""cinderella story"" and I really hope to see Hollywood making more of these types of films, because honestly, these are the types of films that dreams are made of.The movie itself also has a lot of good laughs in it. If you want to do yourself a favor, either rent it for the evening or buy it to enjoy it over and over."
"Arlis","10","4","5","8 November 2006"," A funny movie full of heart! If only all comedies were this funny.
","I watched this movie tonight for the first time and wasn't expecting much from it. I am not a big fan of comedies and especially teen comedies. I bought this about 2 years ago and it is the unrated version. I have come to realize ""unrated"" in Hollywood is just a way to make a movie sell. It's like they show you the PG-13 version in theaters and then show you the R version on DVD, yet they call it UNRATED. I am here to tell you its not that nasty - it doesn't push the envelope or shock anyone.<br/><br/>BUT....<br/><br/>I loved it! It had so much heart and soul that I finished it thinking WOW. I laughed my ass of, I shed tears because it hit some personal notes and I won't ever forget seeing it.<br/><br/>I had to give it a perfect 10 rating because it impressed me that much. I loved these characters and thought they were well casted and worked so good together. Not a lot of big actors and I think that helps make a movie seem more real.<br/><br/>The story was great and it was very original and I think if you haven't seen this movie then YES go buy it or rent it or whatever because you will like it I PROMISE!"
"theshadow908","8","4","5","25 May 2006"," A teen comedy that actually has a good story!
","The Girl Next Door tells the story of Matt Kidman, a highly intelligent high school student who plays it safe so he can get into Georgetown University. When he begins dating his new next door neighbour Danielle, he discovers that she is a former porn star and it throws his life off balance as a series of disturbing events begin to plague him. What I like about The Girl Next Door is that when you look at the cover or see the trailers, it looks like a raunchy sex comedy like American Pie. However, when you watch it you'll see that it's got some very funny moments, but also some touching dramatic moments. It has a really good story that separates it from other teen comedies.<br/><br/>All of the actors in this movie do a really good job. Emile Hirsch, who I'd never heard of before this really impressed me with his acting skill. He definitely has the potential to move on to greater things. I've seen Elisha Cuthbert in different things like Popular Mechanics for Kids and Are You Afraid of the Dark, but this is her breakout film. Not to mention that she is one of the most smoking hot actresses in Hollywood today, but that's besides the point. She plays her role really well. Timothy Olyphant is hilarious as Danielle's manager.<br/><br/>Another good thing about The Girl Next Door is that if you look beyond just the movie, you'll see the film actually has useful messages. Overall, this movie is above and beyond any other teen comedy, and everyone involved deserves congratulations on a job well done.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jwinten-1","8","4","5","6 May 2006"," The movie next door
","An enticing movie, The Girl Next Door is a story involving the typical loser, Matthew Kidman, played by Emile Hirsch and ""Danielle"", played by Elisha Cuthbert.<br/><br/>Danielle is the girl next door, the ex pornography star who decides that the ordinary life is the good life, while Matthew is the affixed neighbour who falls in love at first sight.<br/><br/>Character development is strong, helping to maintain director Luke Greenfield's steady pace. We see the extension of supporting actors Chris Marquette and Paul Dano, who provide much needed humour and support to Hirsch.<br/><br/>Overall, this film presents a situation which most would find difficult to manage. It explores the pornography industry as perhaps a place of loneliness and misunderstanding, and by and large I would recommend anyone who is able to appreciate such themes to see this film."
"morphion2","7","4","5","29 April 2006"," Borders on exceeding expectations
","When a teen comedy is released, everyone knows just about what to expect. There'll be a unpopular high school student (""Van Wilder"" chose the maverick route and made him popular) who suffers from either sexual or emotional problems, there'll be a group of flawed but nonetheless faithful friends to help them out and there'll be a hot girl who takes inexplicable interest in Unpopular Student. There'll be a message, a moral, a contemporary soundtrack and a lot of sex. Such were everyone's expectations for ""The Girl Next Door"" Luke Greenfield's 2004 contribution to the genre, starring Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch, the advertising emphasis on the former.<br/><br/>Matthew Kidman (Hirsch) is a slightly repressed, highly unfulfilled near-graduate who aspires to win a scholarship to Georgetown on the basis of Moral Fiber. His dissatisfaction with overall life stems from his seeming incapacity to take a risk, to do something spontaneous and wild. Enter Danielle (Cuthbert), the gorgeous, free-spirited young niece of Matthew's next door neighbor, who is house-sitting for a few weeks. Immediately Matthew falls in love, and it would seem that the attraction is at least semi-reciprocated; for once he is feeling really, truly good about his life. What tips the film over from romantic comedy to teen comedy is not the presence of teenage characters, but the point when Matthew learns the perfect Girl Next Door is a porn-star.<br/><br/>If the premise sounds 'typically teen' and derivative of the much more successful 80's flick ""Risky Business"", then that's because it is, on both counts. However, as much as I'd like to dismiss this as yet another thoroughly forgettable, sexploitative perpetuation of a film-genre that hasn't been truly inspired in 20 years, something holds me back. There's a touch of admirableness to this film, a hint of maturity, a vague, familiar scent of a movie that wants to say something, that had more in mind than an admittedly beautiful girl taking her clothes off. The real problem is that, as sweet as the message of love clearly is, the film is just too inconsistent. One moment it's making an almost pertinent point, the next it's having a go at teenage virgins. One moment it's witty, the next it's vulgar. One moment it's smart, the next it's stupid.<br/><br/>It's this kind of inconsistency that gives you the feeling that the film-makers had a half-decent idea in their hands, but were, like their lead protagonist Matthew, afraid to take a risk. They border on breaking the mold at some points, but then they lose their nerve and retreat back into familiar but tired cliché. For instance, the opening 45 minutes or so of ""The Girl Next Door"" had me thinking I'd pegged this movie all wrong, even after the revelation of Danielle's profession. The whole thing was handled with astounding maturity, considering what kind of film we're dealing with. ""How do you want me?"" Danielle asks seductively of Matthew as she lies topless on the motel bed, aware now of his confused motives. The scene plays with unbelievable ridiculousness that even the fans would have to acknowledge, until Matthew comes through and speaks on behalf of the audience; ""Why are you doing this?"" Danielle then starts to show the kind of emotional damage we would realistically respect from her; ""Isn't this what you want? To f*ck a porn-star in a cheap motel?"" Hurt, she leaves Matthew to think about his careless actions, in turn leaving us thinking this bears startling resemblance to something that could actually happen in real life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this feeling doesn't last long. Strangely it is the entrance of the film's show-stealer, Timothy Olyphant, which marks the beginning of the film's decline. Olyphant's character Kelly, Danielle's former producer and charismatic sleaze is superbly acted and written, but seems like he's gate-crashing a film he doesn't really belong in. Ensuing his arrival are the much less interesting and involving (if, granted, rather humorous) aspects of the film: Danielle leaves peaceful suburbia with Kelly to resume her life of degradation, Matthew sacrifices his grades and potential scholarship to attend the Adult Film Convention to bring her back, and ends up bloodied, wanted by authorities and high on ecstasy; a state in which he must give a speech to a hall full of people on why he must get a scholarship for Moral Fiber. And of course, in true romantic comedy tradition, the speech is completely improvised, all about Danielle (who has returned out of true love) and receives heart-felt applause. The only typical cliché that wasn't used was to end the film there; it's just too bad that what followed was ridiculous, tedious and dragged on for far too long.<br/><br/>So I suppose you could say I'm in two minds about it. In a way, the film for me was a bit of a catch 22; all the faults would not have stood out or mattered nearly as much if it hadn't opted to show potential to be a much better, more interesting movie. On the other hand, the pleasant surprises it had to offer were, along with Timothy Olyphant, by far the best things about it. I guess what it all boils down to though is this; ""The Girl Next Door"" was not a film I expect to have strong opinions about. And it sure showed me."
"shanfloyd","8","4","5","17 October 2005"," One of the most enjoying teen comedies...
","Saying that, the film should not exactly be confined into the name of 'teen flick'. Thanks to Greenfield's excellent handling with the characters and the innovative smart script, the film explores a lot into character development. The characters are not at all stereotypical as expected in such films. Gradual changes that came into them were finely portrayed by the actors too, especially Emile Hirsch. Another accomplishment for the film is that it was able to produce some 'sweet grace' in its romantic atmosphere. Simply, I considered the film multi-dimensional. Clearly the film wasn't intended to be marketed that way.<br/><br/>Considering the plot and the storyline, I admit there had to be some clichés. It was never Greenfield's intention to make an art film with this plot after all. But he handles sex and nudity in brilliant mastery to make it suitable for teenagers. The basic story may be inspired by ""Risky Business"" but there were touches of Greenfield's innovative thinking and smart plot twists everywhere.<br/><br/>And Elisha Cuthbert has everything the viewers' masculine urges can possibly wish for. Besides giving us the best visual treat possible under a no-nudity contract, she also gives a nice performance. Keeping in mind her talent, the screenwriters could explore her character a bit more in my opinion, like her background. Yet she makes it sure that people who like this film would follow her career quite earnestly afterwards."
"Ben_Cheshire","8","4","5","14 September 2005"," This sweet romantic comedy is ABOUT not PART OF the porn industry.
","Matthew has spent his high-school years valuing high-achieving, so when he meets (Elisha Cuthbert) in the lead-up to his scholarship application speech for Georgetown, she helps him see some other sides to himself. Things change when he finds out she might be from an entirely different side of the tracks...<br/><br/>The marketing was somewhat misleading for this flick. Although the concepts are definitely for mature audiences - a porn industry event (sans nudity), two short shots of actual porn, quite a bit of language and adult themes, this movie is not by any means exploitation. The radiant Elisha Cuthbert who we've come to know and love from 24 is beautiful but doesn't have to do any frontal nudity.<br/><br/>Its basically a sweet romantic comedy at heart, a coming of age story, and a story about leaving high-school that everyone can relate to. Like I said, i'd still recommend only mature audiences - but for us, its a surprisingly sweet evening."

"CrimsonJet","9","5","7","15 August 2006"," If only every teen sex comedy were this way
","The art of making a teen sex comedy is usually associated with immaturity and gross-out tactics that for some reason make most people double over in laughter (prime example: American Pie's ""Pale Ale"" scene). While those tactics usually prove to be quite entertaining, The Girl Next Door puts it all to shame.<br/><br/>The most noticeable difference between this movie and the dozens of others in its genre is the form of the laughs; plenty of them are crude, but they still retain good taste. A lot of the lines are just plain great, such as when Eli sits in the kids' Health class claiming, ""I could make a better sex ed video with my mom."" Even more can be said about the characters. Half the fun of this movie is seeing the different sides of these teenagers as they deal with their problems, and how they develop in doing so. Eli is a hilariously shy teen with hormones raging beyond belief; Klitz reminds you of every nerd you've ever seen, yet the irony is that he's the ballsiest of the bunch; and Matthew's start as a highly motivated, up-tight kid who's almost too smart for his own good makes for even more fun when he comes out of his shell and becomes a realistic, confident young man. The acting in all these roles is better than most would expect, and the fact that each of the actors are about 20 years old makes it seem much more real than films that used actors like Jason Biggs and Freddie Prinz, Jr. as high school students. Elisha Cuthbert's performance is especially good as the sexy title character, Danielle: she pulls the character's air of hidden innocence off with great skill.<br/><br/>Behind all the great humor and characters, The Girl Next Door's story and direction are just plain terrific, and for once in a teen sex comedy, there is a presence of vision. The camera angles and editing are well-utilized to reflect the mood of each scene. The incredible soundtrack gives it another big boost, as every track seems like it was made exclusively for its scene, especially in the ending sequence with the use of the Who's Baba O'Riley.<br/><br/>Though this film is near-perfect, it does leave you wishing for more. Even though it's all richly entertaining, you finish the movie wishing that it made you laugh more than it did. However, that is no reason to miss this masterpiece."

","This movie exceeded my expectations. I expected a ""hey look at the hot chick with the dork"" teen crap movie. What I got was a movie that has depth and still retains its comedic edge. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are excellent together. Elisha Cuthbert does something I haven't seen for a while out of an actress: she acts with her eyes first, then the rest of her follows. Like the DVD extras said Emile Hirsch does this as well, but Elisha is definitely more adept at this. She is a very underrated actress, probably because she's gorgeous to such a great degree. I hope to see more of her in movie roles that don't concentrate so much on how good she looks."
"yuchunz","9","5","7","8 February 2006"," Funny movie
","This movie is so funny. It demonstrated a teenager's loving story with two cute actor/actress. <br/><br/>Elisha Cuthbert is the most gorgeous actress I have ever been seen in my life. I cannot imagine such a beautiful would be a porn star. Anybody tell me why she is so hot? Definitely, Elisha did the good thing, without being naked in the play, just a lot of pictures making you assume she is naked. Kelly, Danielle's ex-boyfriend, is so atrocious, but another porn producer, Hugo, is more powerful than him. I think the only shortcoming of the movie is that it is not necessary to bring up a story about raising money for a Cambodian student to study in America, any other plot would have been better, I mean it is not understandable. Of course the director may have his own opinion. By the way, some pictures in the movie are kind of offensive such as those having sex in tape, it is not essential for the movie, I think.<br/><br/>Another two friends of Matt are also had a great performance in the movie, this movie reminds me of what I looked like as high school student, doing whatever you want without thinking about the consequence and risk it at all. It is so closed to our real life. <br/><br/>I cannot write anymore because I am going to be insane."
"syphon103","7","5","7","3 January 2006"," Very watchable indeed
","What a lovely, lovely film. <br/><br/>This is definitely not a stereotypically vacuous teen flick. Quite the contrary. It is exactly what I presume it set out to be - an accessible, friendly feel-good treat. And here's why: From a male point of view - such a sizable dose of Elisha Cuthbert is delightful. Her acting is very suitably sexy, lacking in depth maybe, but then that is excused by the generally simple format of the film. There are some genuinely funny moments, the comedy is very varied, as opposed to the one-level 'American Pie' toilet humour of most other films in this genre. There are some nice twists and turns, and it's all very nicely satisfying.<br/><br/>It is definitely worth a watch, for sure. If nothing else than because the way that this film embodies that feeling of everything in your life being overwhelmingly wonderful."

","Okay, I'm a guy. And pure chick flicks (i.e. anything with that British twit who was brilliant in 4 Weddings and a Funeral but has sucked ever since) suck. But I was totally sucked in by this movie. I laughed, I cried (well, my eyes got a little watery). <br/><br/>True, it's about high school kids trying to get laid. But it works. After all, high school kids can be involved in real drama that goes beyond Laguna Beach or 90210.<br/><br/>I really recommend this move despite the superficial appearance that it might be a sappy or cheesy teen movie. It's not. Check it out.<br/><br/>The squeeze is worth the juice."
"Krustofski","9","5","7","13 June 2005"," Quite Possibly The Movie With The Most Heart...Ever
","The Girl Next Door was a very decent movie that screened in 198-- what the hell am I kidding, I don't know crap about the 1980 version of The Girl Next Door, all I know is that for the first time in film history, there is a remake, that actually has heart. It also helps that it's pretty hilarious to boot. When an average, otherwise loser teenager starts dating the ex-porno-actress that recently moved in next door, he learns many things. One, especially, is that being a professional hump-bunny is no way to make a living, which is strange, seeing how the first half of the movie tries to get you excited with the idea of a human car living fifty feet away. I'll be truthful, this movie is, well, a teen movie. But it's also a teen movie thats actually funny, and actually has a soul, and can actually be identifiable to the audience known as: the human(s). The acting is the movie is surprisingly fantastic, the script is well-written, the humor is smart and carried out fufillingly, and the best part of this movie is that unlike thousands of family movies before it, it actually teaches teens lessons helpful through getting high school. Strange, seeing it's R rating. Overall, I like this movie. It's funny, it has a glimmer of cute romance, and it's one of my favorite films released in the 00' years. If you take out all the nudity and profanity and sex, what you got here is a full-hearted family film that everyone can enjoy. Anyone over thirteen should see this. Anyone over fifteen needs to see this. A good two hours well spent."
"midlandseafishing","10","5","7","6 September 2004"," A bit of a shock!
","Well I wasn't expecting this, but as a lead I will tell you that in my opinion this is fantastic. Before now the best teen type movie was ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". A great film because it went past the teen film genre and threw in an escalator of scenes that kept you held. Now this film does the same thing, but it adds twists too.<br/><br/>The American Teen Genre has for a long time been perfected, but it has been lacking twists due to the fact they have no depth. Lets be honest, if you add depth to an American Teen film it stops being what it is meant to be.<br/><br/>Enter ""The Girl Next door"". The Director has managed to make a film that still stays in the same genre, and yet has just enough depth to be able to pull off a few twists. What a good job the Director did too! There is not much let up, and one second your feeling sorry for him, another second your feeling happy for him as the film turns from being a comedy to a drama and back to a comedy again in a relentless fashion. Not quite edge of the seat stuff, but then again it isn't supposed to be. This genre isn't supposed to be this good! I must add a comment that it isn't a family film, and unless you want your kids to watch a few porn stars strut about your house plying there body's to would be producers and directors then you had better make sure you have got them to bed before you put the disc in. <br/><br/>John Hughes, the director of Ferris, Uncle Buck and more has a new challenger. <br/><br/>Great Story, well written and directed, great acting."

The rest of the movie is quite good delivering a good moral and a nice little twist at the end.

What is most heartening about this movie, is the way the characters interact, but mostly how Danielle coaxes Matthew out of his shy shell. Emile Hirsch is too new to the craft to have been handed the leading role here. His acting leaves a lot to be desired, but Elisha Cuthbert is a living goddess and shines in this role.

","There are few moments in life where something vastly exceeds your expectations. This movie was one of those things. I saw that this movie was playing on TV and thought that I might as well check it out. I remember seeing commercials for the movie as a young boy, and since then I have always assumed it was just a sex comedy. I'm sure that is what almost everyone thought about the movie honestly. Let me just say one thing; the marketing for this movie really missed the boat. This movie is so much more than a sex comedy; in fact, while being both sexy and funny, I don't think that ""The Girl Next Door"" fits into that genre. It gives you such a genuinely good feeling when you watch it, it's great. It really reminds you of ""Risky Business"" when you watch it, both technically and in the plot. I have to say, however, that despite loving Risky Business, I love this movie more. Maybe it's because I'm going through a time in my life similar to this movie, but it really is incredible. The acting, music and plot are all perfect. Just watch it, trust me"

","The Girl Next Door is a perfect film for the movie night. It's fun, entertaining. It's not that serious, but at the same time it has a point. And I liked a plot a lot. Quite original in my opinion. Credit to director Luke Greenfield for not letting this one to go too out of hands by putting in some intense scenes as well. It's a top notch entertainment.<br/><br/>Young actors Emile Hirsch and Paul Dano look very young here. They do fine, especially Hirsch by developing his character. But it is Elisha Cuthbert who steals every minute of the screen. Arguably one of the hottest characters. Her sexiness is irresistible. Jeez, burns like a fire.<br/><br/>There is definitely something instructional in this movie. It is summed up nicely in this metaphor used in the movie: 'you got to know whether the juice is worth to squeeze or not.' So squeeze whenever you can. I prefer orange juice."

","The Girl Next Door is a pretty entertaining movie. It has many scenes that are hard not to watch and that make you interested in the unravelling of the film. Though it also got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while. Emile Hirsh is the central character Matthew Kidman, about to graduate from high school. The girl next door is Elisha Cuthbert is the title character, Danielle. Her character acts very differently from the beginning to the end of the film. She changes quite drastically in personality and its quite good yet odd in a way. Also it was quite strange how at first from meeting Matthew the way she acts with him. It seemed like she was just using him, but as we see throughout the film she does end up liking him. Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny though also contains a few dramatic scenes (many involving Matthew & Kelly, and Matthew & Danielle- a strip club scene). <br/><br/>Also I found many of the characters to be quite annoying, specifically Matthew's two friends- Eli and Klitz, and Kelly (he was very crude and weird). I feel the writers made his character too over-the-top. There are also some weird and quite odd scenes (Matthew's speech, limo scene) but overall the film is pretty entertaining as a whole."

How is anyone else responsible for the theft expect for the lady? since when can you cash an account with only your good looks? also the speech part was cut a little short IMO.

","Honestly I don't see why people give this movie such a bad rap. I don't understand Roger Ebert's review of the movie at all seeing that I thought Elisha Cuthbert played the role of Danielle extremely well. She was sexy and sweet and also added a little needed flair to the film. She had to nearly control Matt to help him break out of his shell. much like brad Pitt did for Edward Norton in fight club. This movie was funny yet it was somewhat a love story and something we all can relate to whether your still in school or not. although obviously this isn't your typical family movie I believe that it sends a message that we can all appreciate. It's what's on the inside that counts and that sometimes all we need is a little help to open up and realize our full potential. I think Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch deserve their due for great performances that remind me how great the early years are and for some of you how great they were. As it's said ""The juice was worth the squeeze"""

","Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely the hottest girl alive. She makes the movie one to be watched over and over again. The movie is well written, very well edited, and the movie really has some core values; one of them is risking everything for the one you love, another is standing by your friends (""tripod""). Also the story is amazing.. its about giving people second chances... Elisha plays the young lost pornstar and Matthew Kidman believes that she is more than that. I only wish I was in his shoes! Although some parts may seem amateurish.. (The porn director pointing his fingers..., When he loses Sam-Yangs money... it seems a bit weak...) but it doesn't matter because it is flooded out by the spectacular somewhat realistic story of a teenage love. <br/><br/>Anyone who hasn't seen the movie...

A movie with Elisha Cuthbert is something you must wait for until you can't hold it anymore. Next to Mila Jovovich probably the most beautiful woman in the world. I was a bit afraid and was expecting just another teen movie to be honest. I was wrong. It was nice and entertaining. This is a movie you must see with your girlfriend or boyfriend. It will tell you about true love between two people and how far someone will go to give proof of that true love. If you watch carefully you will understand the lesson the director and the writer try to tell you. Next to Elisha Cuthbert I was surprised with the performance of Chris Marquette as Eli and Timothy Olyphant as Kelly. Marquette is very funny as the would-be porn director and whenever I saw Olyphant playing a had to think back to Michael Keaton in his earlier movies for some reason. Like I wrote I saw this movie on DVD and it has some great bonus material too. Interesting audio commentary and even a very nice trivia track. The hilarious feature called 'The Eli XXXperience' is a must see on the DVD. The movie has a bit of an open ending so when do we get 'The Girl Next Door 2 : Back In Business' ? What me concerns start writing and shooting because I want more Girl Next Door (on condition Elisha Cuthbert is in it of course)"

","I was completely blown away by this movie. The first half hour was what I expected from the commercials - the typical teenage sex romp, T&A flick that has been done a million times, showing nothing more inventive than American Pie or Porky's before it. At this point I wrote the movie off as nothing better, nothing worse then what came before it.<br/><br/>Then, at about the hour mark, it morphs into one of the best coming of age movies Hollywood has produced in a long time. Suddenly the story is not about Elisha Cuthbert's physical attributes (though they are lovely), but about the perfect student/son breaking out of his cocoon and finding his true self in the ether. <br/><br/>At the same time the movie transforms from a fairly standard teen flick into one of the more bizarre comedies released in some time. The movie unleashes a series of plot twists stranger than the one before it, culminating in an inventive climax and resolution. <br/><br/>Add in some of the biggest belly laughs I've had at the movies since Old School, and it becomes perhaps the second most brilliant movie in the coming of age genre after Fast Times.<br/><br/>Now, that said, it is important to note that ""Girl Next Door"" is a total ripoff of Risky Business. And a lazy one at that. The similarities are many - perfect son/student rescues sweet girl from flesh trade, fighting off evil, violent pimp/manager, etc. In fact, they go as deep as the editing and the way particular music was used to highlight key scenes.<br/><br/>The assessment? If you can forget cinematic history, this is one of the more inventive, original and charming pieces of comedic cinema I have experienced in the last, say, five years. If you must remain true to what has come previously, it's a charming rip-off.<br/><br/>9/10"

But this film sees that bet and raises it.

He's handsome so women will love to watch him, but not too handsome that men will want to watch him too. After this, his peers started watching him and he's been getting accolades for his talent.<br/><br/>""The Girl Next Door"" is for everybody getting frustrated with the poor state of teen comedies. You can watch this without hanging your head in shame."

","There is a point in ""The Girl Next Door - Unrated Edition' (which I received and promptly devoured, extra's and all, in one sitting) where the movie is in danger of changing in tone and focus from American Pie to Showgirls, but luckily for the movie - and viewers it recovers itself and ends in a definite teen comedy spirit.<br/><br/>I never saw this movie in the theater so I cannot comment on what has been added to this ""unrated edition"" but there is certainly quite a lot of nudity, but nothing involving the main actors. There are some graphoc scenes at a strip club (including lap dancing) and we get shots of one of the main actors watching a porn video at home. There are some nude scenes from behind of both principal actors Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert, but as Hirsch points out on Side B of the disc (where most of the extras are located) the movie used a stand-in for those shots.<br/><br/>I have a word of caution regarding the list of extra's on the Amazon page. One is titled a scebne specific commentary bu Hirsch and Cuthbert. What we have here though is not a commentary for the whole movie from the two stars, but rather several scenes on the flip side of the disc in which the two actors both give separate commentary.<br/><br/>Largely (and unjustly) ignored at the box office this teen comedy starts of really well and within the first few moments had me rolling with laughter. The movie starts with a montage of sorts, we see the jocks, brains and cheerleader-types all stating, for their entry in the yearbook, what they ""will always remember."" Then there is Matt (played by Hirsch) who is pondering this question. Sure, he has had a successful academic career - as illustrated by his acceptance to Georgetown - but he really hasn't done anything memorable in his senior year of high school.<br/><br/>That's about to change for Matt though with the arrival next door of Danielle (played by Cuthbert), who mplays a breathtaking beauty house sitting for his neighbors.<br/><br/>Entranced by her Matt is unable to stop himself from watching Danielle undress in the window opposite his bedroom - but he is spotted. From that moment he is on a roller-coaster ride. Danielle, amused and evidently attracted to Matt, shows him the excitement of living on the edge, from running naked through the streets to moonlight skinny dipping in his school principal's pool.<br/><br/>Just as everything seems to be going so well between Matt and Danielle, Matt is shocked when one of his best friends Eli (who is a connoisseur of porn movies and full of in-experienced sex advice) shows one of his porn movies - in which Danielle is the main star.<br/><br/>Foolishly following some of his friends advice, the two part company and moments later the movie changes tack and takes on a decidedly darker and more serious tone as Matt becomes sucked into the shadowy world of the pornographic movie industry. Initially charming and friendly towards Matt, Danielle's producer and one-time boyfriend Kelly (played well by Timothy Olyphant) turns violent and antagonistic towards the youth who has his mind set on getting Danielle out of the industry.<br/><br/>This all comes to boiling point when the sleazy producer drugs Matt and sets him up for a robbery.<br/><br/>What follows is both inventive and highly amusing. How will Matt afford to get into Georgetown? What will become of Danielle? These are just some of the questions in this entertaining movie that borrows heavily and liberally from a number of the John Hughes movies of the 1980s and the American PIE movies of more recent years. The movie ends on a high note in a conclusion that is both satisfying and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now onto the part that most readers of this review are more interested in - the extra's. On Side A of the disc we have an okay director's commentary from director Luke Greenfield and an at times amusing and at other times fascinating trivia track.<br/><br/>Then on Side B of the disc we have the aforementioned seven to eight scene specific commentaries from Hirsch and Cuthbert (Hirsch curiously has one more) and deleted and extended scenes with optional directors commentary. None of these scenes are of any particular value to anyone but completists or fans of the movie. They add nothing to the feature, but do have a curiosity factor to them. They also chose the better of the two endings also.<br/><br/>Of more interest is an amusing featurette in which actor Chris Marquette (who plays Eli in the movie) poses as a porn producer and lures in all too interested men (there'e a cute blonde on the bed afterall) who get decidedly less interested (for the most part) when the girl is replaced by a big burly guy.<br/><br/>We are also offered a stills gallery and a VERY short gag reel as well as trailers for a couple of other like minded movies in addition to one promotional trailer for several other Fox titles. There is also a trailer for THE GIRL NEXT DOOR with the subtitle 'Dirrrty,' which in reality isn't really that much of a big deal.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good and entertaining movie, it seems to lose its footing half way through but successfully and engagingly returns to top form before the final credits roll. This is a definite must-buy for fans of the movie and the genre and certainly great entertainment"

The movie probably will give you a good tingle in the end. That comment doesn't mean the movie is bad. It would give you a tingle like the ending in Sleepless in Seattle. If you haven't seen that, then... Titanic only without the sad ending... no? OK, then... ummm Romeo and Juliet? sad ending too right?<br/><br/>OK... the ending will make you feel good. THERE! NO SAD PARTS."
"erika-64","8","3","4","11 November 2005"," better than I expected
","Elisha Cuthbert's portrayal of the character Danielle was much more sensitive and realistic than I had expected. The entire movie, while having its necessary idiotic moments and ridiculous plot, was filled with more nuance and tenderness than I had thought possible from this plot and genre. Most romantic comedies, and certainly most movies about the adult film industry, are hesitant to deal with the shattered and abused souls, manipulation, coercion, and youth of the female adult film stars. Elisha and the director of the film, Luke Greenfield, manage to make a sexy, funny, wholly enjoyable film while not shying away from the tragedies of Danielle's personal history. Kudos to the cast and directors for pulling this off."
"TheOtherFool","6","6","11","26 November 2004"," Weird, fun yet uneven
","With all the good intentions this movie may have been made with (a story about growing up, save sex, friendship and the likes), it will probably be remembered most as the movie in which Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is showing of an awful lot of skin. Not that I, or most of the (male) audience, mind, that is. <br/><br/>And it's the filmmaker's own fault the movie is looked upon that way. It starts out with young and inexperienced Matthew (Emile Kidman) peeping at his new nextdoorgirl while undressing. He's attracted to her (hmm, yes what teenage guy wouldn't...) and from that moment on she takes him out to make him feel more secure about himself. When they arrive at a party Matthew just feels he should do something, and there's a wonderful scene in which he just steps over his shyness to kiss her, while David Gray is singing his breathtaking This Years Love. Beautiful scene, very recognizable.<br/><br/>But then the movie flies all over the place again, with porn, a political speech, a golden penis, violence and drugs all taking its place. No, seriously. <br/><br/>This all makes up for an uneven film, in which the falling in love scenes between Matthew and Danielle, how unlikely they may be, make up for the best scenes of the film. They even got David Gray to sing his song for a second time! But on the other hand the movie is messy and too hard tries to fit in a happy ending. <br/><br/>Too bad as The Girl Next Door sure has some things to offer. 6/10."

The themes in this movie were incredibly superficial - what about the ""I'm so ashamed to be a porn-star"" theme - all I have to say about this is ""what!?!""

"bob the moo","Null","7","16","23 August 2004"," Poor plot, poor material, no laughs, forced titillation for boys and a crude air produce a film that will have almost no appeal outside of the male teen market
","Matthew Kidman is a geek; school president, hangs out with other nerds and generally doesn't have any luck with the popular guys or the girls. He can't believe his luck when a gorgeous girl moves in next door and seems happy to hang out with him. His illusions are shattered when he learns that she is a porn star and, unsure of how to act, he ruins things between them. But both seem reluctant to truly break it off but can they work through their differences.<br/><br/>Even though I like to think that I have good taste in films, I did see the trailer and thought 'hmmm, could be sexy and funny' and decided to give it a go on DVD. However if I'd known that it would really be neither then perhaps I wouldn't have bothered. The plot is pretty simplistic and is really the ultimate teenage boy fantasy, but it is this at the expense of the issues that could have been put into the film. Porn is a complex and nasty business and those involved in it can easily have difficult relationship and lives, however this film doesn't do anything with this aspect of the plot (apart from Matty wanting Danielle out of the business). The lowest point was a throwaway line that one of the porn stars had lost her virginity at age 10. Sorry, but the implication that a woman got into the sex industry of the back of sexual abuse as a child (and all that brings mentally and emotionally) is not a joking matter and I was stunned that nobody had the good taste to remove this line. Of course this is a comedy so I wouldn't expect it to do this because it would take away from the laughs but, with this film, the writers have already taken the laughs away and replaced with crude material and ineffective titillation.<br/><br/>For teenage boys then I can imagine this mix will work but for me it just didn't tickle me at all. There were no real jokes here and, instead, there are just jocular references to porn mixed with scenes of 'hot girls', semi-nudity and the inevitable (and increasingly boring) girl/girl kissing. I had hoped that it would have a fun sexy air to it but it really didn't, instead it was ground in crudity and the obvious sexuality of porn. Of course some of it was still quite sexy but generally it was for teenagers more than anything else. Sadly this also took priority over the material and as a result the actual romance is flat and unconvincing  we are meant to buy Danielle changing her life for Matt but their relationship is so thin as to not exist  and playful flirting at the start just doesn't didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Like many others, part for my motivation for seeing this film was 24's Elisha Cuthbert, but I felt a bit bad for her as I thought she was basically exploited. With very little in the way of material to work with she is reduced to spending most of the first half of the film just being, well, sexy! At times she seems to be trying to bring out emotions and conflicts in her character and I thought 'she's got something here' but she was let down by a script that was more interested in where the next half-naked girl was coming from as opposed to the inner workings of the characters. Hirsch is likable but just to wishy washy for my liking, but again the plot gives him little to work with. The two characters that the film does have fun with are Kelly and Eli and the two actors both have fun as a result. Olyphant is fun but it is Marquette that steals all his scenes  admittedly he has little competition but still. He is lively and funny and the extras on the DVD's are best when he is in character at the Adult Film conference. Dano is OK but is an easy geek, while the rest of the cast just plays jocks etc. Remar makes a brief appearance surrounded by lovely ladies and there are plenty of them  something that will keep the teenage boys happy  but the rest of us will probably wonder why we didn't just watch porn!<br/><br/>Overall this is a pretty poor film but it has just about enough energy to be watchable in you are in a very undemanding mood. There are no actual laughs to be had and the rest of the film just tries to keep providing titillation every few minutes to cover the total lack of material. The characters are flat, the relationships pathetically drawn and I had stopped caring about the story long before the end. I wouldn't watch it again and I would not recommend it to anyone over the age of 15 or female."
"berko-1","1","7","16","4 May 2004"," bad film about a geek and there is also a female porn star
","To make it short, this was the worst movie I've seen in a long time; very predictable, in the end the geek turned into the school hero and became a millionaire? Not to forget, there is also a porn star who becomes his girl-friend, triggered his changes or the other way around and in the second half is only there to be the good looking part. This movie has no charm as Pretty Woman, no cool dialogues as e.g. Kill Bill 2 (even though it tries-squeeze the juice?) and the love story is lame (why would the porn queen go for the school boy-does this really change her life to the better?). If you're not 17 and dreaming of ... with a porn star I cannot recommend to watch this film."
"todd-339-156814","9","3","5","20 February 2019"," Elisha Cuthbert is stunning and I can't seem to stop watching this film
","I watched The Girl Next Door for the first time about a week ago. I've watched it probably 6 times since. (Well, not all of it...just every damn scene Danielle is in). I gave the movie 9 stars but it's probably not that good. It's difficult to gauge because I am so hopelessly distracted by and in love with Elisha Cuthbert's Danielle. Every single second she is in it is absolute gold. It is without a doubt the hottest female character created in the history of film and one of the most underrated performances I've ever seen by an actress. Danielle is the perfect woman. An ex-porn star looking to turn her life around that falls for a nice guy that is the opposite of the guys she's probably been with. What guy hasn't fantasized about the perfect scenario?<br/><br/>So Elisha is hot. That's obvious. She's flawless at this point in her career. But a lot of credit goes to the director for shooting her in a way where every guy in the world watching her will fall in love with her. Make no mistake, this isn't about just some 10/10 girl in a film looking hot. It's the perfect girl created perfectly by an outstanding actress at the peak of her incredible beauty. Elisha does so much with the role that is somewhat passive and subtle. Everyone talks about the ""Do you wanna F+++ me"" and the usual scenes, but there's so much else she does right. The way she kisses his hand when they're dancing at the prom. The way she says, near tears, ""I would love to"" when he asks her to the prom. Her extreme sadness when he takes her to the hotel room. ""So this is what you think of me"". It's all so perfectly done by Elisha Cuthbert. Her facial expressions, her eyes. I'm mesmerized. I know I am not alone. I have read comments on various forums, YouTube, etc. It's an inexplicable feeling many seem to have. I feel great while watching it, but feel kind of sad and depressed when I'm done. I call this affliction Elishatism. ;-) The last couple times I have watched it I actually cried, and I never cry---and it's so hard to put into words what it is.. I guess I would best describe it as this feeling of seeing something/someone so perfect, so beautiful, so flawless, but knowing its not attainable or real. I have become obsessed with a fictional character that is 14 years old. It's totally nuts. Knowing I'm not alone is helpful though.<br/><br/>
Oh the film? This is not just another teen sex comedy. This film has outstanding acting and an amazing genuine ""feel"" to it where you feel like you're watching a genuine realistic romance unfold, but it probably doesn't deserve 9 stars. There's a lot done very well but a lot wrong with it. The most frustrating and excruciating thing wrong is that after about halfway through, Danielle's screen time disappears. The greatest asset this film has is Elisha's Danielle.<br/><br/>The plot line with Spoilers: Danielle falls for Matthew an average high school senior, who's got a great heart, but hasn't lived life. Matthew is played perfectly by Emile Hirsch, who deserves a lot of credit, but is completely overshadowed by Elisha Cuthbert. The romance happens, then he discovers she''s a porn star, screws up by treating her like a porn star, she runs away, he goes and saves her, she comes back. This is only halfway through the film at this point. The romance was extremely rushed. The last half of this film is where it goes totally sideways. There's a lot of stuff happening that centers more on Matthew, with Danielle just watching and cheering him on. I would have loved to see the romance build slowly throughout the film with a lot more development of Danielle's character. Where did she come from? Why a porn star? What is with her family or parents? None of that is explored. She's just this mysterious beautiful porn star. There's so mush more that could have been done surrounding her character, their romance, etc.<br/><br/>Elisha Cuthbert is fantastic with what the script gives her. The first half she's assertive in a really hot way, kind of taking control of Matthew, and showing him how to live life. After Matthew has brought her back from Vegas, the character of Danielle begins to morph into someone very sweet and vulnerable. You see how in love with Matthew she is and she seems to be a bit more submissive. The best word is vulnerable. You see that side of her in the end in many ways<br/><br/>When Danielle and Matthew finally have sex, I think there's a subtle thing going on in that Danielle is having sex for the first time with someone she cares about. Her facial expressions show me that she's feeling things she's never felt. It's really beautiful in my eyes and Elisha did such an amazing job with that..Again, that's the agonizing part of this film. There's so much done right, and so many great scenes, and great lines, but there's so many flaws and God I wish they took advantage of Elisha Cuthbert's performance more. Elisha, thank you for this performance. A lot of us appreciate it for the depth that I think you were going for. You are a star and you're beautiful. This film is a treasure because of you"

But it is instead that wrapped around an idea that while old is the hottest thing among Hollywood: folded narrative. Often this is called reflection and it focuses on films about films.<br/><br/>In this case, the 'outer' film is your regular John Hughes piffle: gaggle of nerds and a beauty. Incredibly dumb adults. One wild card weasel. <br/><br/>But inside that movie is another one, about movie-making and the oft-cited issue of performers being prostitutes. In these two regards, the movie is like 'Moulin Rouge.'<br/><br/>But here, the joke is on the other side, the heroine 'prostitute' escapes the movie, while the innocent boyfriend dives in and succeeds. The manner of how this is presented suits the subject matter: most of it is told in narration from the POV of the hero, and many small films-within are presented by us 'seeing' his imagination.<br/><br/>I'm increasingly convinced that there is more intelligence in the Hollywood writer's community than the genres (and the commercial pressures that constrain them) permit.

There are plenty of twists in the plot along the way, and there are excellent supporting performances from Timothy Olyphant, James Remar, Chris Marquette and Paul Dano.<br/><br/>The movie can get slightly unbelievable at times, but there are plenty of laugh out loud moments to keep you riveted.

"Ronin47","7","5","11","8 June 2004"," Should be a lot better, but it's alright (***)
","This is one of those times that the 3-star rating is mainly a sentimental one. There are many moments in ""The Girl Next Door"", mainly in its first half, that capture that awesome 80's-ness of the best teen comedies of the 80's, but at the same time it's not nearly as good as it should (and easily could) be. <br/><br/>Obviously heavily inspired by the 1983 Tom Cruise teen classic ""Risky Business"" (even the score mimics the ""Risky Business"" score at key moments), it's about an ambitious but indifferent high school senior named Matthew (Emile Hirsch, ""The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys"") whose comfortable world is thrown into disarray when the stunningly beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, from TV's ""24"") moves in next door. <br/><br/>They strike up a relationship the kind of way that you only see in the movies, but it's very entertaining (and like ""Risky Business"", it's more about teenage wish-fulfillment than reality), so I didn't mind. Then things get complicated when Matt learns, through his porn-addicted friend Eli (the hilarious Chris Marquette), that Danielle is a porn star.<br/><br/>
In the first half, ""The Girl Next Door"" is a lot of fun. It's well-paced, interesting, funny, and the soundtrack keeps throwing great songs at you. Unfortunately, the second half is dragged down quite a bit by the unnecessary addition of several non-entertaining subplots and characters that distract from what the movie should be about: Matthew's sexual awakening. <br/><br/>Still, even though I almost stuck it with a **1/2, there are just enough good scenes and great songs to get a somewhat-shaky but solid recommendation from me. After all, any movie that makes good use of ""Under Pressure"" by Queen and David Bowie AND The Who's ""Baba O'Riley"" (two of my all-time favorite songs) will probably get my vote."

","I am an honest guy and I got to admit that when I originally watched this film back on the 4th of April 2011, I was expecting a graphic sexual comedy with the unique goal of displaying nudity and gratuitous sex to a teenage masculine audience... was I so ever wrong. Unfortunately, that is the way it was marketed back in 2003-4 (I remember seeing this movie being advertised on television when I was ten years old and all I could retain from the commercials was the possible high amount of sexual content in it!).<br/><br/>This is my first review. I was always tempted to do one, but I never found a film that sufficiently inspired me to do so... until now. I have never been so attached to a character before. The script is surprisingly deep (compared to what I really expected) and the comedic sequences are well inserted in the film without making them appear unnecessary or awkward. The best part about this movie is that everything ends on a optimistic mood. No bad feelings of revenge or of any other sort. There are no losers: it's a real feel good movie.<br/><br/>Among the reviews that I have seen, a lot of people gave the film a 10/10. I usually reserve those for serious and thought provoking movies such as American History X, Fight Club, Dark Night, just to name a few; however, it definitely does not deserve a 6.8/10 either. I give it a 7.5-7.7/10, especially after watching it a second time (The first time I watched this I couldn't fall asleep after because I couldn't believe how flipping good it was).<br/><br/>This is not an objective sophisticated review like I sometimes see for some movies.

And most of all, thinking of ways to make that awesome SENIOR YEAR last. TGND highlights all these concepts in this amazing hour and a half movie. Ms.Cuthbert is mesmerizing as the famous porn star Danielle aka Athena. The lead guy also gives an amazing performance along with his two friends.

"BA_Harrison","7","2","3","7 November 2009"," The Girl Nexxxt Door.
","If you've seen the 1983 Tom Cruise sex comedy Risky Business, then you'll no doubt get a strong sense of deja-vu whilst watching The Girl Next Door, for the plot is almost identical, albeit slightly tweaked in places and updated for today's audiences: where Tom Cruise's preppy Joel Goodsen fell in love with a hot hooker, Emile Hirsch's Matthew Kidman hooks up with hot porn star Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert); Risky Business's sleazy antagonist, Guido the killer pimp, becomes adult film producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant); instead of having the contents of his parents house stolen, Matthew loses a $25,000 fund for foreign student Samnang; and rather than running a brothel to recoup his losses, Matthew and his geeky pals decide to use their new contacts in the adult film biz to turn their luck around.<br/><br/>However, despite screaming 'rip-off' at every turn, it's very hard not to enjoy this film. Director Luke Greenfield handles his material well and the appealing cast all do a great job: Hirsch is perfect as uptight Matthew who eventually learns to cut loose (to paraphrase Joel Goodsen, 'Sometimes you just gotta say 'What the fk!!'); Elisha Cuthbert is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and oozes sensuality (although she doesn't get nekkid, which is a real shame!); Olyphant is brilliant as he effortlessly switches between charming rogue and utterly menacing villain; and Chris Marquette impresses as Matthew's film-student pal Eli (is it just me, or is this guy a dead ringer for a young John Cusack?).<br/><br/>The Girl Next Door does suffer a little during it's more emotional scenes, which lack conviction, but these less effective moments are easily counterbalanced by the film's genuinely funny moments that capitalise well on the film's lewd premise, including Matthew imagining Danielle getting it on with his parents, a fracas at an adult film convention in Las Vegas, and Matthew's run in with a friend of the family at a lap-dancing club.<br/><br/>Although The Girl Next Door is far from original, and never reaches the levels of perfection achieved by Cruise and Co. (let's face it, Risky Business is a classic of the genre and a very hard act to follow), it passes the time well enough, offering some quality eye candy for us blokes, a bit of mushy, sentimental, lovey-dovey pap for the ladies, a decent pop/rock soundtrack, and a heartwarming outcome for all of its characters."
"victor_a_lau","10","2","3","10 October 2009"," An obscene and indecent movie. Really??
","After watching this amazing movie with Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch probably 5 or 6 times, I decided to do some research about its beginnings.<br/><br/>I found comments ranging from disgusting and unappealing to charming and sexy. But, what is the truth behind one of the most controversial teen movies of all time?? Here it goes: First, my point of view of this movie(as you can see in my vote) is that it is a success. 4 nominations? Not a lot of movies get that many. But what I really want to discuss in this movie is the subjective and most symbolic aspects. This kind of movies may be found obscene and unpleasant, but once you watch this one, your opinion about teen movies with sexual themes is going to change.<br/><br/>Lets look at the life of Danielle. Ex-porn star at just the age of 19, and now she wants to change her life. But, of course, most juveniles her age have seen or heard about a movie she has been part of. I can only imagine how difficult it is for somebody like her to get someone in her life, moreover for love life. So, let's look at it this way, she is looking for a second chance, nobody would give a single try, but there is always someone, that special person that in the end, appears in your life. And that is when Matthew Kidman comes in. This high school senior geek lives a boring life in school, never getting the chance to live the fullest. He finds her, and both receive a 180 degree turn to their lives. This girl is just beautiful, charismatic and loving. She finds herself getting the chance she wanted and enjoying being a new person, all because of the help of Matthew. Great love story.<br/><br/>Now, lets go for Matthew. Shy, geeky, but also smart, charismatic and devoted to his cause, this high school senior with aspirations to a scholarship to Georgetown University gets a whole twist in his life when Danielle comes in. Now, he finds himself struggling with his emotions and feelings. But in the end, he knows what is best to do, and that is to give it all for the girl that changed his life and made him a happier and most sociable person. He loves her from the first time, and the way he fights for the love of Danielle is just unbelievable, even risking his chances to go to college. That is what if call moral fiber.<br/><br/>Forgiveness, I believe, is what would describe what is happening in this film, and a second chance to the lives of two completely different youths who needed each other to find their inner selves. Love, true friendship, and lots of devotion are also the greatest aspects of this movie. Sacrificing what you think is right, to do the RIGHT thing for that special person.<br/><br/>So really, why do we settle for less, why try something new for one time. The experience will change our point of view. The Girl Next Door is one of the GREATEST titles about love, friendship and devotion(once again this three) of all time.<br/><br/>And of course, in the end, when you watch it, enjoy it, and see the most inner and philosophical point of view, you know the juice was worth the squeeze"
"poweruserx83","10","2","3","4 October 2007"," Incredible- One of the best ever- And grossly underrated
","This is one of my all time favorite movies (probably my favorite actually)- Apart from the fact that Elisha captures your mind and the movie makes you feel that you've done way too little 'nuts stuff' in your life- It is fantastically made, excellent performances all around and a GREAT story.<br/><br/>This movie is a master piece- I've watched it like maybe 20 times. I've not done that with any other movie. Oh, and if you're a guy and have never seen Elisha before (not in this way anyway) she'll most likely take over your mind for the next few weeks. But it too shall pass (but it won't completely go). :)"
"laymonite-2","10","2","3","26 August 2007"," Completely unexpected good hearted rom-com
","I was kind of fooled by the marketing of this but it sounded intriguing anyway and I'd learned the lesson that seemingly gross out comedies like American Pie, Old School and The 40 Year Old Virgin can actually be good fun and have a lot more going for them.<br/><br/>Do NOT think this is some kind of gross out or tasteless low brow comedy, despite the unfortunate marketing and apparent subject matter. In fact if anything it struck me as a very well crafted old fashioned romantic film at heart (in a good way). This is really probably not the film you think it is.<br/><br/>High points. The cast is excellent, absolutely all on top form for every character. The direction, photography and use of music are top notch - everything seems to hit the right note perfectly. You start out thinking you'll see a crass comedy and end up seeing a very skillfully made film, with likable characters and a really good heart at the core of it. It's also extremely funny! Low points. It's very much a fantasy film and very romantic. In this sense it really doesn't touch on it's supposed core theme 'the porn industry' in any realistic way. Porn producers are lovable rogues. AIDS is never mentioned. The whole thing is so wholesome! I don't really think this is a low point as the film is essentialy a romantic fantasy and the portrayal of the porn characters is very funny and in no way meant to be realistic.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it."

","This is certainly one of the best teen love stories I have seen. All the actors played parts beautifully, especially the protagonists, Hirsch, Cuthbert and Olyphant and the movie keeps you glued to your sit till the end.<br/><br/>This is the story of matthew(Hirsch) who doesn't know how to have fun in his life. Matthew is the college president and is about to graduate and then 'she' enters his life and changes everything. Danielle(Cuthbert) moves in into the neighbourhood of Matthew and Matthew falls for her the moment he sees her. Then he finds out that Danielle is in fact a pornstar but he is so much in love with her that he does everything that he can to get her. Will he succeed? And if he does, at what cost?<br/><br/>One of the weird things about this movie is that Cuthbert plays a pornstar and we don't even get to see her full frontal but her sheer beauty makes up for it to an extent. Another thing this movie failed to do was that it never digs into the past life of Danielle as to how and why did she became a pornstar.<br/><br/>All in all, I think there are more pluses to this movie than minuses. If you like teen love stories then you'll surely like this one too."

"wannasurf2","6","2","3","1 January 2007"," worth watching
","Yes, this does feel like a formula 80's teen movie - as if the screenplay was shelved in 1984 and put together recently with only slight adaption. Some may criticize this, but other will revel in it. The whole time while watching the movie, I got Risky Business flashbacks. Even some of the scenes and music had that feel to it, but with a comedic feel almost...as if it was done intentionally. Naturally the movie has the stereotypes played to a T - the nerd pack, jocks, etc, but the bad guy (porn producer) was an interesting character, although this character while surely remind you of the pimp in Risky Business, no doubt...hmmm. Regardless, it is entertaining, and worth watching. Sure, it isn't a John Hughes movie, but one of the better teen movies I have seen the past couple years - or at least since 10 Things I Hate About You. The bottom line - if you are a sucker for ""another teen movie"" as I typically am, then I recommend this one."
"whpratt1","7","2","3","30 December 2006"," Lots of Fun Film
","This was a great entertaining film with plenty of action and lots of laughs. Emile Hirsch, ""Lords of Dogtown"", plays the role of a very bright high school student and even President of his class, however, he was still not popular with most of the guys and gals of his senior class. Elisha Cuthbert, ""House of Wax"", moves next door to Emile and gives him a free show of her body from her bedroom window and then proceeds to visit his home and asks for help getting to know the town and its hot spots. Elish did not tell Emile that she was a former porno star and poor Emile was still a virgin and very shy trying to put the make on sexy Elisha. Elisha Cuthbert has really grown up since her performance in ""24"" TV Series and is a beautiful young up and coming gal."

At first I figured the only good thing about this movie would be to see some good old fashion teenage T&A. After seeing this movie I saw it for what it really was, a vessel for carrying a strong message. That message is to live life for life, and to leave nothing untested or undone. There are points where time is lost and you get the feeling that it looses its flow, but it quickly recovers and at the end delivers a come from nowhere knockout sucker punch. I am now proud to say that I own this movie and watch it regularly. I will say it's go a lot going for it, good looking women, good music, and a good story."

","This love story is a typical one but with a different perspective from the director and the story teller. There are so many stories with a man falling in love with a hooker done but this one with a porn star is the kindest of them all. Something that makes us understand a relation between two humans much better than just a commercial venture. Something sweet. After all it shows that we humans are not what we are made out to be but just kind at heart like everyone. Its the circumstances that make us what we are. But the basic characteristic remains the same. I would recommend this movie for people who are in those precious moments of loneliness..."

","I turned to HBO to find that the Girl Next Door was just starting, so i decided to watch it, and I have to say it has been a long time since i have watched such an appealing and affable movie. Due to the way it was marketed, before I watched it it made me think it would be a big striptease movie, but it really just was not that. I found myself becoming attached to the two main characters Matthew and Danielle, as if I had always known them. They are both especially appealing actors in this ""not so much for children"" comedy. It does not matter if it was good or not, I simply found myself content and satisfied when it finished like I never had been before, and I am not a sucker for romantic peachy movies as this one may be marketed as, in fact I don't even watch many romantic comedies.

","Sadly this movie is centered around the pornography industry and therefore tries to promote their own self interests.  Hollywood using another movie to try and justify all the sex and profanity it likes to push off on the American public and call it art.  Instead of portraying the porn industry and it leaders as the sleeze balls they are who pray on young women, it makes them out to look like honorable people with a heart for others. Take out the nudity, the profanity, and change the scenario around a little and this could have been a really good movie.  I would hope parents will keep their teenagers away from this movie and send a message to Hollywood.  The most popular movies ever made that grossed the most income were not movies of this type.  When will movie producers ever get that?"

The characters were attractive ranging from the usual suburban high school cliques to adult film producers and starlets. Eroticism and high school graduation, as a pair, always attracted attention, and this movie capitalized on this taboo reality. Having these polarized yet ancillary characters made most of this movie's humor based on the novelty of the friendships. This movie definitely illustrated the quiet kinkiness lurking in high school academics while addressing issues of moral sexual behavior. American Pie and She's All That each made boundaries within which this movie operated."

Its got smart dialogue, and overall a very good script. The acting i thought was pretty good for some unknown casting. I always hated how in teen comedy movies, the characters in highschool were played by people in their mid 20's and looked nothing like regular high school kids. But in this movie, the high school kids look pretty realistic to real life. Of course like any other movie it has its faults. Just when u thought the movie was ending, something always occured to make the story last longer. It wasn't a bad thing but it happen a couple times.

","I didn't expect anything out of this movie, and that was perhaps why I think it was simply great. The wonderful soundtrack helped to gel a decently well thought of plot that carried so much nostalgia with it. The best was perhaps the beginning yearbook picture scene, the director made a great attempt at capturing the audience's memories of the past. I actually thought the chemistry between the two leads were wonderful compared to other teen movies, it reminded me of the high school romances, and made me yearn for what they had. The ending was the only thing that was not up to par, because it is simply too perfect. Of course that's what everyone wants to see but I thought the scene with him in the Z4 and seeing Elisha was too too too perfect. Maybe I'm jealous, but this was a great movie"
"clarkkent179","9","1","1","29 March 2004"," Different - and better - than I expected
","I really enjoyed this film.  I was fortunate enough to see it a couple of weeks ago at a sneak preview, and I was surprised at how much better it was than I had originally anticipated.  The initial marketing, to me, did not do the content of the film justice.  I expected a raunchy teen comedy along the lines of American Pie, Road Trip, or Eurotrip, but The Girl Next Door had a lot more heart and concern for the characters than any of those other films.<br/><br/>
Granted, it has its weak moments - I WISH someone like Danielle would move in next door and instantly be drawn to me like she was with Matt - but no one's claiming this will be an Oscar contender - and it doesn't try to be. It is a sweet story showing how a worldly-experienced, yet not-quite confident young woman brings a sort-of sheltered, naive young man out of his shell, with both of them benefiting from things they learn from each other.<br/><br/>I hope this movie has good word-of-mouth appeal for audiences, since it does have a good cast, a good soundtrack, and a cheesy-but-sweet story.  I highly recommend that individuals see it for themselves before making an opinion based on critics' summaries - it's definitely worth the price of admission."

It looked like your average t&a movie from the trailer I had seen, but my friend convinced me to go because she said it was like a modern day ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" As if it were one thousandth as good as Fast Times! From beginning to end, this movie is ridiculous. The kid is a total geek, and it's completely unbelievable that a hottie ex-porn queen would even spend three minutes in his puppydog slobbering presence. When her sleazy agent (or is it pimp?????) or whatever he is (it's not fully explained), the story takes an even sillier turn, as it is up to the Geek Next Door to save her from going back into the porn industry. This spells a road trip for him and his dork buddy-but they forget they are in Connecticut and somehow end up driving to Vegas in time to make it to school the next day. More asinine capers ensue, none of which are fully explained and insult the viewers' intelligence.<br/><br/>The movie is amateurishly filmed and a waste of Elisha Cuthbert's talent. As viewers of 24 know, she's more than just a pretty face-but this movie objectifies her. The script seems as if it were written by a horny 14 year old who fantasizes about the women he looks at in his porno mags and internet sites. A major waste of celluloid trash."

","I have to admit, when I finished watching this, I was not entirely sure if I had seen a good or a bad movie. I thought maybe the incoherent, surreal, nonsensical lack of a story was intentional, that maybe this was multilayered and deep and I missed the symbolism or something. I thought about it for a good, long, hard 10 seconds, then decided that no, it was just trash. I mean, sometimes it can take hard work to make a movie this weird, but I'm pretty sure this was by accident.<br/><br/>Let me put it to you this way: if you were amused by the phrase ""long, hard 10 seconds"" in the above paragraph, you will think this movie is a classic. Actually, no, you probably won't. You will be disappointed because there is no nudity. That's right: a movie about porn stars and the porn industry, and that condones porn as a good thing, has NO NUDITY. What the hell kind of message is THAT sending? I'm not even going to bother explaining the plot, because there is none. There's about a thousand different climaxes (haha, I said climaxes), and the movie contradicts its own attitude toward porn even more times than that. If you can make sense out of this mess, consider yourself a genius (or an idiot. I'm not sure).<br/><br/>Other users have mentioned the movie's depiction of Asians is ""borderline racist."" I think the word they're looking for is ""downright,"" not borderline. Here's a true story: when I was 12, I started taking a tally on how many American comedies attempt to get laughs out of minorities swearing in goofy accents. Including this movie, that number has now surpassed 5 trillion (and the only time it has ever been funny was in ""Office Space""). Anyway, if you think an Asian kid wearing huge glasses and talking like Elmer Fudd is high comedy, this is the movie for you. If, however, you are not a racist dumbass, you'll want to avoid ""The Girl Next Door,"" and stick to something a little more watchable, like ""Manos: Hands of Fate."""

","This movie isn't very real but emotions portrayed are. Film is about a teenager (Emile) who will be soon high school graduated and looking for scholarship for which he is preparing from long. One fine day, he saw a absolutely gorgeous neighbour (Elisha) who popped in suddenly to next-door and do some striping act for him. Consequences lead him to her and then story moved fwd showcasing today's high school life, beginning and breaking of emotions, teen friendship and how easily teen can be influenced. I am not going to tell you the story or plot as I just loved the naturalness in it and though it definitely not the unique one, it certainly more thrilling to get to see it without any expectation or information.<br/><br/>Director Luke Greenfield has done good job and developed characters effectively. Especially Emile and Elisha. Both have good talent and will heading for good future. Elisha has some resemblance with Natalie Portman especially the way she smiles but will sure make niche for herself soon. All support cast has done some good job as well especially Timothy Olyphant who played porn movie producer.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend the movie as must watch especially for people who love simple movies with real emotions though sometimes become awkward to watch but you enjoy them for their true portrayal. Uncut version M not sure is there some cur version or not) is strictly not to be watch with Kids or parents as contains some graphic nudity and mature content.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

","Two young performers (Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) make this formulaic coming-of-age comedy worth watching. While the style of the film was screwball comedy, Hirsch and Cuthbert delivered effective naturalistic performances, avoiding the clichés of so many of the ""over-the-top"" Hollywood farces geared to the teen audience. The early scenes of the film were especially touching in the innocence and sweetness captured by the two performers. It is there that the love relationship begins to develop and where both Hirsch and Cuthbert shine in their roles. Another good performance is by Timothy Olyphant as the sassy, smooth-talking con artist and film producer. The film as a whole is filled with stupid, juvenile scenes and antics, especially the trip to Las Vegas. But the three principal actors made the film enjoyable and even memorable."

We have to assume that a girl who makes a living wiping DNA off her face is very together and desirable. We have to believe that a boy's parents approve of his porn interests. We have to believe that a pornographic sex infomercial tape was bought by every high school in the country to show in health ed. class even though it contains full nudity.

"jyinyang","Null","5","14","22 January 2004"," Who's the target audience for this R-rated teenybopper film?
","Saw it at a preview screening here in San Francisco last night.  Overall, this movie seemed like an attempt to capitalize on the success of teenybopper romantic comedies but with an added dose of boob-age to warrant an ""R"" rating, both a ""chick flick"" and ""dick flick"", if you will.  The story does seem to drag on though, as the characters manage to get into one predicament after another, with the occasional obstacle coming out of left field, making the movie less fluid.  Each new obstacle seemed calculated to elicit laughs and cringing at the same time.  The Asian stereotype jokes got old pretty fast and the movie seemed like a throwback of the John Hughes-era films, where a majority of the students are White with the occasional token person of color thrown in.  However, the casting was enjoyable, and even Matthew's parents were fun.  Bottom line, less in-your-face than the ""American Pie"" series but still probably only worth a movie rental, at the most."
"aimless-46","3","3","7","15 May 2005"," Strictly for the Those with Low Brain Activity
","There is a movie viewer segment of such limited intelligence that they have never been able to experience a movie that actually insulted their intelligence. I understand that ""The Girl Next Door"" was made as a public service to these viewers and deliberately featured a screenplay so dumbed-down that even those just slightly above the moron level could have their first-ever intelligence insulting viewing experience.<br/><br/>Start with a mix of ""Risky Business"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"", extract all elements of charm that characterized those films, and then dumb-down the story as a public service to the brain-activity challenged members of the audience; and you have a good description of ""The Girl Next Door"".<br/><br/>But it sure has a nice promotional poster. Elisha Cuthbert looks good posing and she does a decent job playing Elisha Cuthbert (who just happens to be ""The Girl Next Door""), but her range as an actress is too narrow to even be measured. Unfortunately for Cuthbert, ""This"" girl next door (a part most talented young ""actresses"" would love to play) is supposed to be a multi-dimensional character (for those in the target audience this means that the character is really two different people: ""a girl next door"" and a ""young but hardened by experience porn star""). If you have seen the movie and are still confused don't be embarrassed, nothing in Cuthbert's performance would lead anyone to believe she is a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". That is because Cuthbert herself is not a ""young but hardened by experience porn star"". She would have to ""act"" differently than ""the girl next door"" to communicate this dimensionality to the audience. To do this she would have to be an ""actress"".<br/><br/>So give Cuthbert credit for being able to pose for pictures and for being herself-she seems like a very nice girl that I would welcome as my neighbor. For some people that is enough, for those busy with the experience of having their intelligence insulted for the first time it is probably not important. The rest of us we would be hard pressed to find a worse way to spend our time."
"MovieAddict2016","8","3","7","21 July 2004"," Are we back in the '80s?
","""The Girl Next Door"" is one of 2004's most entertaining movies -- sweet, crude; funny, sad; moralistic, filthy. Uneven mixtures of opposites attract, much like the leading stars of the film, for a movie that delights the audience at every turn. It manages to satirize the teen comedy genre whilst exploiting it. This is raunchier than ""American Pie"" and yet also far more sophisticated.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsche plays Matthew Kidman, a 19-year-old high school senior who hasn't lived life to the fullest during his pre-graduation phase. While fellow schoolmates skip school to go party at the beach, Matthew sits in class, gazing outside at the partying teens, wishing he could be like them.<br/><br/>Then the girl next door moves in: Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a drop-dead-gorgeous blonde beauty who undresses across the street from Matthew as he watches in his bedroom. She spots him peeking at her, then plays cruel revenge tricks on him, and then eventually falls in love with him because ""of the way he looked at her.""<br/><br/>She is touched by Matthew's honesty because she is a former porn star (at the age of 19) and is not used to receiving true affection. When Matthew finds out about her background he is mad, then happy, jumping at the opportunity to sleep with Danielle. Danielle feels betrayed and rushes off to Las Vegas for an adult film star convention. Matthew follows her and tries to ""get her back"" as so many heroes always do, but falls out with Danielle's producer, Kelly (played perfectly by Timothy Olyphant).<br/><br/>The movie eventually tackles a number of subplots -- Matthew learning to ""go with it"" and loosen up; Danielle abandoning her past and looking forward to the future; a Cambodian genius being transferred to Matthew's school; Kelly and Matthew's falling out; Matthew's college scholarship, etc. The film juggles all these different ideas, managing to maintain the audience's interest.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a bit raunchy at times and the subject matter is probably inappropriately handled in some scenes. However, the core message of the film is beautiful. It's hidden underneath an unfortunate layer of smut that nevertheless fails to harm the film in any way.<br/><br/>Obviously inspired by the teen films of the 1980s, such as ""Risky Business"" and the plethora of John Hughes-produced/directed flicks, ""The Girl Next Door"" even boasts a great soundtrack that complements the nature of the film. <br/><br/>The acting is one of the movie's most surprising elements -- Hirsche and Cuthbert share chemistry, despite the fact that their two-year age different in real life is quite obvious (Cuthbert looks much older). That's sorta the point, though. Cuthbert is absolutely beautiful, but people wandering into the theater hoping to see her nude should look elsewhere. ""The Girl Next Door"" is better than that -- an honest and touching teen comedy that cares for its characters and studies them carefully. When Matthew and Danielle finally share a love scene it is handled with tenderness, something rare in movies like this.<br/><br/>""The Girl Next Door"" is a teen comedy for adults.<br/><br/>4/5."

","The Girl Next Door is one of the most unrealistic movies I've ever seen. It's less realistic than The Exorcist and it makes less sense than Yellow Submarine. Once I got past that though - and it took some effort - and tried to enjoy it for what it is, I found out it's not a bad movie, either.<br/><br/>Even when it tries to pretend to have a message or a point, and it unfortunately does, The Girl Next Door should be taken for entertainment purposes only, and as such, it's pretty entertaining. It's never laugh out loud funny, but it has some humorous moments, some good acting (no, not Elisha Cuthbert... but Tim Olyphant is great, and young Emile Hirsch already shows some talent) and surprisingly, the humor is much less broad and crude than most other teen comedies of its time. In fact, The Girl Next Door, shockingly, is almost family friendly, and its overall attitude is more positive and idealistic than you would possibly imagine. Not that anyone would want to watch it with their family, mind you. The movie has a pretty limited appeal - it probably won't be that attractive to anyone but the 15-21 year old male demographic. But you shouldn't be concerned if your kids watch this, either. The Girl Next Door is one of the more conservative, cheerful, feel good comedies of the 00's."

","We just saw a sneak preview of this movie, which is due to be released in mid-March.<br/><br/>A shy idealistic young man named Matthew (Emile Hirsch), who gets into Georgetown about a month before graduating from high school, is nonetheless suffering from the lack of excitement in his life.  All that will change when he gets caught sneaking a pick at his sultry next-door neighbor Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), who just happens to be a porn star trying to quit the business.  They quickly fall in love and Danielle takes Matthew for a wild ride that teaches him  that ""sometimes you just got to say what the f**k!""<br/><br/>This is clearly a rather poor remake of the 1983 picture Risky Business, which featured Tom Cruise and very young and breathtaking Rebecca De Mornay. This new version does not stand up to Risky Business in terms of either the story or cinematography and Elisha Cuthbert is no match for Rebecca De Mornay.  Where De Mornay's character was sexy, sophisticated, and real, Cuthbert's character does not extend much beyond her good looks.  At times, I was made with the director of this movie for trying to remake a very good movie and screwing up royally.  The scene between Matthew and Danielle in the limo (a cheap and uninspired knockoff of the De Mornay-Cruise scene in the Chicago subway) was just atrocious.<br/><br/>To be fair, this movie has a few very funny moments, and the actors playing Kelly (Danielle's producer) and Eli (Matthew's friend Eli) did a great job. But there are simply not enough funny moments in that movie to justify spending two hours of your life watching it."

","This one is so much like your normal chic lit romcom type in the beginning but picks up as we approach the half way mark. Emile Hirsch could get an 'A' for his acting. He also has a couple of friends and the three of them insist on calling themselves as 'tripod' and rightly so, as this film is held up partly because of the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' sort of friendship they exhibit. This film also tacitly touches upon the concept of true love and standing up for it when it's called for. Elisha Cuthbert exhibits a different level of grace altogether in this movie and was the sole motivator for me to watch this movie in the first place. And last but not least, this movie gives guys the message to fight for their girl when it's due and also gives them hope that anything can be achieved when she's by their side."

","Please do not confuse this movie for the life of porn star Stacy Valentine feature from the same year. This is mainstream comedy movie that stars Emilie Hirsh and Elisha Cuthbert. The film is about a high school student who discovers that a porn star has moved in next door to him. They become friends which leads to a serious relationship. However it is only a matter of time until her porn film producer friend bumps in to her again and attempts to come between the two. The film follows the same route as many previous love stories. Unfortunately the film doesn't shed much light on the porn industry and is neither a biography of any sort. There are many comic moments that display the humour side of the business. Towards the the second half the film ventures in to 'risky Business 1983' terrority. As a matter of fact the film almost seems like a duplicate of the 80s movie. The only difference seems that Rebecca De Mornay was a prostitute.<br/><br/>Good light hearted fun and Timothy Olyphant is the heart of the movie. He manages to be funny in a serious way. And Cuthbert is attractive."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","0","0","21 November 2015"," Raunchy antics with heart and unusual gravity
","The Girl Next Door dressed itself up in a bubblegum marketing campaign of American Pie- esque ditziness as well as a promise of sleaze, lowbrow humour and good old fashioned brain dead teen sex comedy sluttiness. Couldn't have subverted expectations more than it did. Don't get me wrong, a whole lot of it is exactly what I just said it wasn't in my first sentence above, but alongside that that super crude, millennial carnality is a story with a head and heart in either hand, and it's mind in the right place. A silly, eye rolling sex- scapade no doubt, but one with well drawn characters, a terrific script, and a wonderful sense of bawdy fun that calls to mind the comforting nostalgia of a National Lampoon flick, married with the off colour tinge of a 60's sex comedy. Nnever does it lose sight of the feelings, struggles and desires of its two lead actors. Emilie Hirsch is equally vulnerable and gutsy as Matthew, a high school introvert with no experience in the realm of all things female. He's tantalized by his new neighbour Danielle, an ex porn star played by Elisha Cuthbert. Cuthbert has never been as good as she was here (not even playing Jack Bauer's daughter) or as goddamn sexy. She balances a tricky role that could have easily strayed into easy titillation with laid back reactions and down to earth charm that carries the movie. She's amused by naive Matthew, eventually attracted, and ultimately smitten. Matthew learns that lust is only skin deep and real attraction comes from stuff like eye contact and conversation, and that sex is only something special when one knows who one is with to begin with. Nice little allegory for eager beaver male youth, and a pearl of wisdom I really wish I was privy to at his age. Trouble arrives in the form of Danielle's horrendously captivating ex boyfriend, porn director Kelly, played with slick acid tongued alpha male sleaze by irresistible Timothy Olyphant, looking like Hugh Hefner had a kid with Wolverine, before he took up the mantle of Raylan Givens. You see, Danielle clearly believes she's no better than a career as a porn actress, and it takes the simple devotion of Matthew, a high school nebbish who has learned to see her as more than just an Old Milwaukee pinup girl at the end of the rainbow, but as the genuine object of his affections, to convince her otherwise. The fact that such a touching arc for both of them exists in such a loud and proud gross out sex romp of a comedy is proof of life from both writer, director and cast alike. This is a fun flick too, every character a whip smart, realistic depiction of people we've all met in our post growing up exploits. Matthew's two hapless high school chums are priceless, payed by a hyperactive, horndog Chris Marquette and an awkward Paul Dano. James Remar, that old dog, shows up in a wink and nudge role as Danielle's hilarious ex boss, porn king Hugo Posh. The film's anchored by the unexpected substance hiding just below its apparently superfluous exterior shell. Plus, it's an absolutely hilarious, raunchy flick that will give you a boner, make you sopping wet with all kinds of bodily fluids, and put a big goofy grin on your face and make you let out a nice romantic sigh all at once. Sexy romantic comedy heaven."

","This movie is a romantic comedy about a porn star falling for a lad in high school. Ignoring the fact that this is usually regarded as borderline paedophilia, and ignoring the massive improbability of the central premise, this film tries to have it sweet cake and eat it despite its unsavouriness.<br/><br/>There is a hypocritical double standard at work here. The porn element, central to the plot, isn't actually present in the film at all ie. the film doesn't have the courage of the conviction which forms part of its foundation. And if the film doesn't believe in it enough to include sufficient of it to persuade the audience, why should the audience accept its credibility as part of its central conceit? Do be specific, Elisha Cuthbert is always attractive, always cute, always sexy, but never convinces as someone who has been a participant in the porn industry: she is entirely too wholesome.<br/><br/>And this is a shame, because it undermines a movie which features characters whose company is quite pleasing, and a script with some good moments in it."

Well I can say that I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this movie that is wasn't your typical high school flick. Yeah there was the gratuitous nudity but with a porn star as one of the leads that is inevitable. This movie had heart and soul, there were really good leads played well by all. Timothy Olyphant as the porn producer was the highlight of the movie for me at least, he hasn't been in too many movies where I actually liked his acting so that was definitely awesome to see one of my favorite television actors finally playing a good role. Emile Hirsch is one of my favorite young actors so I've been waiting to see this for a while , and he definitely didn't disappoint, totally different than any other role he has played.

Featuring the ""Adult Movie Industry"" as it does, the piece could so easily have been an excuse for garnering cheap sexy laughs out of flesh for fantasy situations, oh they are there for sure, but for every nerdy wet dream gag, we have it cloaked in intelligence of thought provoking interest.<br/><br/>Taking the lead female role, and positively oozing sexuality, is Elisha Cuthbert, wonderfully essaying the working girl who really does just see her profession as a means to an end, with true love seemingly passing her by. On top nerd form we have Emile Hirsch {Matthew}, Paul Dano and Chris Marquette, with Timmothy Olyphant doing a smashing weasel turn as a troublesome producer and ex boyfriend of Cuthbert. Bonus comes in cameo form from the ever watchable James Remar, for the ladies his thong wearing skit is of interest surely, for us blokes his sequences are comedic joy only! It's interesting looking at the respective careers of those involved, Cuthbert was the draw card here, yet she has gone on to become something of a C movie star, starring in such poor fare as Captivity. Whilst Hirsch has since wowed audiences in films like Into The Wild and Milk, while Dano of course featured heavily in the hugely successful There Will Be Blood. Sometimes it's obvious that beauty can only get you so far.<br/><br/>I personally really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons, so give it a try and you might just feel the same. 7/10"

","""Matt never saw her coming... but all his friends had!"" <br/><br/>Boy meets girl who's already met all sorts of boys and girls in this teen-slanted comedy. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight-laced and highly ambitious high school student who plans to study at Georgetown University and dreams of a career in politics. While most of his classmates are in the throes of an epidemic of senioritis, Matthew is obsessed with schoolwork and has a hard time relaxing and having fun. But he finds himself a bit less focused on his future career when Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a beautiful 19-year-old blonde, moves in next door. Danielle is playful, spontaneous, and doesn't always remember to draw her shades, and before long Matthew is head over heels in love. Danielle soon finds herself taken with Matthew as well, but their relationship takes an unusual turn when he discovers that, before she moved to town, Danielle had a successful career as a porn actress. Matthew is able to convince Danielle that she's cut out for better things in life than appearing in porn videos, but his advice doesn't especially please Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) or Hugo (James Remar), two porn moguls who figure Matthew owes them big-time after convincing their leading lady to drop out of the adult industry. The Girl Next Door -- which, appropriately enough, shares its title with a 1999 documentary about adult film superstar Stacy Valentine -- also features Timothy Bottoms, Paul Dano, and Chris Marquette.<br/><br/>Review The Girl Next Door is so full of clichés and just overloaded with cheesiness and yet, after all this I find it quite amusing. That isn't normal of me because I usually despise teeny bopper chick flicks (American Pie makes the cut among a few other classics) and surprisingly, this one makes it on top. Elisha Cuthbert exudes the eroticism and beauty of the character and yet, she didn't over do it, just the right mix. Emile Hirsch, a then unknown, equally shines as well."

","I saw this movie back in 2005. I had heard so much about it that I figured I might as well see it. But I didn't have the time to finish it the first time I saw it (I only got to the strip bar scene). Now comes the interesting thing: I had not actually finished the movie until just last night! But I still remember my first impressions when I saw it 3 years ago. The introductory scenes were so well filmed and put together that they stayed with me in my mind all this time. The movie celebrates what we all one way or another dreaded seeing come to pass: graduation and commencement. American Pie celebrates it with a humorous and raunchy romp through very similar characters. But it was Risky Business that this movie conjured images of as I watched.<br/><br/>Girl Next Door tells us the tale of Matthew Kidman: a young high school student in his senior year (Emile Hirsch) and his two best friends: the mischievous Eli (Chris Marquette), and Klitz (Paul Dano) the the geek with a heart...on. Matthew has received a letter of acceptance from Georgetown, and needs to solidify his chance of winning a speech contest for a scholarship. His school life is on edge, as he struggles to keep high marks and still be himself (and come up with a decent speech).<br/><br/>But he can't help but notice that the other kids (the populars/jocks) are always so...free. They skip class. They go places. They do what they want. But he simply dismisses it as ""because they don't care"".<br/><br/>The rest of the movie goes on the notion that what if morality isn't everything. What if fun meant more? This interesting concept is further pushed when a new neighbor moves in next to him. Danielle (Elisha ""god shes hot"" Cuthbert) is a typical girl next door...shinny and vibrant and smoking hot. She's a blond with a killer body. And she used to do porn! Matthew definitely falls for her at first sight, but has no clue about her past. But gradually this pair of opposites attract. You get the impression that Cuthbert's character seems relieved to find a good guy. And she begins to entertain this little infatuation of his (really funny ""dream"" sequences).<br/><br/>His life is turned upside down as she shows him how to live fun and free. In the meanwhile, his absence in class has been noticed by both his teachers and his friends. Matthew tries to Eli about this new neighbor of his, but he instead tries to turn it into another sex fantasy. Matthew truly believes in what he's experiencing with this girl. That is, until Eli uncovers the fact that she's done porn! In another effort to turn the whole thing into a fantasy, Eli tells Matthew to pursue her ""as if she's just a porn star"". Matthew has to decide if Danielle wants the good guy or the bad boy.<br/><br/>I leave it there as the movie is just much too awesome for to me spoil. For those who have seen it and have read my comment, you'll find it funny how I managed to go 3 years without ever getting past the strip bar scene.<br/><br/>An absolutely true and daring movie, with the best message to deliver to our young graduates: the juice was definitely worth the squeeze."

","The Girl Next Door, comes off as a little bit generic. For one, the story has pretty much been done before(i.e. Risky Business), Its the boy meet girl scenario which has been done a million times over from a million different angles and it its sprinkled a-plenty with tons of cheesy moments. But its the moments outside the cheesy ones that count in this film. The acting is excellent with some amazing characters making it the perfect combo in that category. The three main actors in the film,(Timothy Olyphant,Emile Hirsch,Elisha Cuthbert) are the some of the most engaging characters that I've seen in a comedy in awhile.

Of course there is the slight nudity, but then what R-rated comedy film doesn't have nudity? The script is very cleverly written, with smart jokes and lovable characters. You can feel just what the characters might feel, and really makes you think what you would do.

Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman a high school senior who's a brain and uptight never having any fun, until one day when he discovers his new next door neighbor(Elisha Cuthbert) who just happens to be hot so he tries to give her a try!

Well upon meeting and finding her name as Danielle they begin to talk, hang out and become friends, only Matthew soon discovers that Danielle is an ex porn star now his world and culture starts to spin out of control! True this film is your typical hormone driven sex flick with plenty of teen pranks, and many sexy scenes and quotes, yet the development of a loving and caring relationship forms between the two central characters. Many of the movies things are crazy but yet they help bring both Matthew and Danielle to love like the Las Vegas porn convention and the prom night sex education video! I must say the performance of Elisha Cuthbert is fabulous she's so cute and sexy and many scenes of her in this film were so hot! Especially the window and pool scenes, and the hotel clothing take off when she sported that sexy red bra and panties! Elisha really carried this film she's really a beautiful and sexy star.

In the Girl Next Door, every young male's dream comes true; an incredibly beautiful girl moves next door and you and her fall in love. Most young guys could connect and relate with Emile Hirch (Matthew Kidman). For me and other young guys I know, this would be a dream come true. It's a shame that love can't always be like this. Both Elisha Cuthbert (Danielle) and Emile Hirch (Matthew Kidman) do a great job portraying their characters. The characters are written very well. Every love scene is incredibly believable. Their acting ability adds to an already great movie. The director, Luke Greenfield, did a great job with The Girl Next Door. This movie shows that two people can fall in love even if one feels that the other is out of his or her league. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a great comedy or an exceedingly beautiful girl, being Elisha Cuthbert. A note for parents: I would not let anyone under 13 watch this movie.

","I saw this film quite recently, and though I'm a bit old for this type of stuff, I quite enjoyed it.

While Kelly is probably the most interesting character in the film, I don't think porn producers like him exist any longer. He was something of a crook and though I could be wrong, would have been more prevalent in the 70s and 80s when shooting/distributing x-rated film was prosecuted legally on a regular basis. Making what the public wants illegal often drives it underground, letting in criminal elements. He was an entertaining character though."

I was shocked though, because when i heard what it was about, i imagined being another stupid teen movie. I was wrong, it was a tale about romance but in the strangest events. <br/><br/>Emile Hirsh was fun to watch cause he was the troubled teen who was graduating his senior year. He wanted fun, this year he really wanted just to get out and play and skip classes. Yet the power getting in huge trouble held him back. His friends Eli and Clizts (SP) are funny, Eli an inspiring film director and Clizts is just a sad senior who needs reassuring and soon gets some. (if you know what i mean) <br/><br/>Elisha Cuthbert who is our lead actress who's taking care of her aunts house which of course is right next to Emile's home. He first encounters her when he peeks in on her when she was undressing. This seen made me fall on the floor and laugh until i had a straight jacket on in a soft room. She comes over making him believe she was going to tell. The father calls him down to the living room in a fashion like he was about to yell and scream making us believe she told them. <br/><br/>Turns out, she didn't and his mother says to take out Elisha and show her around town. Sweet revenge took right here. She was terrible to him here, i won't say right now, go see it yourself. <br/><br/>The movie plays out nicely until his friend Eli shows him Elisha in a porno he was watching. Poor Emile he was so disappointed at her. But then he totally acts like an ass and takes Elisha to a cheap hotel and pretends to do all this ridiculous stuff to give the hint that he wants sex. She totally knew what he was doing. She was just going along with it until he cracked. He did this all cause Eli told him to. Elisha was a former porno star, quiets, and soon Emile wants to you know what. <br/><br/>About this time, our villain, our asshole comes to picture. Kelly who his Elisha's old porn director, meets Matt and knows right away, he loves her. He plays with him until Matt gets a little to involved as soon as Elisha goes back to porno with Kelly. Kelly gets angry at Matt and soon threatens him to leave her alone. Many attempts on her, she comes back to him, revealing shes done...again. <br/><br/>Until Kelly come back as well, many funny and stupid things happen but it's wraps up at the end when Eli, Clizts, and Emile have porn stars as dates to the porn, you can pretty much guess what happens in the end. I love this movie and everything about it. Its a story about a boy who risks everything to prove to a girl she's worth more than she knows. It's great fun with with great acting and stupid jokes.

","As most reviewers explained, I knew what I was to come upon when I went to see this film. Since I was with my friends, whom were mostly guys, the major after-view conversation topic was Elisha Cuthbert's fine physical traits. This young lady is truly beautiful. But, one night, the cable-T.V. not bearing a great choice of feature films, I chose to watch this one, again, instead of terrible movies like The Matrix Revolutions or The Fast And The Furious.<br/><br/>Although this takes me unto a rather personal point of view, I viewed this re-run during a period of sore depression, and this movie undoubtedly cured it, at least for the night.<br/><br/>The story, which evolved into a simplistic script, not difficult to either dish out or dish in, gives the audience a great impression of deja-vu, although unlike most movies that are based on stories that bear this trait, this one contained a story that ""always seems to work"".<br/><br/>:::SPOILERS AHEAD:::<br/><br/>The story is, well, a story like others, but a simple one. This clean-cut teen whose scholarship life is based on work, finds his neighboring house being newly inhabited by a coming-out-of-nowhere angelic girl. A friendship builds on that. But false moves executed by the male protagonist chases off the girl, who happens to be a porn star. The fight to get her back begins. Now, of course, there is a main enemy here, whom is the girl's producer. The first battle is lost by our hero, but the next and last one, tied up with decent plot twists, is, on the other hand, won, and followed by what might be one of the most delightful and pain-relieving sexual scenes I have seen on film (adult films set aside).<br/><br/>Of course, the end, as most external reviewers like Rolling Stone Magazine have put it, is ""preposterously"" implausible. But, that being said, it really, in my point of view, relieves you of stress or pain, all in all becoming a visual aqua-seltzer. But the bad taste of the latter can be compared to the many shortcomings of the technical core of the picture.<br/><br/>Although many of the actors' flaws are unnoticed, well, we are not, as spectators, accompanied by Russell Crowe, Robert De Niro, or Jack Nicholson. But, what the heck? These young actors(the ones in pic) pretty much know there stuff, and are not totally incompetent, actually are far from it(except maybe for one of the principal male protagonist's friends, Eli).<br/><br/>So, this movie is not a compelling one, certainly not an ""oscar-buzz"", and not part of art- house cinema. It is simply a movie that, by its common story and script, may seem and is, only in more rated-R way, a been-seen pain-killer, depending on one's taste for story lines. Why don't I give it 5 or under? Well because I didn't really get bored, and because, although the laughs are scattered, they are present when they occur, and finally because the cinematography isn't amateurish or boring, it is actually quite surprising. Why didn't I give it over 6? Well, unless we are provocative, we all know why, don't we?"

The other characters are pretty good. the movie is well worth seeing and i would personally recommend it for the world to buy. in order to watch the film you need a fairly open mind. a lot of twists occur. the movie is more a drama film then any and it kept me on the edge of my seat from the very start. the movie is one that will make you laugh and also make you a bit sad with the occurrences that happen. you wont be disappointed when you buy this film. this film should be still at the top. to finish up this movie is one where you will not be disappointed. it is a crazy movie where at every corner their is a surprise.<br/><br/>Bye guys. everyone buy or at least see the film Bye by the way Elisha is HOT!!!!"

","Let me just start by saying before you read this that PRIOR to seeing this movie, I already believed Elisha Cuthbert to be the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen and that must be taken into account when reading this comment.<br/><br/>I had ZERO expectations when I put this movie on, heck, I even had my remote in hand ready to fast forward past all the parts of the movie that Elisha wasn't in, simply because she was all I was really there for. Now, that being said, I really enjoyed this movie. It was more heartfelt, charming, and witty then I EVER would have expected from what I had seen and heard about this film. It isn't gratuitous at all in nature, and the supporting cast is very strong. Actually a good basic love story that I would watch again. Now would I like it as much as I did if Elisha wasn't in it? No. I would have still enjoyed the movie, however. Elisha is SO very hot and maybe for that reason only you would disregard my statements and it may well be horrible because perhaps I am completed booty blinded. But I think you should give it a try, and you'll probably like it.<br/><br/>Line that defined the movie, ""What's the craziest thing you've done lately?""<br/><br/>My personal favorite, ""The juice is worth the squeeze."""

","An interesting movie I should say. It is a story about two teenagers who have different backgrounds, or I should say exactly the opposite. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch), a 18-years old nerd-achievement-oriented, started to step up to the whole new world when Danielle (Elisha Cuthberg) came as ""the girl next door"".<br/><br/>As a teenager movie, obviously, it contains most of the ""ingridients"" teenagers need. From the sweet romance date to the porn stars convention in Las Vegas, it has mixed pretty well as a teenager-comedy-romantic movie.<br/><br/>Play the role of Danielle, Elisha Cuthberg has become a big plus in judging this movie. I would say she looks fantastic although her role play does not need any spectacular acting skills to perform. Overall, she can bring you to the stage that you feel you would like her. Therefore, I give her credits for that.<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Girl Next Door worth to watch and one thing that stays in my mind after watching this movie is ""always know if the juice worth the squeeze""."

","For many of you with negative remarks to this film, i sense ignorance. As an independent film director such as myself, i have to compliment Luke Greenfield on his triumphant success on tackling such a difficult film. He uses symbols and cinematic ""acrobatics"" that portray the film in a fluid manner. Every shot and angle he uses, has meaning. The storyline is obviously unrealistic and far-fetched, however, the players do a fantastic job making it seem 'real'. Without a doubt, the players in this film are very talented, and i am sure they will find much success in their careers. Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are obviously extremely attractive people, and that is always a plus to any film. The movie was written like a text-book style film; (thematic usage and time frames are appropriate), which makes sense because Luke Greenfield is a young director. The cinematographer for this film was quite smart in the way he conservatively used close shots. I truly love the art design in the movie from simple set design to the outrageous color scheme. If some of you didn't notice, there are wonderful, vibrant colors used throughout the movie. Lastly, the only weakness in this film was the ending (from the prom scene on). For me, it felt rushed. The first half of the movie is slow paced and creates great conflict. The ending had too many spikes of conflict. In a film, there should only be ONE added conflict within the last 15 minutes of the movie. In this movie there were several conflicts, (fear of getting caught at the prom, problems with shooting the porn video, and of course the close call with almost getting in trouble with the parents and principal). The ending is summed up with a montage, which in my opinion is juvenile and a weak way to tie the movie up. Once again, this is because Luke Greenfield is a young director.<br/><br/>Thats how the cookie crumbles. Sorry to bore everyone, but i just needed to get that off my chest."

","a movie that doesn't suck. Emile Hirsh(The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys) and Elisha Cuthbert(24, Old School) make a cute couple in this sweet natured comedy. The problem is that the movie doesn't make the choice on what kind of a movie it wants to be, so it ebbs and flows within scenes between a sweet romance and a raunchy male fantasy. It could have been both, which would have been far more interesting. A good example is the scene where Eli(a lively Chris Marquette) shows Matt a video of Danielle. All we see are a bunch of unintelligible fleshy shapes. It would have made a bigger impact to see her get incredi-nasty to feel the horror that Matt feels. I assume that since the other two scenes where Elisha could have shown skin were skinless that she didn't want to do nudity. This is one of the cases where it hurts the film, although the scene in the motel is suitably jaw dropping. On the other hand, the stripper scene and Eli porn scenes deny the innocent tone of the film. Despite these discrepancies, the movie is still enjoyable. Timothy Olymphany(Go, Scream 2), James Remar(48 Hours), Paul Dano, and Timothy Botttoms(That's My Bush) add to the fun. Small appearances by Amanda Swinton(American Wedding) and Sung Hi Lee(Playboy Playmate) as porn stars get the blood boiling for the horny. The music is great(Hoochie Coochie Man, Lady Marmalade, and Teenage Wasteland). A fun little movie.<br/><br/>P.S. The juice squeezing line sucks a lot.<br/><br/>P.P.S.

","For those of you who saw ""Milk Money"" with Melanie Griffith, this movie runs along the same lines. Basically, you have a beautiful woman with a seedy background who falls in love with your average guy living in the burbs. ""The Girl Next Door"" takes things down to a teen level though when a former porn star moves in next door to a boy and steals his heart. Elisha Cuthbert (sure to be famous for her sizzling looks alone) plays the former porn star Danielle. Emile Hirsch plays head-over-heels Matthew Kidman. The film teeters a bit on how convincing it is, despite the unusual circumstances. It's interesting to note how Matthew treats Danielle like the sex toy he thinks she is when he discovers her past. I think this stigma or stereotype is probably true for most guys and how they think of porn stars, which makes a serious relationship all but impossible. What is unconvincing is how Danielle goes along with this. But perhaps she's just used to being treated this way even though she clearly wants a different future. I guess on a serious note and looking at the bigger picture, you could look at the whole film and wonder how realistically it portrays a porn star's life. Are there those that want to quit and just can't seem to get out of the industry, either because they are under duress or just don't have any skills...? And what about their boyfriends, husbands, etc.? Do they and should they accept their career choices or is there a better and more wholesome life out there they can help them achieve? I don't mean to sound too didactic, as ""The Girl Next Door"" is just a love story (obviously a bit complex though). Don't worry about the film being as serious as I am in its description. Plenty of laughs and nail-biting moments are had with a funny and surprising ending. 7/10"

","I just saw this movie and I have to say that it surprised the heck out of me!, in a good way though. I hadn't seen any trailers or posters for it and usually the liner notes on the cases, be it VHS or DVD is usually a load of Pooh, so all I knew was that it was a romantic teen comedy and it stars a beautiful Elisha Cuthbert and one of my favorite actors Timothy Olyphant. Now usually I'm not into romantic teen comedies but the fact that Timothy Oliphant was in it got me to rent it. And to my great surprise I thought it was quite funny, a little bit sweet and a little grim on occasions. Emile and Elisha really seem to have something going on there that isn't often seen between young actors in a movie such as this, they just click and it seems sincere most of the time. Elisha is well known for her acting in the hit show 24, but I had never heard about Emile Hirsch, I think he'll be big in Hollywood sooner or later, that kid is very good in the movie! OK there is some partial nudity and some strong language at times but all in all I think it's a very good movie!"

","The Girl Next Door arrived in Australia with little fanfare or advertising, largely due to its tepid response in the US. 'Girl' pitched in the trailer as a distant American Pie cousin meets Risky Business ('outrageous' incidents, nudity and 'hot chicks'), actually surpasses those film to deliver what has to be one of more entertaining 'teen' flicks of recent years. <br/><br/>This is not to say that this movie is a revelation in film making. The clichéd characters abound (uncool yet not gremlin-esquire lead, geeky friends, oblivious parents, the cool crowd) and the film follows a not entirely road to a happy ending, yet the journey is made satisfying by Emile Hirsch and Cuthbert's likable leads. Cuthbert in particular lends an interesting touch to her lead, she admirably conveys a young woman trapped between two worlds struggling to find her identity without being known as 'the chick from that porno'. Her early scenes with Hirsch set up a great coming of age storyline without resorting to some far fetched hi-jinx to impress. <br/><br/>During the middle third of this film (the introduction of Olyphant's porn producer character) the dynamic shifts from romantic comedy to comedy/drama, throwing you into some (albeit glossed over) realities of the porn industry. Hirsch becomes a more admirable lead during the later parts of the film as he comes to terms with his 'moral fiber'. <br/><br/>For a sex comedy closing in on two hours this film should drag in its last hurdles, and its 'climax' does feel to be pushing the boundaries of reality, but with competent leads and one of the best soundtrack's from a genre film of this type in years (Filter, David Gray, David Bowie, Echo & The Bunnymen) makes this Girl worth sticking around for."

","It's been interesting to see the reaction to this film. From what I can tell the two main criticisms are 1)that it rips off the teen-comedies of the 80s and 2) that it deals too lightly with porn-related issues. It's first important to note that films that simply rehash a tested formula can be accused of ""ripping off"" whereas a film which borrows elements but reworks them in a new and creative way, paying homage to their predecessors but taking the genre into new directions is certainly not ripping them off. It's wonderful to see high school life dealt with so intelligently while staying entertaining and fresh.<br/><br/>I watched this with my girl-friend who is very concerned with the whole porn industry and how the actresses are treated. But she couldn't see what was so offensive about the way they were portrayed in this film. The film isn't making a statement about the porn industry, it's talking about growing up. It's hyperbole, not hypocrisy. Strange how the gray-haired critics feel obliged to take offense.<br/><br/>3 out of 5 - Some strong elements"
"mcgill_j","7","0","0","3 January 2005"," An eccentric teen movie?
","I had read the similarities between this film and ""Risky Business"" which launched Tom Cruise into stardom. I hadn't really thought about it that much, even while watching the movie as much.. Even the next day now, I still really hadn't connected it as much until I read someone pointing out very very specific instances, and I do see them now more clearly.. But, Risky Business was a product of it's time.. Whereas this movie, it doesn't seem as much to be.. oddly. Starting with the rather eccentric soundtrack, in the opening scene? Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure"", this eclectic song choice fits the main character, quite well..<br/><br/>As do some of the other musical choices, while some are of the more obvious ""soundtrack selling"" titles they all seem to make sense taken in their proper context, while most of the soundtrack seems more a throwback to 70s and 80s.<br/><br/>The more risqué elements of ""Risky Business"" have been more or less jettisoned, although there is some topless nudity, (I refer to the UNRATED CUT on R1 DVD). Unexpectedly though, there's more of a relationship story in the film than I expected as well.<br/><br/>The one thing in Risky Business I never really considered, would these two people stay together? While they had a fiery sexual tension.. I didn't really see a ""relationship"".<br/><br/>Another similarity, in a nod to Risky Business is the bad guy.. who is actually given a bit more screen time. Joe Pantoliano only got to establish himself as the ""heavy"", also the friend characters (Curtis Armstrong, Bronson Pinchot) were never given much time to develop as characters in their own right.<br/><br/>Those are not missteps, but character development was not high on the list of that film's priorities. Aside from the main character of Joel, and his lady. Even then there seemed only more growth in Joel, which remains similar in this film with the male lead getting most of the development.<br/><br/>This film.. although a bit more ""silly"", although not going for the slapstick of American Pie, than the film I would consider its spiritual father figure.<br/><br/>Both characters share the same problem. They both have daydreams.. but,it's not the daydreams themselves.. but their inability, even as this one in its closing moments puts it dead out there if you hadn't been paying attention, to live for the moment and not see every bad thing that COULD happen.<br/><br/>This happens several times to Joel as he imagines scenarios, that go horribly awry.. this is acknowledged early on in this film in a scene where the main character is planning to ""ditch school"". How he sees how everything could develop, and where it could go bad. And in the end chickening out.. in the end, both characters learn to live in the moment and step up, so to speak.<br/><br/>As for the performances, I can actually only give good marks all around. From the leads, to the eccentric friends, and the two are they, aren't they bad guys.<br/><br/>What surprised me most was the work put into the ""bad guy"" character played by Timothy Olyphant who can be a nice and charming older brother one moment, and then a cold, calculating, and menacingly evil the next. But.. in the end, he's really not a clear bad guy.. sure he does bad things, as his interest in the film is the ""money"". He's a businessman pure and simple, and when his business is threatened, he isn't shy about letting people know.<br/><br/>Sadly the under used parents.. mostly Timothy Bottoms, who plays the father, who I last saw doing quite the image of our Commander and Chief George Bush. But, for what's there.. the characters, are much more explored and used well... the friends are definitely caricatures but they are funny and well used. Whereas in Risky Business the friends just, almost seem to vanish later in the film, whereas this one is much more using them throughout.<br/><br/>Even to the detriment of not showing ""The Girl"" of the title as much. The story becomes more and more about her, and trying to fix the problem he got himself into, much like in Risky Business, but gets rather.. I would say complicated, but that is the wrong word.<br/><br/>But her character seems to disappear in the background, and it becomes more of the leading man's character to try and save her from herself, and the world she's falling into. Although she isn't on screen, she's still very much a part of the story.<br/><br/>Special nods though to Cuthbert, Hirsch and Olyphant in their respective roles. Cutherbert who has such a sensual demeanor, while sometimes not even realizing it. Uses that to full effect, while also showing moments of vulnerability, and humor. Hirsh of course is the ""good looking"" geek guy.. Who goes from being scared to growing up by the end of the film. and learning what many of us do, sometimes you have to do the wrong thing to do the right one.<br/><br/>Olyphant though I single special praise though.. Because he goes from such a nice and almost charming older brother, to a menacingly and slimy character with such ease.. Your initial thought would be, what a slimeball, but he turns that perception quickly on it's ear.. but then, later in the film pulls the 180 being the bad guy you thought he was the whole time.. but even in the end, he does hold respect for the kid. I think it was really a tricky performance, to make someone you shouldn't like likable, then makes you hate him.. but in the end, you still get a smile in his very small ending moment.<br/><br/>In the end.. I liked that all of the more main characters got their moment. Their time to do something. Sometimes silly, sometimes sweet.. It definitely was not the average teen sex comedy farce I'd expected.."

","Although I'm definitely not a fan of teen movies or anything really pop-culture or mainstream (since the majority of music and movies in that category are crap) this one was definitely a cut above the rest. I picked it up at a movie rental going over to a friend's because I was bored and Elisha Cuthbert is super hot, but contrary to what I was expecting (something along the lines of Not Another Teen Movie) it turned out to have fairly good performances, some great one-liners, not a bad soundtrack, adequate directing and was overall very enjoyable. The majority of the cast have convincing performances, with Kelly being by far the funniest, most varied and most complex character, and they all seem very comfortable in their roles. The movie, as most do, has its share of sappy scenes (such as at the party when he starts kissing her; although sappy and unrealistic, this part is still a crucial part of the plot), but they are outweighed by the comedy (""I swear if you don't f*ck her I'll kill myself!"") and some of the dramatic scenes. The movie doesn't get boring or repetitive, has mostly uninspired but not bad cinematography, moves along at a good pace but isn't overly long or short, and has a somewhat different plot than the generic boy-meets-girl sh*t that's clogging Hollywood (although they did partly bring that plague onto themselves). Overall, this movie is worth seeing more than once, strikes a good balance between drama and comedy, is quite enjoyable, features mostly good performances and entertaining characters, and is worth buying. Definitely a cut above the rest, and is on my list of most enjoyable movies."

He falls and GETS the girl after the first 20 minutes of the movie... and THANK GOD for that. It tweaked my interests from the very start, because you see GETTING the girl isn't as easy as KEEPING her!! Notice at the end of the film, the way he ""accidentally"" introduces each of the characters to be who they really turn out to be (for HIM) in the end... i.e. Kelly as the Student Adviser.

","As a huge fan of all that is John Hughes, it was no surprise to discover certain homages paid to its teen movie predecessors. Even in the score of the film there was the underlying beat of that Risky Business mood music (or something closely resembling it) in key scenes with Emile. <br/><br/>In a film that could have easily turned to garbage with boobs and butts galore, the filmmakers never forgot that what we were dealing with here, is simply two kids trying to be comfortable in their own skin. They discover a balance in each other and fall head over heels. And why wouldn't they? I can't remember the last time in any recent release where two characters were able to communiccate so much through their facial expressions and eyes.<br/><br/>So what if the premise is far-fetched. We could all pick apart the logistics of such a scenario with its ridiculous improbabilities. However, the reason we all fork over our hard earned money at the box office or in rentals or in cable subscriptions is that we want to be entertained.

","Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a teen over-achiever from a well-to-do community, who falls for the super sexy girl watching the house next door (Elisha Cuthbert). As they get closer, he finds out that she is secretly a porn star, something that he must try to come to terms with as he suddenly finds himself wit a lot of new male friends.<br/><br/>The premise sounds pretty good and the film turned out to be pretty funny. The story isn't very original though. It's similar to Risky Business as every film critic has bothered to point out. That didn't bother me though since The Girl Next Door is still an entertaining comedy. Some of the jokes were kind of lame and the movie is a little forgettable. After about a week, only a few scenes really stuck with me. The movie remains consistently entertaining during the running time but it doesn't have a long lasting impression on the viewer nor does it have a good repeat value. It's just a harmless teen comedy and it should be approached as one.<br/><br/>The movie works pretty well because of its two appealing leads. Elisha Cuthbert is cool and confident as Danielle. She plays the character pretty well and she's also very pretty. Some people are complaining about Elisha playing the role of a porn star because she is not pretty enough. I strongly disagree, she looks stunning in the movie. Emile Hirsch also gives a good performance as Matthew. His character is likable and somewhat interesting. Tim Olyphant plays Kelly and he gives a pretty funny performance, kind of annoying though. Chris Marquette was just annoying as Eli. His character was supposed to be your stereotypical horny teenager but he just tried too hard to be funny.<br/><br/>Director Luke Greenfield is not that reliable as a director. He was behind that horrible movie called ""The Animal"" though he surprisingly does a decent job with this movie. He could have shortened the film a little though. 109 minutes was too long for this type of comedy and especially this story. They ran out of ideas and they seemed to be recycling the old ones. The ending was also kind of weak and not as funny as the beginning or middle. Despite this, I still don't understand why this movie bombed at the box office. It wasn't great but it was a fun way to spend two hours and it the movie does keep the audience entertained. In the end, this is one of 2004's best comedies and it's worth checking out. Rating 7/10"
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","0","13 November 2004"," Surprisingly mature teen movie
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>In the last ten years the teen, sex obsessed film, has been a favourite of film companies. With films like ""American Pie"" and ""Road Trip"", the genre developed well. Since the turn of the millennium however, this genre became almost a joke in itself. With people criticising the stories for being plain and an opportunity for topless women, this collection of teenage dream stories began to collapse. It was with a certain amount of worry that I watched ""The Girl Next Door"". The notion of a teenage comedy about pornography is basically going to be the ultimate teen flick with topless women constantly. Or so we would think, because whilst the plot is porn based, and there are a few scenes involving breasts, ""The Girl Next Door"" is in fact one of the more clever teen films to appear in the last few years.<br/><br/>Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is your typical high school nobody. With a planned future in politics, Matt remembers his school years as uneventful and unmemorable. This is until Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door however. Granting Matt a new view on life, Danielle accidentally exposes him to the porn industry after her former career is exposed.<br/><br/>The idea of a guy who falls for a former porn star is not a particularly appealing story. In fact, the entire notion is abysmal. As a consequence, ""The Girl Next Door"" should really be dumped on the ever growing pile of weak teen movies with no plot and excessive nudity. Ultimately though, the film tricks us all.<br/><br/>The beauty of ""The Girl Next Door"" is that it really is a well thought out movie. Limiting the nudity which you'd expect, the film focuses more on bringing Matt and Danielle together, whilst simultaneously bringing the young male out of his shell. Using the porn background as an escape route in fact, the story never exploits it's potential material and prefers to deal with it as something flawed and degrading. Seemingly condemning pornography as desperate tactics, the film focuses on the idea of the ""moral person"" rather than nudity.<br/><br/>With all teen films, there tends to be this one sidekick sort of character who always gives us the laughs. In ""The Girl Next Door"" we're given not just the nerd like Klitz (Paul Dano) but the superb porn obsessed Eli (Chris Marquette). With two quality sidekicks, Matt the hero is encouraged on his route and is actually shown to appreciate his friends. Perhaps in fact, this is the films greatest message. For all the potential nudity in a film about the porn industry, the story always concentrates it's messages in the direction of self advancement and the idea of friendship. We're never meant to believe that sex is this wonderful thing we're meant to do. In fact, often the film presents the opposite view. What the story tells us is that irrelevant of what happens in our lives, our friends will be there for us.<br/><br/>""The Girl Next Door"" could quite easily have fallen into that category of being another teen, nudity filled movie. With a bit of intelligence however, the story stands out above others as an almost moral barrier. The film shows us that whilst sex and pornography are rampant in the modern world (one middle aged friend of our hero appearing in a strip club), the most important part of life is simply having people around who understand and appreciate you. For another addition to your teen genre, ""The Girl Next Door"" is a surprisingly impressive film."

","Live<br/><br/>Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) had lived his life by the book. He only did what he thought was the right thing to do. He never actually had fun, or did anything exciting. One day he realizes a beautiful woman, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), is living next door. Matt and Danielle meet after she catches him watching her undress, and they later awkwardly form a relationship. Matthew ends up falling in love with The Girl Next Door. Matt's friend, Eli (Chris Marquette), is in disbelief when he finds out that Danielle is a pornstar. He shows Matt a clip of film from one of her movies. Matt is devastated because he was head over heels for this girl, and finds out she has a dirty secret she was hiding. Eli convinces Matt to stay with Danielle, and on one morning Matt runs into Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), Danielle's manager. Kelly takes Danielle to the pornography film convention to promote her film that Kelly intends for Danielle to be in. Matt goes to the convention to remind Danielle of who she really is and tells her: 'This isn't you.'<br/><br/>This film tries to show people what life is all about. It promotes optimism in a way that we don't have to do something that we don't want to. Never forget who we are. On the other hand, it also shows that life is about finding love. Danielle, a pornstar, falls in love with Matt, a boring geek, and shows him how to have fun in life. In an awkward way, this film does get these two primary messages across well. This movie shows that real love is about personality and caring, rather than good looks and money.<br/><br/>This movie is most appealing because it is downright hilarious. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The plot is very awkward, but original. At certain times in this film, I thought that I had it figured out, but there are so many scenes that changed the plot greatly. The ending surprised me. I highly doubt that anyone could not like this movie because it is that funny."

The two most important things that came to me were the way Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert looked at each other through out the whole movie and the music.

"kolyanbogie","Null","0","0","13 October 2004"," Suspend disbelief for a fun movie
","One of my pet peeves about movies and TV shows about teenagers or high school is the tendency to use actors several years older than the characters. Henry Winkler was in his late twenties-early thirties when he played ""The Fonz"" on Happy Days. He was obviously too old to be in high school, as was Ron Howard. James Dean was in his early twenties when he played a teenager in Rebel Without a Cause - and looked it. Elisha Cuthbert was 20 when she played Danielle in The Girl Next Door - and looks it. At least Emile Hirsch was 17 when he played his character. Then there is the problem of believability: would a young porn star who has been around the block fall for a green, straight-arrow kid, and would he jeopardize his future for her? Probably not, but if you can suspend disbelief, this movie is worthwhile. For me it was worthwhile just to look at Elisha Cuthbert (a very unsexy name for a very sexy woman) and the way she looks at Hirsch. Anyone expecting a lot of nudity in the ""unrated version"" will be disappointed - contrary to what one might expect in an unrated version. There's a scene in a strip club featuring topless women with storebought boobs, and we never do see Cuthbert nude. An ""R"" rating would easily apply. The director's commentary is useful and interesting if you want insight into the mindset of the Hirsch character and the idea of high school as a grind where many students like they're missing something."

","Is it me, or did the lead actor jump out of a Leonardo DiCaprio machine? And did the girl next door almost get copied perfectly to be Cameron Diaz? The plot and storyline was interesting, and the way the vocabulary was used sung true to the idea that sex education is outdated in America. This may not be about sex, but more about just being yourself, and if you like that idea, you need to watch this movie, just so you can have a good time feeling inside what others wish they could outside, unique and strong, bold.<br/><br/>The lead character is something to be remembered as a hero of innocence, and the girl next door is trying to gain that back by leading him into hell, at least a suburban hell. While this is a film that marks a bit above B movie level, it certainly hangs well with its choice of soundtrack items. I can't remember a movie tha tmade me stay up till 7am thinking about it, and this does it. Whatever does it for you, this does it for me. It's a boy's tale of being a hero in the last few years we still can be heroic and it seems like it matters. The years of innocence and coming of age bring forward an experience here that makes you wonder if anything corporate America has to offer can match up with The Girl Next Door."

Everyone else is pretty much unknown in the UK. I bought in a buy one get one free deal with Starsky & Hutch. This was by far the better of the two. The actors all pull off great performances. The teenage boys are much more real then in Movies of a similar genre. The comedy is slightly more subtle then the likes of American Pie and Road Trip and are no were near as obvious. The plot is moved along by the comedy. The two stars Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch are convincing. But Chris Marquette, Paul Dano and Timothy Olyphant steal every scene they appear in.

It could've become a very romantic, inspiring movie, but the director apparently decided to emphasize the comic aspect of the picture, thus sacrificing character development & general credibility. The jokes, to tell the truth, are not hilarious either. They are likely to bring a smile up on your face & keep it throughout the movie, but you ain't gonna be laughing your head off.<br/><br/>What saves this movie is outstanding acting! Such a wonderful performance by the cast alone makes The Girl Next Door worth watching. The on-screen chemistry between Emile Hirsch & Elisha Cuthbert is undoubtful. James Remar is charismatic as usual & Timothy Olyphant is almost perfect. The funniest role is played incredibly successfully by Chris Marquette, who at times steals the show completely.<br/><br/>I'd like also to mention the great soundtrack, which totally suites the movie & is I think worth purchasing.<br/><br/>In the end, this sappy comedy is likely to improve your mood & you'll probably enjoy great acting.

","For those who enjoyed John Hughes teenage angst movies such as the Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles and the raunchy trilogy of American Pie, this will be right down your alley. The leads Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Chris Marquette and Paul Dano carry themselves very strongly, almost to the disadvantage of the rest of the cast who become vital structurally, but otherwise completely unnoticeable. There is an occasional violent tone to this movie that clashes bizarrely with its otherwise comedic nature and the scenes are very disturbing. Additionally dream sequences are blended with real-time sequences, for occasionally comedic, sometimes freakish effect. Timothy Olyphant almost steals the show as a sociopathic porn producer who you never quite know if you want to cheer on or wish he were dead.<br/><br/>Hirsh and Cuthbert mix quite well, blending the finding and losing of innocence with a pleasant sincerity. Chris Marquette comes across as a young John Laroquette type character from ""Night Court"", and is entertaining. Borderline on visibility, but filling in when he does, is Paul Dano. Visually and scriptwise the movie is a lot of fun throughout, and tries to avoid wading in its own sincerity too much. The 'unrated' version hardly seems to need to be unrated, and I'm not precisely sure what separates this movie from a modest R rating.

Even the sexual references and nudity seemed more mature, more justifiable than one would normally expect. It's also a very funny movie, and in a surprisingly intelligent way. The best thing about it though, is the fact that the plot is not excruciatingly predictable. In fact I found it rather surprising.<br/><br/>I can see why some people are put off by the middle section of the film, or by some of the plot twists.

","Let's get something clear first  I hate teenage comedies. Why? Because they're stupid, seriously NOT funny (at all I may add) and copycatted. Basic plot for a teen comedy goes something like this ('I've got the power'): A Guy who is usually a schmock, who nobody likes and bigger boys like to play pranks with him, falls in love with A Girl of some high status or whatever. He has A Buddy (or more) who is funny but ugly as hell, whit whom The Guy advises with. Now after a few minutes of boiling, add sex, nudity, foul language, a streak of homosexual references. Let it cook for about five minutes. If that's not enough, add more sex and nudity. After that add The Idiot (who will make The Guy regret he was born) and The Man (most good-lookin' guy in school). If THAT ain't enough add more nudity. This is a recipe for a BAD teen comedy<br/><br/>Unfortunately in the last 20 years there hasn't been a sincere teen comedy. The last good one I saw was 'The Breakfast Club' and that's well I'll be damned 20 years ago! After a series of teen comedies for retarded somebody has remembered how things used to be done in the old days and made The Girl Next Door. It doesn't have anything new to say about love or romance but it has a soul and 'a most appealing crew I saw in years' as one of my fellow IMDb colleague 'critics' wrote.<br/><br/>Movie follows the basic teen plot: guy meets a girl, falls in love, loses the girl and spends the rest of the movie trying to win her back The point is I never saw sidekicks so live, situations more-or-less real and confusion and fantasies presented with such reality. Script is excellent and jokes (told so many times now) are somehow revived and renewed so they look fresh and inspiring. The usual teen comic relief character (AKA The Idiot) is given a 'Max Payne' personality (see the movie, you'll get it). The sidekicks are excellently written and acted, and somehow reminded me of Bill & Ted. Surprisingly there are no 'bad guys' around, no slutty sex-crave college girls.<br/><br/>Now as you can see, I really, really, really liked this movie. Please see it, you might like it too. 9/10"

Purity, abstinence from sexual behaviorisms. I'm not talking' God, I'm an Atheist, but this is my opinion, this is what Hollywood has become, what the whole of America is becoming, and it's disgusting.<br/><br/>This movie, and American Pie, are the prime examples of what I would use to describe what, and at the same time, WHY, teenage America has become a snake pit of sexual mannerisms and disgusting movies. <br/><br/>Not only disgusting in sexuality, but my gosh look at what they did to Resident Evil, it went from a realistic horror video game, to a fake action movie where of course they're gonna do back-flips and cartwheels while attacking zombies, instead of the video game's ""hopeless"" feel, that actually MADE IT a HORROR game.<br/><br/>I could play the 2nd Resident Evil, record it, and it would be 10x more realistic than the D-movies that are being released, that have bad acting and people who are OBVIOUSLY not scared, intimidated, or at all worried about the ""horror"")<br/><br/>When I first saw the TV Promo for The Girl Next Door, it was all I could do not to throw the ashtray at the TV. She's changed, people unfortunately do change, they follow the sexual mainstream and turn slutty. Keep your girlfriends in lock, young men, for the only reason ""Cheaters"" only features cheating men, is because they haven't enough film to capture all of the cheating women on tape.<br/><br/>Don't ""Blame Canada"" for this one, folks, because Elisha wasn't like this until she crossed over our border, was she?"

","This movie could have been so much more than it turned out to be. It had a great premise, great young actors with a lot of chemistry, but unfortunately it took a bad turn 30 minutes or so into the movie. Up till that point it was going great, focusing strongly on the personalities and vulnerabilities of the characters and the love story between them, which is what I think makes a movie good. It then, for no apparent reason, took a left turn onto the road of zany hijinks. So much of the camera time was devoted to the male characters running around getting into wacky situations that the love story was simply squeezed out of existence. I'm sure making movies is tough, but there's a simple rule every filmmaker should know--anticipation is everything, and this movie lost that in the first 30 minutes."

","I remember when I watched ""Pretty Woman"" for the first time. I was appalled at how everyone loved Richard Gere and how it was touted as the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I seemed to be the only person who was creeped out by the fact that Gere was only into Julia's character for the sex! He was paying her for sex and dressing her up to make her presentable! At the end, I half expected him to say, ""sorry, I have to go home to my wife in New York now."" THAT would have been an interesting story.<br/><br/>Enter ""The Girl Next Door."" Very similar storyline except our hero, Matt, is blissfully unaware of Danielle's past. He falls for her because of who she is. It's when he finds out she's a porn star that things start to crumble. Then she goes back to it, but Matt chases after and tells her ""you're better than this.""<br/><br/>This story of love, grace, jealousy and forgiveness reminds me a lot of the story of Gomer from the Bible (in the book of Hosea, for those interested -- tiny little book at back of the Old Testament).

","The Girl Next Door is more than what it had been advertised. Fox chose to market it as a sex comedy, but indeed this film is way more than that. It follows in the footsteps of Risky Business and American Pie and does something that few sex comedies do anymore; give depth to the story. But that doesn't mean that the story is any good. In fact, it is so unrealistic and so overwritten that the film itself starts to get boring. The first half-hour is the most interesting because you care about the characters. However, when they drag in scenes like the one in Las Vegas or the robbery scene, then the story just dwindles so far down into a bottomless pit of nothingness. The screenplay does have some clever nuances like the creation of a new and totally original sex-ed video which would send shockwaves around the country if such a tape were ever released. But at the heart of the story is the relationship between Matthew and Danielle (played well by Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert) which is the most thoughtful thing about this film. But the story drags away from that and slips away from being more decent than it could have been. However, the film is better already in the fact that it is not just a flat sex comedy because then the film would not have any depth whatsoever. So I give credit to the writer and the director for making that happen. However, I guess I have to say that such depth is not enough to make this film good. <br/><br/>Lenny's Grade: C+"

","I was so annoyed that I was unable to see it at the cinema as it I really wanted to, so I have just purchased it on DVD and am glad I did.<br/><br/>Very rarely do I watch a movie and want to be a part of it. However, with the Girl Next Door that's what I immediately thought while watching and after the movie had finished. For me this movie can relate to all guys out there. Matt Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a normal guy, not doing anything special and just trying to make his way through life. This completely changes when he sees the beauty that is Elisha Cuthbert. Immediately you can see the chemistry is there between them and no matter what happens they are destined to be together. Every guy in the world dreams of their perfect girl next door and for me Elisha resembles it to perfection. In most teen movies the girl is bad to start off with and has a tough-guy boyfriend. This the complete opposite with Elisha. She is sweet, caring and sexy and falls for Emile from the very beginning. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters are great as well. Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), Klitz (Paul Dano) and Eli (Chris Marquette) play great supporting roles. The movie provides the correct mix of characters and story lines and ties up brilliantly at the end. <br/><br/>Before seeing this movie most guys would only think about normal teen comedies and think - Elisha Cuthbert and nudity. The fact she doesn't go nude brings he a tremendous amount of respect both as a character and as an actress. As she said on the DVD "" I wasn't going to do full-frontal nudity but was willing to go further than i had before"".<br/><br/>Overall I say 10/10. During this movie I fell in love with the girl next door so if Mr. Luke Greenfield ever reads this and is considering a sequel - give me a call."

","The recent glut of 90's gross out teen movies has just received another member into its fold. However, while the likes of Road Trip and American Pie may be welcomed with open arms and encouraging pats on the back, The Girl Next Door is more likely to be greeted with a non committal handshake and a couple of suspicious sideways glances. You see, this movie, despite its flaws (and there are plenty) manages to possess something that so many similar films lack. Namely? A heart.<br/><br/>I will admit to not being averse to a bit of gross out humour. While such gags as those in the American Pie movies are hardly high art, they at least draw a belly laugh from the audience now and then. I went in to The Girl Next Door with the opinion that this was going to be another attempt by Hollywood to follow the now successful American Pie recipe. Throw a bunch of attractive twenty something's into a film to play characters up to ten years their juniors, add a couple of party scenes, a vaguely pop/rock soundtrack and plenty of bodily fluids. Leave to bake until a nice golden brown before serving to the viewing public. <br/><br/>Imagine my surprise then, when I found The Girl Next Door to be more akin to some of the classic teen movies of the 1980's, in particular the early Tom Cruise vehicle Risky Business. While it never quite reaches the balance or sharpness of some of those films, it nevertheless manages to stand aloof from its more modern brethren, and dare I say it, perhaps a touch higher as well.<br/><br/>Young Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is coming to the end of his High School life. He's a straight A student who aims to succeed in everything he does. Needless to say, he has also kept to the straight and narrow, and now that his High School days are coming to a close he's beginning to feel that he may have missed out on the wilder side of his youth. All this will change however when the gorgeous Danielle begins house sitting next door (24's Elisha Cuthbert). The pair spark up a relationship as the more confident and free spirited Danielle tries to help Matthew discover what he's been missing out on all these years.<br/><br/>It is in this early portion of the film that The Girl Next Door most resembles some of its classic predecessors. The cast mesh exceedingly well together, Hirsch and Cuthbert providing stand out performances that really elevate the movie beyond its somewhat mundane early premise. Hirsch's Matthew is a wonderfully balanced character who is both intelligent, and yet occasionally astonishingly naïve. It also makes a nice change that despite his relatively buttoned down lifestyle, Matthew can hardly be described as a geek. Cuthbert puts in a wonderful turn as Danielle providing the character with a more down to earth feel than many of the similar characters in other movies, and succeeds in making the audience understand why Matthew falls for her the way he does. Also of note is Chris Marquette as Matthew's terminally horny and pornography obsessed friend Eli. <br/><br/>It's hardly hiding any major plot twist to say that Danielle is somewhat more than she first appears. Eli's viewing habits quickly uncover the fact that she is a porn star and it's with this revelation that the movie loses its way somewhat. The plot line becomes increasingly dense and convoluted as it tries to tie together numerous plot strands and only half succeeding. The introduction of Timothy Olyphant (best known as the drug dealer Tod from Go) as Danielle's producer and ex boyfriend Kelly also proves to be both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because Olyphant was born to play these kind of laid back, cool yet sleazy types, and effortlessly manages to steal every scene he's in, a curse for almost exactly the same reason. Kelly quickly becomes one of the movie's major driving forces and his efforts to keep the two apart practically supplant the increasingly awkward romance of Danielle and Matthew. The dramatic decrease in Cuthbert's actual screen time in the movies second act only serves to hammer this fact home. At roughly an hour and forty minutes, the film is also a little long. Comedies should never really run above an hour and a half, and this one could easily have been condensed if some of the extraneous plot elements had been dropped.<br/><br/>However, despite struggling under its own weight in the second act, director Luke Greenfield manages to pull everything together for what is ultimately a fun and satisfying conclusion. The final twist to the story is wonderful and the last scenes manage to tread that oh so fine line between cool touching sentiment and cloying mushiness.<br/><br/>The Girl Next door is ultimately a film that aspires to loftier goals than so many of its contemporaries. It strives to tug at your heart and truly make you feel for the characters involved. That it by and large succeeds in that goal is a testament to the movie. However the fact that it loses its bottle halfway through and throws in a series of unnecessary and often distracting plot lines to try and compensate for a deficiency that quite frankly didn't exist in the first place is all the more saddening. Those waiting for a classic modern teen movie to rank up there with films like Say Anything and The Breakfast Club will unfortunately have to wait just that little bit longer."

However, after a good half an hour of watching this movie a began to see that a little more time had been taken to make this movie stand out from others, this was down to several factors; 1) the film stars no real ""A-List celebrities"", not only giving new actors a chance to show how good they really are, but giving you a clean view of the role they had undertaken for this movie, in transition to other actors, i.e Sean William Scott, spending the entirety of any post-American Pie movie he's starred in, NOT to be like Stifler. 2) the story. It's well written, with subtle plot twists, allowing for you to sometimes spot whats about to happen before it does, and though some people would say thats a negative, though it leaves me feeling quite pleased with myself. 3) talented, young actors. The supporting acting done by Matthew Kidman's (Emile Hirsche) two best friends, managing to play nervous, uncomfortable, and studd.

","First of all, I loved this movie. It really irritates me how it was set up by the PR people to be another American Pie or Van Wilder or something of the sort. Those movies are just gross out teen comedies. This movie actually had HEART. The problem is, a movie like this misses 90% of its audience because 80% of the audience is guys (aged 13-75) hoping to see Elisha Cuthbert naked, while the other 10% already writes it off as another teen comedy and doesn't give it a chance. What is the deal?!? If you watched this movie once, watch it again and pay attention to the message and the character development.

","Elisha Cuthbert. What more can I say? This cute little sex-kitten is the best thing to come out of Canada since Brian Adams. As for this film? It was good enough for me to take the time to comment on, so that is certainly saying something.<br/><br/>The Girl Next Door goes against a couple of long standing norms in that it is: A)	A creative, engaging coming-of-age flick B)	A classy film about porn<br/><br/>Granted, Elisha Cuthbert could stand in front of a camera making pouty lip-faces and giggle that cute little laugh of hers for 75 minutes and the film could gross 75 million, but this movie just inexplicably `did it' for me, no pun intended...the plot was able to stand on its own.<br/><br/>The imagination that this film inspires: the notion that a moment of serendipity can await an unsuspecting, worthy person is what really inspired me. This movie also managed to avoid the majority of the teen romance clichés, which is certainly a good thing. I gave this one an unequivocal 10 rating: Not only did Elisha Cuthbert make this film great, but the plot was quite impressive too, as I certainly wasn't expecting much. <br/><br/>

I really thought I would enjoy this film, and even thou I like Cuthbert a lot, I don't think she's worth it, this film doesn't give any positive emotions, it's pretty mediocre and leaves no feeling, nothing at all, except of course a feeling that one has badly invested his time.<br/><br/>Next to this film, American Pies and other teen movies look fairly good.<br/><br/>My advise is to watch this film only if you are bored to death, or if you really like Elisha Cuthbert."

","The Girl Next Door. I'll state the reason that I watched the movie in the first place in two words  Elisha Cuthbert. Actually that would be reason enough to sit through ANY movie. But to tell the truth I really liked the movie. There is something about the movie. The movie made me laugh and yet have a stupid grin plastered on my face all throughout, cause I know what its like to be a love-sick idiot. I'm one of those melodramatic fools It's a simple tale all throughout the movie but told like a charm. But like most teen movies it tends to be a different wrapping for the same teen movie stuff. What is it with the teen movies? The general rule is that everything happens at the high school. Think of all the movies and TV series and tell me what DOESN'T happen in the high school. And what's with the prom? I'm kinda tired of all teen movies having a climax set at the senior prom. How come the dork ALWAYS gets the hottest girl? Come on, this is giving insecurity complex to the actual good looking blokes!! The Girl Next Door. Its sweet, its nice. Its great to sit through. I'd say the movie's strength lies in its characters. Not the predictable high school dorks but the actual girl next door  a porn star, and other bits and pieces of the porn industry. My favorite is Danielle's producer Kelly. This guy is one in a million. Rough and tough he can work his way into anyone's books. Danielle's porn mates, April and Ferrari, are a great laugh too. The movie had me laughing with all its twists (and turns) in the tale.<br/><br/>In the end everyone will go home, but I don't think many would feel as if they have lost the moments from life all the time that they spend watching this movie. But I'm still wondering the next time I go to see the movie (cause sure as Hell I'm going again) if I should take my GF with me. Me gawking at naked chicks is not what she particularly likes!!"

","*Throws my arms up* I don't really know what to say. I know that will shock a lot of people, especially anyone that knows me, but it's true. Well, I do know a few things to say, so I'll give it a shot. This had the potential to be a good movie, but the subject matter is just too uncomfortable for me. The movie has its funny moments, and the actors mostly do a credible job, but I can't throw my support behind a movie that chooses to turn the porn industry into a great, big, huggable teddy bear.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch (""The Emperor's Club"") does a good job, but man, he's totally channeling Kevin Arnold! WHERE'S PAUL PFEIFFER WHEN YOU NEED HIM???? And Elisha Cuthbert looks mighty fine, but I don't know if I completely bought into their relationship. I was surprised when I found out they were supposed to be the same age in the movie. In real life she's three years older than he is, and she looks even older than that in the movie. But the scene-stealer in this movie is Timothy Olyphant. At times he seems like a good guy with a good heart, and then he turns around and makes you think, ""Whoa, what a psycho."" Granted, I'm sure many people have felt the same way about their relatives, but this guy is an extreme case.<br/><br/>My main problem is ""The Girl Next Door"" is clearly marketing itself as a teen movie (just watch any of the recent commercials), yet it seems to send a message that hey, a little pornography might just be a worthy after-high-school business plan! ""You're a straight-A student, but you don't have the money to go to Georgetown? Noooooo problem, hook up with a porn star, film a porn flick in your school library, and make tons of money!"" Am I the only one who finds that to be an inappropriate message? I hope not. I sure know Jack Arnold wouldn't have stood for this! <br/><br/>THE GIST  <br/><br/>Why use your intelligence or hard work to solve a problem when you can fall back on the old ""sex sells"" adage, ""The Girl Next Door"" asks. Well, why spend your hard-earned money on this movie and prove them right, is what I ask. And don't call me a prude. We're talking about a movie that wants its intended teen audience to think that the porn industry offers some viable after-school career options. It doesn't take a preacher or an episode of ""7th Heaven"" to realize that message is a bit problematic."

","Lets face it, teen movies aren't exactly rocket science. You have your basic formula of boy meets girl, boy makes a mistake causing girl to leave, boy comes to terms with himself and makes a meaningful speech to win girl back. Insert the occasional fart joke and the cocktail is complete.<br/><br/>The Girl Next Door has all this, but it has a little more as well. It begins in typical fashion but its not long before its playing with the usual teen movie conventions a bit. There are three main facets to the film with it being split up quite obviously, with little running commentary between, but this is what makes this film a bit different and interesting. It wants to be something a little more unusual and in the end it succeeds.<br/><br/>I think overall most of the actors in the film did a fine job although for me Olyphant stole the show as Kelly, even though it seems the writers weren't sure whether we were supposed to like him or not. There are a few nice plot twists here and there which mix it up a bit and Elisha Cuthbert is undeniably cute throughout. It is a little surprising that her part is played down two thirds of the way through the movie though, since it is supposedly about her.<br/><br/>Worth watching if you're bored like I was. Expect the usual teen comedy formula, but at the same time be prepared for something a little different and you should find this an enjoyable 2 hours."
"vertigo_14","Null","0","0","22 May 2004"," Bland ""Risky Business"" Rip-off. (SPOILERS)
","The a variation on other popular 80s teen films, The Girl Next Door is 2004's answer to Risky Business (not only does the story model it, but there are many subtle references to it), only the latter proved to be a much better movie.<br/><br/>Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is much like Joel Goodsen. He's a smart kid who follows the rules, but once he's willing to test his limits, he shares in many crazy adventures. Like Joel, these adventures get him into a world of trouble. <br/><br/>However, unlike Joel, Matthew is more of a ""geek"" by today's standards. He's student council president (although I thought that was an honor awarded through a popularity contest), slated for a future at an Ivy League School, and has two equally unadventurous friends. He thinks his adventures will come from hanging out with the popular kids, but instead, it comes from a chance meeting with The Girl Next Door. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Joel was never really an unpopular kid, and didn't aspire to be on of the in-group, either. He was just one guy who had to test the rules and be willing to take chances to have some fun.<br/><br/>Although it is a variation on 'Risky Business,' The Girl Next Door is catering to modern standards of parental safety. Even though it earned an 'R' rating in the U.S., there are is no real nudity, and surprisingly, no references to drug use. But more importantly, The Girl Next Door is not a prostitute, instead catering to the hormonal raging teen audiences (especially male audience) with a safer version of the promiscuous girl. Whereas the girl in Risky Business was a prostitute, here, she is merely a porn star.<br/><br/>So, when Matthew meets Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), his new next door neighbor for the time being, she shows him some good times, trying to get him to toss out his inhibitions. They have good times together. But about the point that Matthew's friend (this film's equivalent to Miles), Eli, tells him that the pretty girl next door is actually an adult film star, the movie becomes far too ludicrous and starts to fall apart.<br/><br/>First is the tired fantasy of young men in today's films that they will suddenly meet a girl of a promiscuous profession, the same aspirations of Kenny Fisher in Can't Hardly Wait, of the entire gang in American Pie, and so forth. It is really a boring story line that today's films can't seem to do much with, let alone leave it out of the movie altogether. Here, it becomes even more ridiculous. <br/><br/>For Matthew, it leads to a confrontation between Matthew and Danielle's former producer (Timothy Olyphant) who has big investments riding on Danielle's performances. But, these hefty investments fall through when Danielle decides to give up the trade on Matthew's urging that she's better than that, Kelly (the producer) comes looking for Matthew. He steals the money Matthew has invested for a Cambodian exchange student and meddles in an important speech he must give for a Georgetown Scholarship. Actually, we can once again see the safety of this movie, since Guido ""The Killer Pimp"" was a much more dangerous adversary in 'Risky Business' (even going so far as to shoot at Joel as he is driving away from the restaurant in the chase scene). <br/><br/>The movie wavers between the boring and ludicrous as Matt starts to get into more trouble than he can bare, needing a plan to make fast cash. So, fulfilling the male teen fantasy is all this movie hopes to do (playing out more like a wet dream than a movie...notice the fascination with proving male worthy by size of penis in the finale when Klitz's friends are watching his part in the movie they make) when Matt and his friends use some of Danielle's connections to create a porno film on the night of their prom. This is about the point when you can just throw you hands up and forget about expecting anything good to come out of this cop out ending. Blah...blah...blah, Kelly tries to put a stop to it (how he knew about the movie or got his hands on the tape is something the writer's never bother to clue us in on) and threatens to show it to Matthews parents who are happy with it (you'll see why), everyone is happy in the end, and it works out better than expected. <br/><br/>In Risky Business, on the other hand, nothing was ever as so much in-your-face as it is here. Here, the movie is riddled with stereotypes and conventional teen movie elements: the popular crowd of horny guys and easy girls; the exceptionally horny and stupid friend (Eli); and the wholly stupid situation that will help them solve all of their woes (the sex movie). <br/><br/>With Risky Business, Joel and his friends weren't horny morons that craved to be part of the in-crowd. Joel just wanted to be with a beautiful girl, and he got what he asked for. Except in dealing with a prostitute, you had more reason to believe that Joel's adversary would be a violent one (as compared to say, Kelly, the porno producer who likely has ample opportunity to make other money, but wastes all his time on a high school kid). The problems that Joel confronts are more suspenseful (getting suspended from school, getting kicked off a student project, having his dad's car fall in a lake, getting robbed, and blowing his college admissions interview).<br/><br/>Here, Matthew screws up his speech for Georgetown and is robbed of 25 grand in an impossible situation (you need two signatures and proof of identification to clear out an account that big...i doubt even a charmed teller would let that slide if she was so worried about her job afterwards). The whole movie just becomes so utterly stupid. Best you save your time for ""Risky Business."""

","Imagine the following scene, if you will.<br/><br/>It's the early eighties and Paul Brickman drops his file. It's a windy day in Hollywood and out of his file spills out his latest script and because of the inclement weather, many of the pages blow away, never to be seen again, at least by him.<br/><br/>Come forward twenty years or so...<br/><br/>Wagner & Goldberg find the lost pieces of Brickman's script and decide to write a movie of their own, using the script they found as the plot. Obviously, they are missing bits, so they fill in said missing bits themselves. ...and this movie is what we're presented with as original.<br/><br/>The above scenario is so plausible because 'The Girl Next Door' borrows many ideas from Brickman's script for 'Risky Business'. Take the high achieving student with the head for business. Take the ne'er-do-well Rebecca De Mornay and transform her into Elisha Cuthbert, from high class hooker to teenage pornstar.<br/><br/>Take the cliched happenstance of risking everything for a recently learned philosophy and the love of a dangerous but good-hearted and misunderstood woman. Our lead in each case goes through a gamut of emotions from initial fear to cool bravado. They both get the girl and the prize by the end, though which one is more important is made abundantly clear to us, as if teaching us the same lesson, as if we needed it repeating.<br/><br/>I see this in a very different light, viewing it now at thirty -five, than when I first saw Risky Business at fourteen. The film is no less for my slightly altered perspective and I'm sure those people viewing it now in their teenage years will call this 'inspired' rather than 'reproduction'.<br/><br/>The lessons are the same, though the approach is slightly different. While Risky Business was a classic of the genre, I assume that when I'm fifty-five, people the age I am now will view this in the same light.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film and laughed out loud on a couple of occasions. I think this will do more for Cuthbert than any of the main protagonists, more than RB did for De Mornay, certainly. Whether that is deserved or not appears to be unimportant. <br/><br/>Where De Mornay smouldered, but lacked in audience participation, as far as her characters' feelings were concerned, Cuthbert's own character demands more attention, although her ability to exude sexuality is surpassed by De Mornay's x-rated business acumen.<br/><br/>A very good teenage movie. I hate to categorise it as that, but it is difficult to call it anything else. Much better than I was expecting."

","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>What is Matthew (Emile Hirsch) supposed to do when, despite his academic achievements in high school, he hasn't got any special memories to write about for his closing statement in the yearbook? Sure, he's class president, but he's never done anything really interesting of note. (Hanging about with his two best friends doesn't count.) Of course, as in almost every film these days, a twist is necessary to get the plot going, and that twist is the arrival in Matt's neighbourhood of Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). Matt is as struck by her looks as she is by his innocence.<br/><br/>Some American critics have written about how The Girl Next Door seems like a 21st century Risky Business (an early '80's Tom Cruise flick). I can't make the comparison, but what I can do is state that yes, Matt does get involved in some very risky business, especially with Danielle's ex (Timothy Olyphant) and a host of others in her life.  Her life, in fact, is far more different from his than he could possibly imagine. (A hint to what her life is about can be found in the subject matter of the 1999 documentary with the same name as this film - although if you've read the previews, you probably know already.)<br/><br/>A number of things elevate this from moderate fun to guilty pleasure. One of them is the presence of some really funny background gags - while some don't work, you have to give the director credit for trying them. At least twice, when you think the film could end, it continues and becomes better as a result. Best of all, Elisha Cuthbert, in whom I found nothing special in magazine pictures, looks absolutely stunning here, so to speak. The chemistry between her and the affable Emile Hirsch is believable. The young actors in the film are that likeable (and funny) that you forgive the lapses into corniness. It gets to the point where you really want a happy ending, and you get it.<br/><br/>So what about the plot holes and the never truly credible story? This isn't art. It's pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less, with a good choice of tunes too. My advice is just to sit back, relax and enjoy. You might just be pleasantly amused, whether you are in your teens or not."

It doesn't have to be true-to-life to be true-to-life, it just has to have the general idea of boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl likes boy to coincide with real life for the audience to enjoy it. Its just really funny, and you just want to be one of the main characters, so everyone must see it, its a must-see movie! so every one must go and see it as they will be missing out if they don't. i mean, its a feel good movie that you just want to watch again and again and i will be going to see it again this weekend so there!"

","OK, I'll be the firs to to admit. There's only one reason I went to see this film - her name is Elisha Cuthbert. I know, I'm shallow, but I just felt like going to see her looking good for about 2 hours. Is that a crime? The only crime here is that this film has been judged according to the main actress, when to my surprise, this was actually a very entertaining, funny and heartwarming film.<br/><br/>I expected the usual fare that has been seen oh-so-many times before. Yes, you can guess what happens in terms of the romance, (boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again) but there was just more to this film than the others I have seen from the same genre. (You would have to class this as teenage romantic comedy I'm afraid.) Elisha is very good as an ex-porn star trying to lead a normal life, and Emile Hirsch is a very good choice as Matt, the intelligent student guy who wants to be cool, but for me the best performances are by Matt's two best friends, Eli and Klits. (with a K!) Eli had me in stitches a few times.<br/><br/>Also, the film's music was excellent. Look out for the soundtrack, should be a very worthwhile purchase.<br/><br/>Overall, a very entertaining film that is well worth seeing.<br/><br/>

","The Girl Next Door is a really funny movie about a guy who for his whole life has played by the rules. Matt Kidman is a straight-laced guy who never does anything wrong until he sees the girl of his dreams. In his final year at high school, he decides to go a little wild. One night while taking out the garbage he sees a beautiful girl walking into the house next door. Danielle is the kind of girl that will and does change Matt's life; she turns his ordinary life into one crazy adventure after another. Soon the two bond and have a strong relationship. After a while he learns that Danielle is not who she says she is. Matt soon finds that his life is spinning out of control and the only one who can fix it is him. Now with the help of his friends he will go the limit and achieve something that no one ever though he was capable of doing. Up and comers Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert play the two leads in the film, their on screen chemistry is extremely well-matched. They are two great young actors who are perfect for their roles.  The film is very funny, a little predictable, but a good film in all. I give The Girl next Door a C + and 2.9 out of 4."

","When I think of directors in love with their female leads, I think of Hitchcock absolutely loving Grace Kelly with the lens of his camera, as in `Vertigo' or `Rear Window.' Not just making love to her, but truly, absolutely in the act of love with her; a true and honest act of creation and expression and fusing of acting and directing as forms of art. Elisha Cuthbert (Danielle) deserved such treatment with the subtlety and grace that she brought to this role, in addition to her breathtaking beauty, which is, I admit, rather obvious, hardly worth mentioning, like an earthquake. She was trying to give us something memorable, but it seemed the director wanted her to demonstrate her physical attributes (to fill the seats, I suppose); however, only at an arms length. Normally I would be okay with this approach if it was done intentionally to titillate and leave us wanting more. But in this case it seemed to be an inability for the director to grasp the material and develop a rapport with his actors and we were left squinting at the screen afraid to blink, thinking Elisha must be along any second.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie, despite some awkwardness and unevenness in the collage of high school life, was promising. I must say that the Cambodian exchange student sequence was brilliant.  At some point the story twisted in numerous madcap directions (and no, not like Tarentino, not even Three Stooges). Elisha took a back seat, and too many silly sidelines stifled the momentum and failed to propel the story. And the arcs that had been set up poofed away like mortar round duds fizzling overhead. The sputtering story and the inconsistent production values sucked all of the life out of the piece. It is disappointing that such wonderful, rife material could be so squandered.<br/><br/>Ms. Cuthbert often seemed to be in a different movie. She was always graced with the MTVesque light and shadow, with the ever present wisps and mist. However, many frames, especially at the beginning, only consisted of her alone without any of the other lead actors. Many of these frames were long shots which, to me, dissipated the intimacy between the viewer (me), and the material, as well as between the romantic leads. All of us, even the people in the movie, became voyeurs, lusting after Elisha, with no apparent artistic intent. In later scenes she was completely in the background, more as a concept or idea, or maybe ideal, rather than an actual person. However, there were some scenes, especially those at the beginning before we `knew' she was porn actress that she delivered masterfully. Even the scene in the motel room had its charm, though again here I think her raw talent completely overwhelmed the awkwardness of the director. I could almost tell the points at which she was under the influence of direction (i.e. went she removed her overgarment eyes completely downcast or went she assumed the doggie position and you couldn't see her eyes) and those in which she was riffing (i.e. went she was positioned direct and uncompromising or at the moment she detached herself from the childish game Emile's character was playing, honestly, though awkardly). I must say that I gasped for air when she said `Do you want to f**k me.'<br/><br/>Although the beginning of the film worked nicely, the editing did seem irregular, which I took as artistic intent. However, it appears from the `make it up as you go along' quality that took over when Emile's bud discovered the damning movie, there may have some re-shoots and added material and/or numerous disjointed, assembly line direction and production droids. I couldn't tell if it was the story that had gotten off course or if the editing was just completely outside the loop (pun!).<br/><br/>I did become fixated upon Ms. Cuthbert who seemed to want to do justice to the promising material. But she was overshadowed by the corporate collaborative who wanted to throw in a lot of silly gags, ill conceived t&a, and mangled plotlines. It was obvious, this was a corporate effort giving a golden boy a shot, actually setting him up for success, and the poor guy just couldn't bring it off. There may have been focus groups involved in the ending, which was typically American as Emile (Matt) cruised into Georgetown driving a spiffy sports car, silver, no less. I took this sendoff as homage to the movie's precursor, `Risky Business.'"

","What starts as a halfway decent update of ""Risky Business"" loses its' way and cannot maintain the attempts at style made for the first 40 minutes or so.  After that, it doesn't fall completely apart, though.  Emile Hirsch is a shorter, and less able, version of Tom Cruise (as another young man about to move on to a predictably successful and boring)college career, but Elisha Cuthbert (TV's 24 ) is the main event, and manages to turn on the sex appeal for much of that first forty minutes.  After that, Timothy Olyphant is not too bad at basically being `Guido the Killer Pimp,' and, while Hirsch and Cuthbert's relationship grows more strained, Hirsch's two buddies (Chris Marquette's porn obsessed Eli and Paul Dano (L.I.E.) as the geeky Klitz) are fun to watch, sustaining much of the rest of the film.  Nice, though, to think that anyone in Hollywood these days would consider remaking a Risky Business, instead of the more blunt and simple minded Porky's films."

Now I'm not so generous, probably because I can't stand all things we've seen a hundred times in other teenage flicks.<br/><br/>But let's begin with the good: for us boys, there's lots and lots of nice views in this movie! Elisha Cuthbert as Danielle is probably the most beautiful and sexy actresses gracing the silver screen today. Even if we don't get any frontal nudity from this future superstar, we see a bit more of Danielle's porn star friends ;-) You girls will also get your share though: Timothy Olyphant as Kelly has a rock star charisma that I think few girls will be able to resist. For girls that don't find dangerous men sexy there's always Emile Hirsch as Matt, although I don't see any star quality in him personally.<br/><br/>The plot was quite different from what I expected, which is a good thing. I certainly like to be surprised, but that's why I got so annoyed by all the cliches that are still left. Yes, there will be standing ovations when love is declared and yes, it all ends with a magical prom night. Some of these scenes made me cringe in my seat and certainly hurt my enjoyment.

Elisha Cuthbert (woefully underused in 24) gets her chance to shine and is fantastic.  Drop-dead gorgeous and she can act as well.  It's a shame that for a 15 (in the UK)-rated movie we get to see so little of her amazing body.<br/><br/>The story is fairly predictable, although the director does try to fool us now and again by including the odd scenes that turn out to be a dream or fantasy.  There is an occasional flash of violence that seems a little out of place but otherwise it's all good fun, albeit a little raunchy for the more conservatively-minded.<br/><br/>The story reminded me just a little of 1968's The Graduate, and the excellent soundtrack ranges back to the 60s with Donovan and Thunderclap Newman, and right up to today with David Gray."

","This film is just about as good as teen comedy gets. It has everything, from the sordid to the subtle, in the way of humour. The story is well-worn but seems fresh. It is funny and is also engaging, thanks to good writing and a very good cast. The movie overall is not a classic or anything, but definitely showcases two new talents to great effect. I have read another British reviewer who has likened Emile Hirsch to Leonardo diCaprio. To me he seemed more like a combination of Ewan Macgregor and someone who I can't quite recall. He is really good in this movie, bringing the kind of youthful screen presence more associated with older, established stars. His comic timing is excellent, and he is surely a big name for the future. The supporting cast are all effective and engaging, including Timothy Olyphant, who is likeable even when we see his character's nasty side. Which brings me, finally, to Elisha Cuthbert...I haven't watched '24' so was totally unfamiliar with her. All I can say is that there are elements of Marilyn Monroe here.  A sparkling talent for comedy, combined with both the natural and sexy appeal of Monroe, she simply can't fail in dismantling the crowns of every other pretender aspiring to be the Queen of Hollywood. She is a competent actress, whose looks may in fact thwart her acting abilities, but that's life. Meryl Streep got the roles, but Cuthbert can't help it if she looks like Aphrodite. Actually, 'Goddess' is an insult to her. My God, what a woman! Oh yes, the film....6 out of 10, which is good in my scale. 19 out of 10 for Miss C."

Emile Hirsch does a great job portraying a nervous teen trying to get the girl.  He is what most high school boys are: nervous most of the time, trying to act cool, trying to learn how to approach a girl, and worrying about college.<br/><br/>

","The Girl Next Door is a perfect example of the lack of perception that movie studios sometimes operate with. When test screenings reportedly went through the roof, Fox knew it had a potential hit on its hands, and set out to market the hell out of it. It was important, though, how they marketed it--because though GND is a successful high school teen comedy, it's not necessarily a sex comedy. The trailer for the movie wants to promote a cross between Risky Business and American Pie, with a dash of porn tossed in, and so the advertising pushes the sex aspect, even though it's NOT what the movie's about.<br/><br/>The Girl Next Door begins by evoking the feeling of dread that 99% of us get as we wind into the spring of senior year--that taste of emptiness that starts to fill the place in our minds we'd been saving for the kind of nostalgic memories that you write about in your last yearbook. Emile Hirsch is Matthew Kidman, dealing with this same problem as a potential Georgetown attendee with political aspirations who feels like he's missed out. And he pulls it off. He's neurotic, repressed, frustrated and scared all at once.<br/><br/>And then Elisha Cuthbert moves into the neighborhood to shake things up.<br/><br/>Cuthbert is Danielle, the ex-porn star with a heart of gold who's looking for a fresh start. Naturally, Matthew and Danielle hit it off; she shows him how to have all the fun he's been missing, and he gives her the confidence and courage to believe in starting over. Naturally, problems ensue when Matthew's academics begin to disintegrate.<br/><br/>Timothy Olyphant plays scene stealer as Danielle's porn agent, and Chris Marquette and Paul Dano fill out what could have been hollow supporting roles as Hirsch's buddies to give the movie a deeper overall feel. While the spin on Risky Business is obvious and moments of sentimentalism and ludicrousness make you groan at times, it's always compensated for and ultimately overpowered by the movie's acute sense of pathos--it knows what should be endearing and what should be funny about a coming of age experience that features a porn star (i.e. three high school kids at a convention for the adult film industry in Vegas).<br/><br/>As a comedy, The Girl Next Door is funnier than most anything out so far this year (save Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine). In terms of box office, the problem maybe seems to stem from the fact that Cuthbert's star was skyrocketing before the movie was ever in theaters, compelling Fox's marketing department to push the focus in the wrong direction. But the bottom line is that this movie is the first quality teen comedy to dramatize end-of-high-school anxiety since Ferris Bueller's Day Off. And if you think about it, Cuthbert's character is no more ridiculous than Ferris. (Seriously, did you ever know someone that EVERYONE liked in high school, who could get away with anything? Me either.) Go see this movie."

","Everyone looks for something different in a movie.  Some people want to be frightened, some people want to be mentally challenged, some people want to be shocked.  Personally, the kind of movie that I like most is the one that leaves with a good feeling not just as you leave the theater, but for the rest of the day.  Girl Next Door did that for me.  Let me start by saying that I'm not a high school kid who wishes that I had more fun and crazy times, and I'm not a college kid lamenting missed opportunities in high school.  I'm just a regular 20-something, the demographic at which I can only assume this rated R film was aimed (they don't make any money off under-aged teens sneaking in after buying a ticket for another movie.).  I think what made this movie so enjoyable was not high school reminiscence but two very valuable take home messages.  First, sometimes the greatest things that happen to us are the ones we don't expect.  Second, at the end of the day, its not money, prestige or accomplishments that really make us happiest, but people.  Will this movie solve any of your life's problems? I doubt it.  However, you will get some solid laughs and you'll leave the theater feeling good about the fact that sometimes in life, despite ups and downs, everything comes together to make something great.<br/><br/>I would feel remiss if I didn't also say something about the greatness that is Elisha Cuthbert.  I watch a lot of movies, and movies are chock full of really beautiful women (perhaps one of the reasons I watch so many movies). Elisha is a cut above the rest.  Way above the rest.  In fact, if you are Elisha Cuthbert, and you have penchant for talking about how great you are, feel free to send me a message, and I would be happy to oblige.  Seriously though, it went beyond appearance and to how she played the role.  I think she did an impressive job of creating a character that was at the same time sympathetic but also believable.  I think the movie overall was both well cast and well acted.  A movie that aims at humor/drama/romance can easily come out cheesy or just not funny.  In this case, I think that the movie is all kinds of funny but certainly doesn't overdo it, and the actors deserve credit for that.<br/><br/>Before I conclude, I think that I should say something about claims that this movie is just a rip off of classic 80's movies.  Personally, I have to disagree.  I know the classic 80's teen drama's quite well.  I watched from about 100 yards away as John Hughes and company filmed Cameron and Ferris launching the infamous Ferrari into the ravine (my friends and I used to go down there and look for Ferrari parts on weekends for years afterwards.). Risky Business was filmed primarily in the house of a family friend.  To those that think that Girl Next Door draws too heavily from movies like these, I can say only this: you see what you are looking for.  If you go into a film thinking that it will be a rip off, nine times out of ten you will see it as a rip off.  If you go in with an open mind, you may enjoy it more than you thought.<br/><br/>Of course, these are all just the opinions of one man.  Well, to be fair, me and the group of 15 year olds in front of me at the box office that all bought tickets for The Prince and Me and then snuck into Girl Next Door and ended up sitting in front of me.  They seemed to like it a lot too.<br/><br/>10/10 - purely for providing me with some of the best fun I have had in a theater in months, and if you knew me, you would know that is saying quite a lot."

","After reading eberts review I thought, it might not be worth watching but had nothing better to do. I gave it 9/10, would have given 10/10 as it was the best movie that I have seen so far this year, but there was too much violence to my liking. I found it better than American Pie/Dumb & Dumber. However, that is probably because I am a hopeless romantic (and also still/again single) and when I was a teenager, one of my favorite films was Can't buy me love (1987).. ..the kind of romantic girls/women there is on films, I don't think exists at all in real life. Too bad. But fun to watch films with such and dream of one."
"get_to_the_choppa","7","0","0","13 April 2004"," Comedy + Drama + Romance = Ultimate Teen Movie
","First off, this film was surprisingly better than i expected, obviously when compared with other teen comedies... why does 'American Pie' come to mind? I did see the trailer before watching the movie because i was rather intrigued with the plot (i also liked the imdb tagline 'he never saw her coming... but all his friends had', genius!). Anyway, to get to the point, the trailer made me chuckle, however, i was expecting the same result as 'American Pie 2'... where the only scenes that were remotely funny made up the trailer. In the end, this wasn't the case and for that alone, the movie does not deserve as much criticism as it has received.<br/><br/>The only flaw to the movie i can think of is that Elisha Cuthbert far is too beautiful to be a pornstar but her evident ability to act made the part that bit more believable together with the apparent perception of chemistry between the two leading roles (Hirsch & Cuthbert). Whilst they managed to uphold the romantic and dramatic side of the movie, the inclusion of side characters, most notably Eli (Marquette) and Kelly (Olyphant), brought out a major chunk of the comic influence that had me and others around me laughing non-stop from start to finish. Even the smaller roles (e.g. Samnang) were fully justified by the response they receive rather than the part they play in the development of the storyline.<br/><br/>The overall ending was not as predictable as first thought, with the exception of the two main characters winding up together... which can be forgiven as otherwise the first 1hr 30 of the movie would have been completely pointless. There was 1 plot line and for those who thought otherwise, all i can say is you must have been confusing 'The Girl Next Door' with the hotdog tell you to go to the lobby before the movie started along with all the other needless trailers. If there was anything to be upset about it was people laughing at jokes from the trailer... i've never understood why people do that, pretending as though they've never heard the joke before. But i digress to the point of saying that all reviews are merely subjective and we can all expect that this movie is not going to win any oscar's but if i were to pick a teen movie for someone in need of a laugh, this would be without a doubt my choice."

","I tend to be pretty critical of teen movies, but I went to see this one and it greatly exceeded my expectations. It was fun, sexy, and overall enjoyable. The plot was surprisingly original and not the least bit cheesy or overdone. It was provocative in many ways.The way I considered most important was the introduction of the new level of truly doing anything for love. The acting was very realistic, and the love scene in the limo was truly touching. I've read some harsh criticisms of this movie, whether it be about the ""base, unoriginal plot"" or the ""decay of our moral standards."" To the critics, loosen up a little and take things less seriously. It's not meant to be some satire on the downfall of society leading to a global epiphany, and if you want to discuss moral decay, take a look at the effects of your cynicism on your sphere of influence, whatever that may be. As for this movie, I'd recommend it to teens everywhere. 2 Thumbs Up."

","I went to see this movie for one reason - Elisha Cuthbert on a Big Screen. ( I second Mitch after Mitch-a-palooza, ""I Love You."" ) If the previous parenthetical sentence makes no sense rent 'Old School' already! I enjoyed this movie - it was funnier than expected.  Every musical cue, perfect for the scene that it fleshed out. The beginning of this movie would have worked better if the previews did not let everyone know that Danielle,  Mitch & Me in unison, ""I Love You"", was a porn star.  This fact already being known blunts the effectiveness of this surprise.  It is because of this that the beginning of the movie seems like just a setup until we get to the meat of the movie when Danielle's secret is discovered and hilarity ensues.  The interaction between the trio of friends, Matt, Eli & Klitz at times feels like Kyle, Stan & an unmuffled Kenny from South Park, in other words caustic, infantile and most importantly very funny.  The ending of the movie has a similar feel to the end of 'Risky Business'.  It is not a duplication of plot but of atmosphere.<br/><br/>If you are expecting Oscar level writing or are easily offended don't bother.  But for EVERYONE ELSE if you are looking for some laughs and a very funny movie, once 'Girl Next Door' heats up it will not disappoint."

","At least you have to give the writers credit... they chose a damn good movie to model itself after (and when I say ""model after"" I basically mean ""copy."")  Sure there are a few changes: the prostitute is now a porn star and the pimp is now a porn producer, but this film screams RISKY BUSINESS the whole way through.  I probably laughed harder and more frequently during this film, but RISKY BUSINESS didn't exactly resort to any cheap gags (i.e. horny high school boys at a porn convention is Las Vegas) to get its laughs.  However, this movies definitely worth seeing for the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert (who should have had more screen time) alone.  But you'll be pleasantly surprised to find some decent performances, plenty of laughs, and no gross-out humor in an overall fine comedy with some heart to boot."

Emile Hirsch is great and believable Matthew Kidman, Timothy Olyphant is one of my favorite villains in a comedy (perfect sleezball), and Chris Marquette and Paul Dano were hilarious as Matthew's two nerdy best friends. The movie all in all was really cute and funny. It made me think about high school and what memories I'll have when I'm done. This is definately gonna be a classic teen comedy for me.

","""The Girl Next Door"" was an obvious remake of ""Risky Business"", though re-vamped and changed so that in the end, everyone is happy and they have done good.  In fact, the twist at the end is pretty good and caught most of the people in the theater off guard.  The acting reminds me of any of a hundred other ""coming of age"" movies that have been made since the 80's. Some pretty good moments, nothing real special.  The brightest point in the movie was, without a doubt, Elisha Cuthbert.  I haven't watched ""24"" so I have never seen her before, but I have to say that she is well worth going to see the movie for.  Even though the movie probably didn't require her to tax her acting abilities, she was able to convey quite a bit just through her facial expressions.

","I just saw this movie about an hour ago, and I walked into the cinema expecting another ""American Pie"", or a similar Hollywood teen flick cliché, and I guess, to a certain extent my expectations were correct, but I did find this movie rather entertaining. To me it was like an 'upgraded' teen flick... Ok, it's not a movie with a deep meaning, exeptionally good actors, it's quite average, but I repeate myself, I was very entertained, which is all a movie like this is made for, to entertain with simplicity. And sometimes that is good, sometimes i enjoy watching movies where I don't have to think, sometimes I like to laugh at simple jokes, and this is one of those movies which you do this too, that's what I liked about it.

","Any person that believes that this movie is an accurate picture of our society today should have their genitalia removed.  Seriously, can't anyone just go to the movies and have an enjoyable experience without some nit-picker telling you how American women are easy going and very sexual. Do you know that in foreign countries such as Amsterdam, people have thousands of sexual partners? You wanna talk about loose women, don't talk about American women.<br/><br/>I'm not going to waste my energy anymore.<br/><br/>When I went to go see the movie, I had heard that the plot paralleled with Risky Business or American Pie.  While the film contained some of the elements of each, you really can't compare them. Yes I know that the plot is the same in Risky except with a porn star, but this was still better.<br/><br/>In my opinion, American Pie was just an excuse to give us Shannon Elizabeth naked (and I'm not saying that's a bad thing.)  But if you want to talk about the epitome of teen life, American Pie just doesn't do it.  Yes, a large majority drink at parties and many have sex.  American Pie really didn't offer the character development that Girl Next Door offered.  In my opinion, it was better for me to relate to Emile Hirsch's character rather than Jason Biggs.<br/><br/>The casting director should be given a reward for finding one of the most attractive and talented actress in Hollywood right now.  Not only did she blow me away with her striking good looks, but her acting was truly wonderful.  She played every aspect of the role well and made a convincing Want-to-get-out-the-business porn star.<br/><br/>At the beginning, when we first met Eli, the sex-crazed friend of the main character, I could tell he would be a riot to watch.  All his one-liners and drawn out speeches were hilarious. Masterful comedic timing enhanced every line and had me rolling in my seat.<br/><br/>Bottom line, great piece of cinema.  Not quite your typical sex comedy, but it's a good thing we've gone away from the American Pie type of movies and gone back to more witty and classy times."

","One of the key elements to making a memorable film is knowing your demographic.<br/><br/>In the 1980's no film maker demonstrated this ability with greater savy than John Hughes. His films not only launched careers and packed in box office receipts; they also spoke to a generation and helped define a cadre of actors who, to this day, still dominate their profession.<br/><br/>In 2004, its hard to say exactly who to consider when awarding the title of heir-apparent. `The girl next door' director, Luke Greenfield, seems to have crafted a gem that's worth the price of admission. But this relative unknown, whose previous efforts included Rob Schneiders 2001 effort, `The Animal', is also working with a strong script and well cast talent.<br/><br/>
One of the underlying themes of `The girl next door' deals with the idea of updating school teaching material, an interesting thought given that the film itself can be considered much in the same way. The cast comment on how `Someone should update these films', while viewing an outdated sex-ed movie from the 1950's. `The girl next door' is as updated, in comparison, as its counter parts, `The Breakfast Club', `Sixteen Candles' and `Weird Science'.<br/><br/>	 Young stars, Emile Hirsch (The Emperors Club, 2001) and Elisha Cuthbert (Old School, 2003) both give credible performances and may very well look back fondly one day on this film as a ground breaking performance in their respective careers. Timothy Olyphant (Rockstar, 2001, Dreamcatcher, 2003) is likewise, both easily hateable, yet roguishly charming (a la `Han Solo') in his role as Hirsch's tough ex-boyfriend/boss. <br/><br/>Crafted by individuals who obviously recognize that this generation accept sex and nudity without the hang-ups of the Hughes generation, `The girl next door' speaks expertly and with a cunning tone that, while it probably won't see any Oscars, may give Greenfield the first sleeper hit of the year.<br/><br/>

While American Pie was predictible, it had some funny parts. This movie had no funny parts, and I swear I predicted the movie's general conflict, 'twists', and resolutions in the first five minutes.<br/><br/>The director, as well as the writers, had no idea where they were going. I left the theater with the impression that they had 17 different ideas of what the plot line should be, at which point they jumbled them together and figured no one would notice if you got to see a nipple.<br/><br/>
There were opportunities to make American Pie style jokes, but they were missed. The attempts were pathetic, and the child molestation joke was seriously appalling.<br/><br/>Plus, you never get to see her naked.

","The Girl Next Door (2004) (***/****) Director: Luke Greenfield Starring: Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant<br/><br/>I must say that entering this movie I had the lowest expectations, which may have been the reason I found the movie so good. To begin, I feel that this movie, although seemingly stretched thin in parts, recaptures the familiar ""teen movie"" days of such classics as ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Say Anything"" which embody both a dramatic and comedic end to the story. Although those movies had a more flowing comedy/drama script than this, I also feel that the director did a remarkable job, I was impressed with the filming of this movie very much, and it was quite imaginative. Some down points that I noticed were the usage of the clichéd ""dream"" scenes or whatever they are called, this only made certain scenes confusing because I wasn't sure as they played out whether they were a dream or not. Also, Timothy Olyphant's character seemed to change sides too frequently, and I was never quite sure whether or not he was genuine or merely tricking the main character again. I felt Emile Hirsch presented another great performance, and made his character truly believable. Also, I found the character Eli, played by Chris Marquette, to be one of the funniest I have seen in this genre of film (his ending scene was absolutely hilarious). I just feel this movies only drawback was that it seemed to jump around too often, from location to location, from comedy to drama, and from stressing Matthew's (Hirsch) relationship to Danielle (Cuthbert), to stressing the importance of his friendship to Eli (Marquette) and Klitz (Dano).<br/><br/>Overall, I would say it was a movie worth seeing for a funny, far out there movie which still has the ability to strike a chord in the heart."

Early on the film has the feel of those great 80's teen sex movies and even uses traces of the Risky Business score. And even though the film does go off course a little towards the end, I can't help but appreciate the cast throughout.

This movie was great in showing the growth of the characters throught the movie, particularly Matt. Its an inspiring tale about how people very much unlike you can change you for the better.

But this film completely exceeded them. I could have gone in with high expectations and still been completely satisfied but going in with slighter expectations has left me completely astounded everything about this film screams professionalism. As it starts off with a collage of High School life done to yearbook pictures and nostalgic music of mostly anyones childhood. it's the feelings it brings forth that inspires memory and classic nostalgia. your only wishing at this point that the film could keep up this feeling through out it and does it one better and creates something completely original, somewhat magical and totally believable.  But as for the films plot which is filled with more depth that you can hardly imagine. It opens with a young man whom is questioning his HS years and their lack of enertaining memorabilia. Than enters the girl next door a young woman played by the beautiful and completed talented Elisa Cushbert of 24 and she is a stunner believe me when I say that. He meets her, she meets him issues ensue and she decides to give him the memories he's in search of just because of the innocent way he looks at her. But she has a secret you see she's no ordinary girl she's actually a porn star whom just quit her job trying to find a more suitable and respectful career. One she has settled into because a lack of better choices and because of the way she's always been treated. Now with the synopsis I am gonna completely stop there because to give anymore away would be wrong and if I did you'd probably be like what the hell is this? and never see it. But trust me it's worth any price you would pay and completely worth a viewing. The film is completely layered and three dimensional. It's beautifully written and the characters and their performances are smart and sexy. Although the film appears to be a sex comedy it's that  sex appeal that it usues to draw you in and than drops you over on it to teach the audience an apporpriate and heartfelt lesson. With all the cliches and silliness pushed to the absent side. The performances, direction and writing are all inspiring and you can expected to see these talented faces and names headline cinema for years to come. This film rocks it's almost everything you could want of in a movie. As it moves along it gets better. And when it ends your completely satisfied and you will carry a well deserved smile through the entire day following and whenever you decide to discuss it. Intelligent, provocative, sexy, funny, dramtic, emotions these are all things that describe this film but I'll use the credo that one character lives by and passes it on to others.

But the seamy subject matter, isn't off putting, because the smart script offers life lessons and insight that is rare in today's teenage sex comedies.    Like Cruise's film, this movie is about a likeable high school dweeb who dreams about 2 things ; getting into a prestigious college, and hooking up with hot babes.  Using RB as a blueprint, the film's arc is familiar, but still vastly entertaining. Clever, funny dialogue, energetic performances, and real sweet chemistry between Elisha and newcomer Emile.  Does it need to be emphasized again about how stunningly gorgeous Ms Cuthbert is?  Wow.  I'm in love.  Movie even uses a couple of songs that were heard on Risky Business soundtrack. Enjoy.  Thanks for reading.  Bye."
"tom-456","5","0","0","9 April 2004"," so-so remake of Risky Business
","The similarities in the story with Risky Business are so strong as to be unmistakable.  There are some differences, mainly in the sweetness of the relationship between the main characters Matthew and Danielle.  This made the movie somewhat enjoyable, but all in all, the story was simply lacking in original elements.  I like Elisha Cuthbert, but I think that in this case the casting of her in this role was based on her present appeal and not because she was the best actor for this particular role.  She does a very good job, but it is still just too hard to believe her as a porn star. Maybe it would have been more believable if she hadn't been so sweet (if it is possible for Elisha to not be sweet) but then if she hadn't been sweet, it would have been hard to believe that Matthew would have fallen for her. This suggests a fundamental problem with the concept, which is no surprise, but it still would probably have come off better if the Danielle character had been cast with someone a little more believable as a porn star.  Then again, what is going to sell this movie is not its believability, but the appeal of the two main characters for the teenage dating couples that will be the main audience for this movie.  I like Elisha (did I already say that?) but I don't think that this sort of light-heated comedy suits her, and I would much rather see her in a major role in a serious action-drama of some sort.  This sort of fluff is not going to do her any good, and she is far more talented, so she should try to skip past these sorts of roles and go straight for the first serious role that comes her way.<br/><br/>All in all, this is decent date movie for a older teens and younger twenty-somethings who don't object to the R-rated theme and the small dose of nudity.  You won't see Elisha nude, by the way, and I admire her determination to not cede to what surely must have been some very heavy pressure for her to appear partially nude."

","It was IMDB's description of this film that made me run out to see it this weekend and I quote from the IMDB daily news of 4/8/04 ""On another front, two new films aimed at female moviegoers will be battling it out -- 20th Century Fox's The Girl Next Door, and Miramax's Ella Enchanted.""  I'm going to go see ""Ella Enchanted"" next, but not since ""Mona Lisa Smile"" or ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" has my estrogen flowed with such vigor and that includes ""The Prince and me"" which was released just last week.  ""The Girl Next Door"" ushers in the chick flick for the 21st century!  Forget the Alamo folks;if Elisha Cuthbert is the new queen of the chick flick, then I want to climb aboard!"

","Guys remember the girl you had a crush on while still in high school? Well The Girl Next Door will turn your life upside down and inside out. It's like an 80's combined with a 90's movie.

Your high school experience will seemed tamed after this!!<br/><br/>I would strongly suggest leaving the young ones at home and go have an eyeful of laughs."
"frostedpinkcupcake","Null","0","0","4 April 2004"," Mixed Feelings.
","The Girl Next Door was a movie that I had mixed feelings about. One part of me thought the movie was going to be just another piece of teen garbage and the other half actually had hope for the film. I am very happy to say that the film was actually very good. This movie is not your average teen movie of course it does have a lot of sexual/porn jokes/references and nudity but it doesn't go overboard with the sex jokes. The most important element of the film was its meaning which is to live life to it's fullest and don't let the people around you control you. The plot wasn't too original but I enjoyed the film very much.<br/><br/>The film stars Emile Hirsch as Matthew Kidman,a straight arrow A+  student and his two friends Eli (Chris Marquette) and I think Klitz (Paul Dano), who are just entering their senior year of high school. Matthew and his friends have always been the geeks of the school and been the target of humiliation. Matthew has never really lived life and has never had a real sexual experience. So one day the ultra-gorgeous Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door and he immediately falls in love with her.  Matt thinks that Danielle is innocent and perfect. . .that is until he finds out she's a former porn star. When Matt's friends find out she's a former porn star, they try and convince Matthew to have a sexual experience with her. Ultimately, Danielle helps Matthew emerge from his shell and discover that sometimes you have to risk everything for the person you love -- as he helps her rediscover her innocence and true self. The film gives off a very good soundtrack with a mixture of many different types of music. I especially liked when Matt and his friends went to the porn convention. So as you can tell from the brief description of the movie, it does try to have its sexual jokes but aren't very offensive or sick like other teen movies. But most importantly to me is the end the film, which made a very good point. The movie was a very fun ride for me and I seen it many times already and enjoyed it after ever viewing. My final rating for the Girl Next Door would be a 7/10"
"ReevesBeckett","9","0","0","1 April 2004"," Great Sex Comedy with Heart
","The teen sex drama has been littered with movies that thought they could pull it off and they couldn't. The list of those that do it properly is small, but feel free to add The Girl Next Door to that list.<br/><br/>Let's get the easy stuff out of the way. Yes, Elisha Cuthbert is hot as hell. However, way more important than that is that this is a star-making performance. She was outstanding. Emile Hirsh plays Matthew, the uptight kid who gets his life changed by the porn star with a heart of gold and owns his role as well. The entire cast is great.<br/><br/>I have a few complaints but they are not enough to stop you from seeing this movie. <br/><br/>9/10"
"ten31isfun-shop","10","0","0","25 March 2004"," Homage to Risky Business...
","I loved this film! First let me add a disclaimer-- ""Risky Business"" is one of my top 5 movies of all time. I would be very easily jaded by any film that attempted to remake such a classic. But I was not jaded by ""The Girl Next Door,"" because- for once- they did not merely attempt to remake a great film- rather, they paid homage to one by making an equally entertaining movie in the spirit of ""Risky Business"" that speaks to a new generation. It is also a film worthy of comparison to some of John Hughes' classics like ""Weird Science"" and ""Pretty in Pink."" Sure, it has some minor structural flaws here and there, but, overall, this film is so funny, the characters so endearing, and the set pieces so outrageous that I was downright ready to jump out of my seat with excitement over how much fun I was having watching this. I haven't felt this way about a film in years! Come to think of it, I haven't felt this way about a film since I watched ""Risky Business."" Thanks for taking me back in time and reaffirming that those same emotions are still alive and strong today. And what a soundtrack!! Sneaker Pimps, Filter, The Who, The Verve, Marvin Gaye- coupled with songs from the great ""Risky Business"" soundtrack like Muddy Waters' Mannish Boy and Tangerine Dream cues as well. Who could ask for much more?-- Except maybe more Elisha Cuthbert! Rebecca DeMornay, time to step aside, I now remember what it feels like to be infatuated again. And a star making turn from Emile for sure. Great job to everyone involved. Studios execs, please take note- this is proof that the word `teenager' does not have to defined as dumb. Movie lovers- check this one out for pure, clever fun!"

","I was fortunate enough to gain free tickets to see the girl next door. And how pleased i was walking out of the cinema. It leaves you with a truly uplifting feeling inside.<br/><br/>From the look of the film you may think that you're in for another typical teen movie, boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl doesn't like boy, boy fights for girl, boy gets girl. However... this is not entirely the case.This film had far more twists in it than you might expect, and provides laughter throughout, with many hilarious scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, and Elisha Cuthbert gives a 'stunning' performance. I enjoyed this film more than american pie 2 (2 given that 3 was excellent) The girl next door overshot my expectations and had some wonderful camera work (just near the beginning - somewhat donnie darko like).<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended"
"zrweiss","10","0","0","27 March 2004"," A Refreshing Break from the Traditional Teen Comedy
","While although knowingly remaking Risky Business and containing elements from both American Pie and Weird Science, this movie is very unique and in a class of its own. While of course containing the hilarious raunchy behavior necessary for a teen comedy, it also contains surpisingly good acting, timely one-liners, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack.  The editing and use of music in this movie is amazing.  The story takes a look into the life of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an overlooked, overachieving high school senior who draws a blank when reflecting on his time in high school, shortly before graduation.  His life suddenly changes when Danielle (Cuthbert), a beautiful and free spirited teen moves in next door to house-sit for her aunt.  They immediately fall in love because they see things in each other that no one else sees.  Their relationship is thrown a curveball by Matt's discovery that Danielle is a porn star trying to find a way out.  The rest of the movie is Matt's quest to break Danielle out of the industry, much to the chagrin of her charismatic but overprotective porn producer Kelley (Olyphant).  The movie then takes many more twists and turns and Matt brings his nerdy but adventurous sidekicks along for the ride, thus providing many moments of comic relief. The movie has many endearing qualities, and belongs in a genre by itself.  All in all it is a great tale of living up to one's potential and can relate to people of all ages.  A must see"
"will-cooper","Null","0","0","24 March 2004"," my take on this film
","I kind of liked this movie when I saw it at a sneak preview but read some of the comments about it and honestly have to agree.  Especially about the part where the man said that playing Baba O'Reilley doesn't make this a teen coming of age movie.<br/><br/>I thought the movie had a lot of similarities to Risky Business and actually tried to modernize it.  In fact, there were a few scenes where I heard music similar to Tangerine Dream's ""Love on a Train"" song.  Eerie.<br/><br/>
I can't saw the movie was completely good, but it was entertaining. I thought that some of the content honestly was offensive.  The movie is supposed to be about high school students and one director visits a school and attempts to recruit actresses...how realistic (and cool???) is that really?  Kinda sick.<br/><br/>Also some of the characters were charicatures...like the moviemaker or the insecure bespectacled social misfit type.  And going to Vegas?  Hmmm. Kind of jumped around a bit.<br/><br/>It did try and have a message...which I thought way too many teen movies have all asserted numerous times before.<br/><br/>I grew up in the 80's when the teen movie genre was at its apex (or so it seemed) and I look back at many of those films and wonder how even a young adult could attempt to find some depth in any of those films.  Or consolation.<br/><br/>About this movie compared to Risky Business...at least Risky Business to me at the time...seemed to have some maturity about it.  The kids had a certain wisdom and the movie had a certain method to it...one which seems lost in many of today's films (which are churned out in the 1000's every year).<br/><br/>Also, the movie had a predictability to it.<br/><br/>Overall though...it's kind of a cute film...I didn't get bored...although I wonder about the intended audience."

","Caught a preview screening of this last night. I admit there are moments that had me laughing a LOT. But there were also two key parts that I felt were weak and detracted from the overall film. If you like comedies about high school graduation high jinx this one won't disappoint you at all. If you are expecting a cerebral comedy there is very little of that here.<br/><br/>The plot is very similar to Risky Business. Missing is the Reagan-era back-stabbing overtones replaced here with general thuggery. The Girl Next Door also contains homo-erotic moments that Risky Business would never have gotten away with in the conservative '80s.<br/><br/>The two leads do a great job with the material they are given. Elisha Cuthbert is indeed fantastic... a fact that 24 has not yet fully exploited. Here we get to see more of her AND more of her talents. Never once did I say.. ""Hey look! It's Kim from 24! Watch out for that cougar!""  (However there were parts when I wanted someone to mimic Rebecca DeMournay's famous Risky Business line ""I want to make love on a real train""... the two films are THAT similar in tone.) Emile Hirsch is a talented kid that I had not heard of before. He does a great job here and his comic timing (already very good) should be excellent someday.<br/><br/>The film is filled with a bunch of secondary characters all played by worthy actors who do great jobs bringing more than stereotypes to life. There are some great tunes in the soundtrack... promising a nice CD collection I'm sure and the cinematography and other production values all get high marks. -Mattro"

","I do not normally comment on here but I felt compelled to having read some of the views expressed previously. I was invited to a preview screening of the film a couple of days ago and was very impressed. Im not quite sure why I liked the film so much, as I normally despise movies of this genre., and to be honest, the thought of sitting through a couple of hours of teen movie drivell really did not appeal, so considering the fact that my gaurd was well and truly up before the film began, I was surprised to find myself leaving the auditorium with a sense of satisfaction.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I was reminded of Ferris Beulers' Day Off and the original American Pie, the latter of which is an inferior title to The Girl Next Door, which relies largely on 'gross out' humour, rather than the wit and charm displayed here."
"bdupay","Null","0","0","26 March 2004"," Can't Say Enough Good Things
","I don't know what movie was ""God-Awful"" but it certainly wasn't this one. I went in expecting your standard fare teen-dramady, and came out unable to stop talking about how good it was.  From the very first scene, I was laughing out loud almost constantly.  The story and main characters may seem a bit formulaic at first, but throughout the course of the movie display a remarkable amount of depth and individuality that most movies like this lack.  On almost every occasion where the writers and actors could have taken the easy way out and pandered to the low brow expectations of the audience, they instead took it a different route that gave the film more substance and character.<br/><br/>This film had humor, but it also had a lot of heart that did not feel spoon-fed.  Sure, you've got the very John Cusack-esque main character, some wacky sidekicks, and a lot of eye-candy, but the lead actors really do get you invested in the outcome of their story.   Emile Hirsch and Timothy Olyphant gave especially strong performances, and Elisha Cuthbert was not only lovely as ever, but able to portray a strong female lead instead of constantly being the victim as in ""24"".<br/><br/>One thing to highlight is the use of music in the movie.  Instead of the expected soundtrack of mind-numbing teen-pop that serves only as background noise, there was an interesting choice of a lot of older and more obscure songs.  The music served a purpose in setting the mood and atmosphere of the film, and did a remarkable job of adding to instead of detracting from the emotions and feeling of important scenes."

I must say, I was really surprised by how good this movie was.  it reminded me of the great movies of my youth (risky business, say anything, etc) the filmmakers really had a cool yet realistic vision of what it's really like to be in high school.  i laughed out loud all through it and i don't usually make a sound.  what i liked most was the fact that the kids seemed real to me.  they weren't popular, they weren't nerdy, they were the kind of kinds who make up the silent majority of high schoolers.  i loved watching their journey from adolescent immaturity to manhood.  sure, some things stretched the limits of credibility, but i didn't care.

"phillymjs","Null","0","0","22 March 2004"," Somewhat predictable, but entertaining nonetheless.
","I jumped at the chance to see this during its special ""Sneak Preview"" on Saturday, March 20th. It follows the ""Risky Business"" formula: Purely by chance, straight-laced, uptight boy meets sweet girl with troubled past. Girl teaches boy to let loose and have some fun, with disastrous (to him) results. Boy rescues girl from her past. Girl enlists help of friends to rescue boy's future. Along the way, they fall in love. Oh, and there's an oft- repeated catch phrase, as well. Despite the parallels to Risky Business, though, in my opinion there are enough differences here for the movie to stand on its own.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch was convincing as an awkward high-schooler, and Elisha Cuthbert (who looked amazing) was great as she switched back and forth between sex kitten and sweet next-door neighbor-- it was a very refreshing change from her character on ""24,"" who (this season) is so annoying and lacking in common sense that it makes me cringe every time she appears on the screen. Timothy Olyphant was very good in a ""Guido, the Killer Pimp""-ish role, playing the antagonist that you couldn't help liking even as he was trying to impede Hirsch and Cuthbert's developing relationship for his own selfish reasons.<br/><br/>This is one I'm thinking about seeing again when it opens nationwide in a couple weeks."

","The Girl Next Door, contrary to what you may think, is quite a good movie. It may come off as being just another teen movie and a cheap rip off of an American Pie, but it has its own unique characteristics that make it a respectable movie.<br/><br/>From an average guy's perspective this is what i thought of it. Decent plot but its supported by suprisingly good acting with a lot of comedy. The incredibly sexy female cast (Elisha Cuthbert joined by her 'pornstar' friends) is always a plus. Not to mention the terrific soundtrack that accompanies every scene to the movie. The movie leaves you with a good feeling inside and is very uplifting.

","I had the privilege of seeing this movie three weeks before it comes out to audiences around the world and it was perhaps the funniest and most genuinely uplifting movie I have seen in years.  Now perhaps my attraction to the heroine, Elisha Cuthbert or my rapport to the main character, Emile Hirsch blinded me to the trite plot, but this movie did not lack comedy. The only time I did not hear the entire audience laughing was when the credits were rolling.  Furthermore, while walking out of the theater I overheard numerous people wishing the movie came out sooner so they could go see it again.<br/><br/>I admit that one does not have to think during this movie, but thank god for that.  There are too many overly artsy, pseudo-intellectual, ""I think I'm smart because I go to this movie,"" Films today.  The Girl Next Door is fun to go to, has a wonderful plot, is written quite well and has amazingly good acting from a bunch of no names especially Timothy Olyphant.   Frankly, the person who doesn't like this movie is probably stick-in-the-mud that shouldn't be going to this type of movie anyway.  If you don't like witty comedy, original characters or a quick and smart plot, do not go to this movie."

","Don't believe the naysayers.  The Girl Next Door is a very good teen sex comedy/coming of age movie.  It doesn't exactly transcend this, but so what--it isn't trying to.<br/><br/>I guess the closest movie comparison I can make to this is Risky Business, but--though I haven't seen that movie in years--I felt like there was a much stronger emotional core to this movie than Tom Cruise's first big break.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch, as Matt, and Elisha Cuthbert, as Danielle, are both appealing leads in this film, both visually and emotionally.  They come across as likable and real, not cardboard cutouts of the ""bad girl"" or the ""overachiever"" that we're used to seeing in movies of this sort.  Those moments exist, but they're there for comedy as much as anything else. What really surprised me was that I could actually imagine these two people falling for each other ... though, I suppose I should say the surprise was more that I could see why Danielle might fall for Matt.  As played here, he's a genuinely good guy who doesn't know amazing he really is.  There's a quiet scene where he's explaining to Danielle how ""we"" raised money to bring a brilliant Cambodian student to study in America.  She asks, ""Who's we?"", and when Matt answers that it was basically him, there's a shrug and a kind of sense that he sees it as no big deal--wouldn't anyone have raised the money to help?  It's subtle and beautifully done.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast shines as well; there are no weak links.  Tim Olyphant, as Danielle's producer, is at turns both cool and sleazy as hell, and both fit his character like a rhinestone glove.  He has some hilarious moments here, and takes full advantage of them.  Paul Dano, as Klitz, is probably given the least to do, but he plays the reluctant, geeky friend extremely well, and the scene where he finally cuts loose is priceless.  James Remar does a good job of looking and acting like Hugh Hefner as he plays Tim Olyphant's old partner.  And finally, Chris Marquette's Eli is a work of genius.  He's The Girl Next Door's Jack Black, Jason Lee and Vince Vaughan (think Trent from Swingers) rolled into one and then reverse-aged to a high school student so that his presence doesn't seem completely out of place. His lines are some of the funniest and most outrageous in the movie, and he delivers them with spot-on accuracy.<br/><br/>Please don't dismiss this movie as simply another teen sex comedy.  It's at least as funny as the American Pie movies (without having to resort to gross out humor as the linchpin of the movie), and it has ten times the heart and soul."

This happiness did not stem from a good movie but rather Elisha Cuthbert. I wasn't aware how beautiful this girl was till this movie. She really did make the movie for me. Let me be honest, I am a sap for Romantic Comedies and when I first saw the trailer, it looked like the perfect movie. It had a beautiful girl and a nerdy boy in a funny but quirky situation who fall in love. The perfect Romantic Comedy.<br/><br/>As the movie goes on, it has many funny moments and I was rather entertained by it for the whole 2 hours. I'm not going to lie to you, this movie has its flaws. It seems like its going to end many times before it finally actually ends. I personally did not mind the movie going on as long as it did. It means more Elisha Cuthbert.

This flick has got a lot of heart and solid acting.  It's also very funny.  I dug it.  Cuthbert's character could have been fleshed out a bit more.

","A surprising movie.  It's got some silliness, some convenient answers and some glossing over... but more importantly it has a soul, and that overcomes those weaknesses.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsh plays Matthew, an overachieving ""A"" student, president of his Senior class and bound for Georgetown University and a big life as a politician down the road.  But when he tries to find a way to answer the yearbook question ""I will always remember..."", he fails miserably.  He has nothing to remember, because his life is too static.  He watches the jocks, and particularly the girls that the jocks are with, and wishes that he was enjoying this successful life of his a bit more.<br/><br/>And, as tends to happen in movies like this, when he gets his wish, it's almost too much to handle.  A beautiful new girl, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), moves into the house of her vacationing Aunt next door. Danielle strips in front of her open window--with an amazed Matthew watching from HIS window--and when she turns around and catches him she immediately re-dresses and comes over to confront him in front of his parents. But instead of telling on him, she uses the excuse that she's new in town and needs someone to show her around.  Danielle drives Matthew out to a mostly deserted street, kicks him out of the car, and insists HE strip for her.<br/><br/>Matthew does... and over the next few days finds himself increasingly involved with this mysterious girl.  For her part, Danielle seems to make it some kind of mission to loosen Matthew up, in a sequence of more and more daring ways.<br/><br/>But for all of Danielle's bad girl ways... she essentially still seems sweet and if not exactly innocent, at least normal.  She tells Matt that she's moved away from her old life and is just looking for a new start.  But Matt's impressions of her come crashing down when his somewhat sex-obsessed friend, Eli, pulls him aside and shows him a video tape.  Matthew's mystery girl is ON the tape. Matthew's girl is a teenaged porno star.<br/><br/>This is all just the setup--not all that deep into the film.  The REAL plot of the movie--the real heart--builds on this with how Matt deals with his new knowledge about Danielle, how Danielle deals with Matt, and what the film tries to tell us about who these people really are, as opposed to who they are expected to be.  Matt's pretty future comes crashing down around him, and Danielle's past threatens them both in the form of her former boyfriend/""producer"" Kelly (Timothy Olyphant).<br/><br/>The film is more reminiscent of ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" or ""Risky Business"" than more ""modern"" teen films like ""American Pie"" or even the wave of John Hughes films which came between these two.  Sex is ever-present, although the film is not explicit--with the exception of a few pairs of breasts in a strip club and some strong language and suggestion.  And the sex trades are neither panned nor lauded, although there are certainly implications that the teenaged Danielle has been exploited, and desperately needs to get out.  The moral center of the film has nothing to do with pornography though, it has much more to do with sacrifice, friendship, and the desire to better yourself.  And if it gets a bit heavy-handed near the end with some of this... it's given you enough to laugh and think about up to that point to deserve some leeway.<br/><br/>Of particular note in this film is Elisha Cuthbert, who does surprisingly more than her fairly wooden performance as Kim on ""24"".  Danielle could have been a glossy fantasy girl, played without depth or warmth, but Cuthbert brings both in spades.  Rather than be disgusted or even just excited by Danielle and her choices, Cuthbert allows us to see what it cost her, what she's managed to regain from Matthew, and what she fears losing again. It's a deep performance which is more the actress than the script, and it doesn't hurt that she plays the sexy parts extremely well too.<br/><br/>Also great is Chris Marquette, as Eli, who will give you quite a shock with his performance if all you know him from is his slightly sacharine role as Adam on ""Joan of Arcadia""."
"plasmawhore","10","0","0","18 March 2004"," Basically just an updated ""Risky Business""
","I've never bothered to comment, but I read the last persons comments and completely disagree.  This was a very good movie.  It's basically just Risky Business, but with porn stars, and no Balki Bartocamus.  Balki needs to be in more movies.  Someone should make a movie with Balki and Alf, and maybe that girl from small wonder.  Most of the monkies that watch movies in theaters will laugh at just about anything, but I found myself laughing along with them once or twice.  The only complaint I have is that Elisha Cuthbert didn't show her boobies.  She's playing a pornstar for f**ksakes, show some nipple!  Come to think of it, I don't think there was any nudity in this movie.  That last scene should have had her doing some Bukkake. Definately worth seeing. 8/10."

","Maddis - 4/10<br/><br/>Oh won't the tired old teen comedy beast stay in it's cave, roll over on it's back, raise it's four padded paws and utter a last warm dying breath so we can have something new...Not Yet...<br/><br/>Girl Next Door certainly had promise as the next American Pie, Last American Virgin, Risky Business, you name it cliché teen movie but fails to deliver in an over saturated plot with a great opening and mild peaks in performances.  Timothy Olyphant shines as the smart-witted, smooth, yet violent porn pimp.  Olyphant's character and relationship with Elisa Cuthbert is taken almost straight out of 1986's Something Wild with Melanie Griffith (free spirited victim) and Ray Liotta (crazed ex-husband) with Emile Hirche sitting in for a teen Jeff Daniels.<br/><br/>Regardless of the repeat plot themes, the movie had promise to show some originality but slips back into the ""need a laugh, show a teen in a sexually awkward moment"" filler for the overlong 110 minutes.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsh plays the sexually frustrated yet bland teen with a mix of college ambition and supportive parents, mixed with president of the school, mixed with sneaking out for a mid-morning beach trip character that will have you wondering ""will this character ever be consistent?"".  Hirsh holds the screen in the early stages but then seems a little too mature for the role he plays.  Suspending disbelief is one thing but you will continually ask yourself ""would such a smart teen realistically be put in these situations?""<br/><br/>Never quite finding it's ground the plot skips around from comedic fantasies played out in Matthew's head, to brushes with the porn pimp, to road trip, to prom, to X-rated video in the school locker room and finally back around to romance.  These scenes are interesting taken on their own but do not connect when put together.  The trailer smartly focuses on the fantasy, first-person aspect of the movie which would have played well had the filmmaker stuck with it.  The trailer combined with the 10-minute scene ""conveniently"" leaked over the internet did well to market this comedy as a must-see and certainly highlighted the best of the movie.  Instead we are jerked back and forth through the story almost as if shot by different directors.<br/><br/>Strong performances by Dano and Marquette although they both seem miscast with Hirsch.  Standing out awkwardly as a group, the only time these two supporting actors shine is when they are together alone.  A movie with these two and their misadventures might have been better.  Cuthbert is great on screen but certainly deserves a stronger lead that what this film offered. She will most certainly use this as a launching pad for better projects.<br/><br/>Sure to go straight to video after a short stint in the theaters, wait for a late night viewing of this movie on cable and steer clear of the sure to be dead-in-the-water sequel that will hopefully put this beast to death.<br/><br/>

","Walking in, I didn't expect much other than an easy way to end an otherwise boring day. Thanks to the ultra-gorgeous Ms. Cuthbert, I was able to put the day to bed on a high note. She shows much more range in THE GIRL NEXT DOOR then she's ever been allowed to show in 24. Without her, the otherwise formulaic RISKY BUSINESS clone wouldn't have been anywhere near as enjoyable.  It just goes to show you that a little charm goes a long way and can make for a truly sweet and endearing movie. <br/><br/>One would be remiss to let the amazing soundtrack go unmentioned.

","This movie is apparently coming out April 9 now; maybe they want to get more press first. I got to see a sneak preview, and this movie actually made me feel for the characters at the end. Strange, but true. It has bits of everything - drama, comedy, etc. Mostly too bizarre to be real but has a strange touch of believability. You'll probably be able to find some character in the story to relate to -- the nerdy kid, the popular guy, etc. I really did not think that this movie would be something I'd watch other than for Elisha Cuthbert (certainly, it doesn't hurt that she's mezmorizing), but I'd say on the whole it was really well done, and something completely different from what movies are like these days. This isn't a rehash of anything, so it's worth a watch."

","I saw this movie a couple of weeks go and definitely enjoyed it.  The acting is solid and there are a fair amount of good funny scenes.  There's some stuff that's a bit unrealistic, such as Matthew(Emile Hirsch) and Danielle(Elisha Cuthbert) hooking up in one night and falling completely in love in a couple of days, but for the most part their relationship/chemistry isn't too horrible.  The movie had a lot of stuff that could have been better, but it's still a fun movie without the typical gross out teen sex comedy stuff.  I would definately pay 8 bucks to watch this again when it comes out next month and recommend it to most teenagers and young adults. The story and relationship between Matthew and Danielle is good enough to make you forget the weak parts of the movie."

","I went to see an advance screening of this, wasn't expecting much, just free entertainment but it was surprising funny and well acted. Everyone there seemed to be enjoying it and the script was clever. Okay, so it doesn't deserve an oscar, but as a film for the same age group of American Pie lovers it's a great, fun movie. To be honest when I go to the cinema with mates this is the sort of this I enjoy, not the heavy stuff.<br/><br/>The two main actors are great, Eliza Cuthbert has the role down perfectly and his two mates provide good background humour. The film might be totally unrealistic and cheesy, and there aren't any particularly fantastically filmed scenes but it doesn't need it to be fun. Take it with a pinch of salt and go not expecting too much so like me you'll be pleasantly surprised."

","On Friday, I went to see The Girl Next Door with Benji because they were offering a sneak preview. The movie doesn't come out until March 12.<br/><br/>The worse part of it all is that I actually got free passes for this movie but decided not to go as the last minute. I didn't even realize that the movie I got passes for was this one. Because I had seen previous of this movie and I was dying to see it. Oh well . . . no use crying about it now.<br/><br/>
I have finally seen it and I have to admit that while my expectations were low, I was surprised with how funny, smart and fast-paced this movie turned out to be. Yes, it might be a bit convoluted at times and have too many things going on, but the movie handles that incredibly well. You are entertained every step of the way, the movie doesn't feel slow or long at any point and it's downright hilarious.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the only reason why I wanted to see this movie was because of Emile Hirsch. I first saw Emile in The Emperor's Club and was amazed at how good he was in that film. He played the cocky troublesome kid with such ease that I was instantly reminded of another younger actor who acted in a similar fashion: River Phoenix.<br/><br/>I really believe that if River hadn't died, he would be one of the greatest actors around. But since that's not to be, then someone else should take that title and I am convinced that Emile Hirsch is the Next Best Thing. Let's hope he makes the right role choices and projects that will ultimately advance his career. Because he has incredible potential and it would be a waste if he doesn't take it seriously.<br/><br/>Aside from having such charisma and charm on screen, the kid can act. He's not just a pretty face. And in The Girl Next Door he plays Matthew, a straight-laced senior high schooler who is getting ready for college but needs a scholarship to attend Georgetown, his university of choice. He follows the rules, he studies hard, he never parties and his life is on the right path.<br/><br/>That is, until he meets Danielle, who is housesitting next door. She disrupts his life but in a good way. She forces him to take chances, to take risks, to skip school, to enjoy life to the fullest.<br/><br/>Now all of a sudden his life has been derailed. But it's all good until he discovers that she is a former porn star. He is upset and handles it badly. He makes attempts to win her back but is confronted by her manager, Kelly, who will have none of her quitting the business. Timothy Olyphant plays the manager in a casual manner, as if it's not hard to envision him doing this on a regular basis. I was a bit appalled to see he got porcelain veneers over his crooked teeth (which you can see in ""Go""). They looked fake and much too big for his mouth. But anyway, Kelly is a scoundrel looking to make it big in the biz. And he considers Matthew very much an obstacle in achieving that goal.<br/><br/>Much hilarity ensues as Matthew attempts to win Danielle back, try to win the scholarship for college, try to fix all the messes Kelly has left behind. Amazingly enough, in the end, it all ties up very nicely. You are always cheering for Matthew and Danielle and enjoying yourself along the way.<br/><br/>I didn't expect to like Elisha Cuthbert in the role of Danielle. I had seen her before in the TV show ""24"" and I always considered her boring and vapid. But she was good here. Although I am not sure if I completely believe her to be the same age as Matthew as portrayed in the film, but that's neither here nor there.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie is you just want to see a smart comedy a la Risky Business/Ferris Bueller's Day Off (and no Matthew never speaks in the camera - Broderick was the only actor who could pull that off successfully and it should never be attempted again)."
"goodgodwhatabeatnik","8","0","0","9 March 2004"," An excellent moral play.
","The Girl Next Door: This film is directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) and written by David Wagner and Brent Goldberg (Van Wilder). From that information you might assume that this film is a generic mainstream comedy, and in that assumption you would be wrong. The Girl Next Door is an offbeat Romantic Comedy that defies the very genre that it is marketed to. Emile Hirsch (The Emperor's Club) stars as Matthew Kidman, a straight A college bound student whose life is turned upside down when he meets the Girl Next Door in question, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). Danielle catches Matthew staring at her changing through a window, and in punishing him they become friends. However, Matthew's pornography obsessed friend Eli (Chris Marquette) informs him that Danielle has a sordid past as a porn star. It becomes Matthew's goal to convince her that she's better than the pornographic industry, much to the chagrin of her producer Kelly (Timothy Olymphant). The Girl Next Door is a delightful comedy with much more than just teen raunch gimmicks. In fact, this film may be more suitable to an adult audience, which will appreciate the film's finer points a great deal more. The movie is a great romantic comedy with its morals in the perfect place, and is highly recommended. I'm debating on either a 7.5 or an 8, but I'll leave it at ****1/2 (A-) (8/10) for now."

","Caught this movie at a sneak preview tonight.  Probably wouldn't have gone if it wasn't free, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by it. It isn't art in any way shape or form, but it is highly entertaining.  The fantasies of the Matthew character (played by Emile Hirsch) are hilarious, like when he first discovers that Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) is a porn star and finds her on the couch with his parents. The interaction between the best friends is a lot of fun too, especially when they go to the porn convention in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>I really liked Elisha Cuthbert in this movie too.  I've never watched 24, so my only real exposure to her was as the boss's daughter in Old School and the ""Hot american girl who loves british accents"" in Love Actually. I'll admit that part of my liking her is because she's very very easy on the eyes, but she's able to play this role and have fun with it, which is always a plus. <br/><br/>And it also has an awesome soundtrack.  Gotta love a well placed inclusion of The Who. <br/><br/>Probably the best teen movie I've seen since the first American Pie."

","Just saw ""The Girl Next Door"" tonight, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The trailers made it look like a real teen flick, in the style of American Pie or Porkys or something, but that's not the way it came out. The acting was right on in every scene.  Even most of the secondary characters were just right.  The characters who really stood out were some of the secondary ones, like the main character's best friends and Danielle's producer.  The music fits great, and the movie twists in some good surprises.  My prognosis is that this movie is being marketed to the wrong audience ala ""The Rules of Attraction"" and that if it fails it's because it is being advertised to teen moviegoers, not older romantic comedy watchers."

But more surprising was Emile Hirsch, who I genuinely enjoyed seeing as the main character.  Unlike other movies I've seen recently (THE PERFECT SCORE, to be exact), Mr. Hirsch is actually quite interesting as the main character, which only serves to make his cohorts and supporting actors more interesting.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent film, for what it is, a teen comedy that's not holding back from situations that any teen comedy should be gunning for.

","I was shocked when my wife agreed to go see the sneak preview with me last night, and I anticipated seeing a teenie-bopper sex flick with lots of nudity, poor acting and a bad plot.  I was very pleasantly surprised that The Girl Next Door had such a funny, sexy edge that had us leaving the theater smiling and excited.<br/><br/>Elisha Cuthbert (you may know her as Kim Bauer on Fox TV’s “24” series) plays Danielle who is a porn star (aka “Athena”), and she stole the entire show by showing off her near-flawless physical features -- even my wife said she looked amazing! But she can act as well, adding some decent depth to the movie, and the chemistry between Danielle and Matthew (Emile Hirch) grew from an innocent boy’s infatuation to self-sacrificing love.<br/><br/>Why did they release a sneak preview three weeks early?  My guess is to help target the female audience.  The male audience is easy to capture here, and the theater had a few singleton males to prove the point.  But there were plenty of females in the audience as well, and men and women alike seemed to laugh at the funny parts.<br/><br/>Direction?  Again, surprisingly good for relative newcomer Luke Greenfield. Production-wise, Girl was good.  If I had to complain about anything it would be the editing – not that film editor Livolsi did a poor technical job (I actually love his works) -- but that the decisions of WHAT to cut got a bit sloppy at toward the end of the film.  Everything was moving along wonderfully…. we’re laughing, laughing, ohh! sexy, laughing, movement, movement… and then there were some dead spots. There were a few scenes that perhaps could have been cut in their entirety without any adverse affect on the plot.  Show ‘em on the Deleted Scenes on the DVD!<br/><br/>While driving back from the theater, I remarked that the movie somehow felt unique but that I couldn't put my finger on it.  My wife said that it had an American Pie-type humor with all of the innocence of the high school boys trying to get some girls.  I thought that the movie was a good erotic-comedy-romance, with a well-deserved R-rating for some drug use and brief nudity (but not of Elisha Cuthbert) and strong sexual content. Here, the term “strong sexual content” is right on because it really couldn’t get much stronger without being an outright NC-17.  Had the sexiest scenes (and there were plenty) had nudity in them, it would have gone way beyond an R rating!  As it was, it was tastefully done but still highly erotic.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

I think<br/><br/>that the most amazing thing about it, though, is the way it makes<br/><br/>you laugh until you cry... but then seconds later... squirm with<br/><br/>discomfort... or even more... with fear for the characters' existence. <br/><br/>This film kept me so off balance that I wasn't sure if we were<br/><br/>approaching its end MANY times over.<br/><br/>It also pushes the envelope as far as sexuality in mainstream<br/><br/>hollywood fare -- not with its visuals -- but with its concepts.  It is as<br/><br/>close as hollywood can come to making a full fledged porn film.  It<br/><br/>does what porn cannot do, though.  (SPOILER) It creates a truly<br/><br/>meaningful sex scene with a pornstar by delaying the pleasure of<br/><br/>actually seeing it until the end of the 2 hours... and it does it in a<br/><br/>way that just destroys porn.<br/><br/>So that said, if you have an open mind, go have yourself some fun<br/><br/>with that girl next door."

","This is your classic high school senior falls in love story, only with a twist...she's a former porn star. While surprsingly amusing and entertaining to watch, the story strays away from the cliche of losing the girl/winning her back, since the whole history of pornography must first be dealt with through often enjoyable experiences that the main character undergoes. The movie was worth seeing if you're in the mood for a light love story with a twist to the classic syntax of high school graduation."

","Just saw The Girl Next Door in a preview screening in Toronto and it's a surprisingly smart and sensitive teen sex comedy. 24's Elisha Cuthbert is beautiful and almost nude but also subtle as Danielle, the ex-porn star who moves in next to Matthew (The Dangerous Life of Altar Boys' Emile Hirsch), a straight-arrow high school senior determined to live it up a little bit now that he's been accepted into Georgetown University. There's enough T&A to keep the frat boys entertained, but The Girl Next Door, despite a couple of lapses in narrative logic, prevails thanks to the enthusiasm of its leads and a remarkably candid approach to sex not mired in heavy-handed moralism, a condition prevalent in these post-Janet Jackson/Boobgate times. Kudos to Timothy Olyphant as Danielle's alternately charming and menacing porn producer."

","The Girl Next Door might be even worse than it looks. By watching the trailor, you think, ""Oh man that looks pretty bad"". Well frankly you have no idea. This flick starts out as a sappy gimmick-romance, turns into some kind of dumb porno-heist, and then eventually ends up as a pretentious slice of the American dream. Puh-leeze. I really want to contact director Luke Greenfeild and tell him that just because you add a whole 2nd plot to your movie, making it seem hours longer than it needs to be, and then in the conclusion play Baba O'Reily while a medley shows how your protagonists end up, that doesn't make your movie a coming-of-age epic.<br/><br/>I guess it hurts worse that it wasn't funny. You can forgive Old School for the mediocrity of its serious side because the film happened to be hilarious. The Girl Next Door--apart from an amusing performance by Timothy Olyphant--is almost completely devoid of any funny material.

But The Girl Next Door utterly lacked substance and intelligence in order to showcase Cuthbert to horny teenagers in the audience. I don't mind the improbable and silly plot if they'd only work on the ridiculous dialogue -- ridiculous even for a lame-brain teen movie. I'll even overlook the nonsensical way Danielle and Matthew developed their affection if they'd just use some neurons in writing the script.<br/><br/>The film was probably written for the sub-14 year old crowd, those who managed to sneak in to this rated R dog of a film.

","This movie was awful. It's an updated version of the 80's Tom Cruise movie ""Risky Business,"" with Porn Star substituted for Prostitute. The characters are flat, at best, and none are believable. The adult film industry is imagined to be this slapstick type business at some times, and gritty and dirty (but not so much that the lead actress is undesirable for having been ridden like Amtrack) <br/><br/>The script writers must have used every predictable clichÃ© in the book. Even the product placement was done poorly. About the only thing positive that can be said this movie did better than the film it so blatantly copied, was to promote safer sex and condom usage, if you're having sex with a high risk partner.<br/><br/>The Unrated Version of this movie is possibly worse than the theater screened version - it features a few extra seconds of T&A, and tons of stuff that was rightfully edited out for the sake of not having the theater audience gouge out their eyeballs."
"TxMike","Null","2","5","21 January 2005"," Cuthbert and Hirsh are fine, but overall a disappointing movie.
","This movie uses a very familiar formula. A somewhat older, daring, and attractive person moves in next door to a high school ""innocent"", and they each help pull the other a bit more towards the middle. Here the innocent is a boy, Matty played by Emile Hirsch, who is smaller than the tough high school boys, who apparently has no girl friends, and is a math whiz who plans to attend Georgetown the next year. Elisha Cuthbert plays Danielle who moves in next door. When Matty finds out that she has no 'boyfriend' he gets interested. However, as we know from the movie trailers, Danielle is a young porn star, a fact that doesn't escape Matty's friend Eli (Chris Marquette, 'Adam' of Joan of Arcadia) for long, because Eli's past time is watching porn.<br/><br/>My favorite character was Kelly, played by Timothy Olyphant. Kelly shows up one day, Matty thinks he might be an old boyfriend, but he really is Danielle's ""producer"". He talks her into going with him to LV for a porn industry show, she goes figuring she can't realistically escape her past. But Matty follows her, fights for her, she eventually leaves the industry for good. <br/><br/>Most SPOILERS are in the following comments. There is a side story of a $25,000 fund Matty was amassing for a young ""genius"" to be allowed to come to America for studies, in a questionable twist Kelly steals the money so Matty has to come up with a quick fund raising scheme. During the school prom he recruits the help of a couple of porn stars and his friends, we the audience thinks he is making a porn movie. In reality he is making a sex-education film, and he sells it for enough to replace the stolen $25,000, a loss he mentally writes off as the price to get Danielle out of her industry.<br/><br/>While the overall story has a positive ring to it, the style of the movie was often in poor taste. For example, the character Eli was obsessed with sex, and his dialog was often inappropriate in public, even in this sort of movie. It just seems that they were too often going for the shock value instead of trusting the inherent goodness of the story.<br/><br/>On an aside, I enjoyed Timothy Bottoms as Matty's dad, Mr. Kidman. He played it very low key, in contrast to the character he played, as the President, in the short-lived TV series, ""That's My Bush."""

It wasn't ""American Pie"" sleazy, but it operates on the same slippery slope.<br/><br/>Danielle says she wants to escape her past, but she dresses like a tart, doesn't object to Kelly's re-entering her life, willingly works a porn convention, has no problem taking Matt to a strip club, and has even less of a problem enlisting her ""friends"" to ""help"" him. If she were really serious about making a fresh start, she'd be working a legit job, call the cops the second Kelly showed up, and dress like a librarian!<br/><br/>Matt's moral compass is even more off! How do you go from resolving to lead a moral life to win a scholarship to deciding the only way you can save the day is by having on-camera sex?<br/><br/>Hirsch looked like an underage Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cuthbert a young Deborah Harry, which made their characters' hook-up downright creepy. It doesn't really matter since they had no chemistry.<br/><br/>Heck, when the most appealing character in a movie is a ""fatherly"" porn king, what does THAT tell you?"

The first half of the movie was OK, in an American Pie sort of way, but the rest was just added on cheese. Every time you think the movie will end, it just keeps ON GOING - like forever! I think I preferred Chris Marquette and Paul Dano's acting than Emile Hirsch's - he just didn't seem in his element. I seriously was just waiting for a Wonder Years voice-over at almost every scene of the movie.<br/><br/>And the imagined scenes were just too complicated and clumsy for this movie...

"johnnyboyz","6","1","2","30 July 2011"," The film is a handsome surprise, albeit with comedy which doesn't always work and stances not hammered home; regardless, it is a hearty and substantial enough piece.
","The Girl Next Door actually makes for a really involving and respectable enough piece, at least it does so right up to the point the lead nabs a peck with that of the titular girl next door. The whole thing might have made for a really smart short; Luke Greenfield striking us as a director able to slot together a telling piece and as a person able to establish; engage; progress and then conclude, with the film loosing rather a bit of energy once everything tanks to that the deserts of Nevada for a lot of running around and the forcing of the lead to having to infiltrate a mansion. Ultimately, the premise of a porn star moving in next door as a kid and his sexist, overly hormonal friends burgeon from school to university rings false; that is to say, the film is in no way the turgid, unholy mess that is worryingly promised when we observe it is about such a thing. Rather, the film takes its idea and decides to put its surprisingly likable young lead through a wringer of anti-social interactions; altercations with dangerous people and through a series of threatening situations which might spiral out of control after having been dragged to places those within feel they are adept to, but in actual fact are punching well above their weights.<br/><br/>The young lead is that of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an individual on the cusp of shifting from one level of the American educational system to the next, that of high-school and on into a somewhat prestigious university to study politics. Kidman is stuck in a proverbial middle-ground of no man's land within the realms of his school's social hierarchy; he is nowhere near that of a hardened jock, as is exemplary in the masses of cock-sure young men and their large automobiles-plus-successes-with-women whom surround his educational zone; but he is additionally, and on account of two frizzy-haired friends of his, several steps up from being labelled of the ""geek"" variety - Matt just existing on a plateau populated by himself as this middling kid, with few distinguishing features nor behavioural patterns. The finale of high school is nearing, and yearbooks are in the process of being filled; our Kidman struggling in that he cannot get words onto paper nor photographs of into albums when challenged with the idea of recording the events and the people that helped form him in his time there. The kid is on the verge of graduation without having faced the ignominy of marginalisation at the hands of the institute's proverbial bullies, nor indeed has he intermingled at the opposite end of the spectrum by garnering success at having captained the school's champion Football team to glory.<br/><br/>The film covers somewhat of an important chapter in Matthew's life as he dares to branch away; dares to push the boat out and get heavily involved in something seemingly way over his head, a general happening brought about by that aforementioned pornography actress. Elisha Cuthbert plays that actress, a woman named Danielle; a woman of slender figure, slinky movement, pouting lips and bright blonde hair, whose moving into the house next door to that of Matt's parents takes very little time for him to notice as such. From these beginnings, an energetic tale is spun out of a young adult with a blossoming persona which could tilt either way, and it is Danielle who goes on to further him down the route of formulating memories; something to write about and pictures of whatever that is required for that part of the yearbook - the joy being in how it sways him towards a mindset more inclined to be nastier and more sordid, before pulling it back and keeping it grounded whilst not falsifying its politics to any alarming extent.<br/><br/>Eventually, that of Timothy Olyphant's pornographer Kelly Simon enters proceedings; the film constructing somewhat of an initially positive and reassuring image of the man before slowly peeling away at the surface and beginning to paint a scummy, abject incarnation of the individual. His arc in this sense runs in tandem with that of his field's representation, which is sort of shown up, as a vacuous; aggressive minefield of maliciousness once everyone has been dragged out to Las Vegas for a Doug Liman's ""Go"" inspired romp so as to escape a proverbial wrath, although appears to recall that the film's target audience may very well be all-too fond of such things and thus, disappointingly restrains said politic from being too damning. Principally, the film is a coming of age; American high-school orientated sex comedy following someone nervous about the sex and with an attitude to the comedy which is strictly grounded and politically straight-and-narrow. The film's presence of a female, specifically that of someone whom specialises in being a star of pornography, is not the flimsy, loose-cannoned and misjudged procession of smut and trash that it might have been; rather, it is about a woman coming into the life of a young man, but being able to have the power to shape and inspire rather than roll over and play dead as an object of one's fantasies. The Girl Next Door is a middling, oft confused piece, but with content to get involved in and characters to get behind: a welcome change for the usual fare of this ilk."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I simply groaned. Why oh why would Elisha Cuthbert put herself in a movie like this after taking part in an awesome program like 24. Well, now I know. As a Deadwood fan, I've been tracing the earlier work of all of its brilliant actors, including Timothy Olyphant. Which brought me back to this movie.<br/><br/>I was far from disappointed. In fact, I really got a kick out of it. Olyphant plays his part spot on--scene stealing as everyone is saying. (I have to imagine the Deadwood casting directors must've seen this performance.) Also, being unfamiliar with Emile Hirsch, I was impressed with his range and realness. Looking forward to more from him. It was good too, to see Elisha in a different kind of role from 24. Her character, though not deeply developed, is an important catalyst for the story... and your heart goes out to her inner sweetness.<br/><br/>Final point. In his commentary, the director mentions that his target demographic was thirty-somethings and younger. That's definitely not me--female 49er. But as long as you're not dead, nor flustered by a degree of sleazy humor, and have some memories of high school, you might very well enjoy this movie. I put it in there with the... ""Yeah, it won't win the major awards, but it makes me smile."" On that note, I've added it to my DVD collection of smallish, fun, heartfelt movies like Happy Texas and Tin Cup."
"The_Void","6","1","2","22 September 2005"," Pornography - still the saviour of high school kids
","Being a big horror fan, I spend a lot of my time watching what you might call 'wayward cinema' but, believe it or not, even the very worst of those films pale in comparison to this little teen flick when it comes to misplaced morality. Here, we have a film that not only shows high school kids in the middle of the porn industry, popping ecstasy pills, stealing things and just generally sticking two fingers up where the law is concerned; but it shows them doing this in a positive light, with a great big smile on it's face! However, I'm not one to complain about such things and, again; believe it or not - this is actually a damn good film! The skewed morality can be off-putting, but it's fairly obvious that this film is meant to be more of a spoof than a serious coming of age tale; so it's better to simply go with it rather than worry too much. The film is in the vein of American Pie, and it follows a young man who is lucky enough to have a porn star move in next door to him. After being caught spying on her undressing, she takes him for a ride and, as you might expect, the two hit it off instantly. However, being a porn star has it's drawbacks, and hers comes in the form of a nasty manager by the name of Kelly.<br/><br/>The plot of The Girl Next Door is entirely predictable, but there's always enough side stories and gags to ensure that the action always remains interesting. The film is never side-splittingly hilarious, but some of the sight gags are genuinely funny. Jokes involving a lap dance, and another that sees two high school kids pretending to be porn directors are the best among them. The soundtrack features a lot of good songs, but it can be annoying when they're being played over nearly every scene. One thing that worried me before seeing this film was Elisha Cuthbert. Like most people, I've been used to seeing her in the best American TV show of all time, 24, and didn't think that she'd be able to pull off the role of pornstar. She's a good-looking actress; but I wouldn't consider her to be 'sexy'. However, surprisingly enough she does really well in the role. Her co-star, Emile Hirsch, looks about ten; but he does a good job of getting the audience on his side, so even though it's impossible to believe that a sexy pornstar would go for him; he doesn't ruin the movie. On the whole, while this isn't anything like a great movie; it's a more than solid entry in the teen comedy sub-genre, and if you want a movie that will entertain for a couple of hours with caring about political correctness - this one should do it."

As a comedy this movie is fun and certainly entertaining, mainly thanks to the well casted actors. Especially Timothy Olyphant is truly great and enjoyable in his 'villainish' porn producer role. Also as a romantic movie, this movie is a really successful one. The love-story is good and mainly, also very original. Basically this movie is a pleasure to watch, from start to finish.<br/><br/>The story has some great turns in twists in it and you never know what is going to happen next. It tries to avoid as many teenage movie cliché's as possible but still unfortunately falls in some traps at times. Still the movie is way better than most other teenage comedies currently being made and some that were made in the '80's, which was the golden age of teenage comedies. This is due to the well written story and characters and the actors that portray them. <br/><br/>The movie is fun and at times also hilarious. It's a very entertaining movie to watch for all ages but mainly for teenagers of course who should be able to recognize some of the elements in this movie. The movie also has some great use of some great music.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","From the commericals I remember on TV, this movie was made out to be another American Pie type of film. But, there is little comedy in it; it is more of a drama. A very hot porn star moves next door for two weeks next to your typical high school senior nerd. He falls for the girl and doesn't learn she's a porn star till his friends show him a tape. She falls for him and realizes she isn't really a slut. Then we have some curves thrown in the plot. Kelly, who Danielle works for, shows up and wants her to make more films. She gets mad at Matt so leaves with Kelly and Matt must convince her to come back. Then other twists include Kelly stealing some money and Matt must come up with a scheme to replace it. Let's just say it involves an almost porn shoot at the senior prom.<br/><br/>It sounds like it would be really funny from a simple plot summary, but the laughs are far between. But there are a few, like when Matt gets a lap dance with his father's friend and Matt on ecstasy.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I thought it would be better than it was. I only recommend it if you are wanting to watch an R rated teen flick."

","Comparison with 80s hit Risky Business is inevitable for this romantic comedy about a high school student dating a porn star.<br/><br/>Innocent A-student Matthew (Emile Hirsh), who is bizarrely both class president and unpopular, is transformed by meeting uberbabe Danielle, the girl next door, played by 24's Elisha Cuthbert. Their path to happiness is interfered with by a variety of characters, including themselves, Matthew's latently gay wannabe filmmaker buddy and Danielle's sleazy former producer slash boyfriend, Kelly. Go's Timothy Oliphant dominates the film with this role  Kelly is simultaneously dangerous, tempting and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Directed by Luke Greenfield (The Animal) and scripted by Stuart Blumberg (Keeping the Faith), The Girl Next Door intersperses saccharine moments (for example, Matthew's botched speech) with cheeky asides, such as Matthew's involuntary porn fantasies. It's no classic but it works, thanks to committed performances from the three leads. Although Cuthbert's role is undemanding, newcomer Emile Hirsch gives good camera as the earnest, yearning Matthew. There's also some cheeky plot twists and the ending is great fun. **½/***** stars."

","'Girl' follows the story of one Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) as he encounters new girl next door Danielle (24's Elisha Cuthbert) and gets involved in her life. Turns out she's a porn star, which Matt's friend Eli (Chris Marquette) lets him in on. So naturally the movie takes several zany twists and turns, from the kids going to Vegas to stalk Danielle at a porn movie convention to Matt getting mixed up with Danielle's dangerous manager, Kelly (Timothy Olyphant). There are enough twists and turns to keep things lively, and enough laughs to entertain most of the time.<br/><br/>Hirsch is effective as Matt; he plays his innocence well, and has enough young boy charm and good looks to win the viewer over. Cuthbert, resembling here a sexier, more beautiful version of a young Debby Harry, is also fairly good, switching back and forth between normal girl and porn star fairly well. Most of the supporting cast is fine; Olyphant is particularly sharp, and I enjoyed Marquette, but that's probably because he reminded me of a smart ass I knew in high school (he even looked like him). In fact, overall, the film is reasonably entertaining.<br/><br/>There's just one catch; you've seen this movie before, and it was called Risky Business. Virtually everything is the same; the hooker is now a porn star, and we're freeing a Vietnamese genius student rather than repairing daddy's Porsche, but in essence the movie is exactly the same, from the young guy falling for a much more experienced partner to the menacing manager (Olyphant was good, but he's no Joe Pants) even to the very way they choose to absolve the main character's debt. The movie follows Risky Business page for page, even closely substituting the obscene catch phrase with one very similar to it. In some respects this film exceeds its source material  Elisha Cuthbert is far better than Rebecca De Mornay, whom I never really thought was any good in the first place  but Hirsch is no Tom Cruise, and in the end, you're just basically getting the same story with some of the rougher edges sanded down told to a new generation. Worth looking at if you don't mind that, but be aware that's exactly what you're getting."

"JamesHitchcock","3","1","3","14 January 2015"," Not So Much ""Risky Business"" as ""Nasty Business""
","Such is the shortage of original material in Hollywood these days that any decent film is likely to be remade, either as an official remake or as a disguised one which plagiarises the plot of its original without acknowledgement. Indeed, even films which were not very good in the first place can be candidates for this treatment. I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone might want to remake the early Tom Cruise vehicle ""Risky Business"", but ""The Girl Next Door"", although not officially a remake, is nevertheless a blatant rip-off of that dull eighties comedy. <br/><br/>Both films deal with an academically promising high school senior who has just been accepted by a prestigious university. (Georgetown here, Princeton in the earlier film). In both cases the boy needs to raise sufficient money to fund his studies. And in both cases he falls in love with a girl slightly older than himself. Now Hollywood is generally uncomfortable with younger man/older woman romances, but even Hollywood scriptwriters have to admit that ""boy, 18, loves girl, 20"" is not such an unusual or anomalous situation as to qualify as the apparently insuperable obstacle which forms a major plot element in most romantic comedies. There has to be something extra to make the young lady unacceptable to bourgeois society.<br/><br/>So in ""Risky Business"" the girl in question becomes a hooker, and here she is a porn star. At first young Matthew, the hero of the film, does not realise what his new girlfriend Danielle does for a living, but when he does he is horrified. Not so horrified, however, that he wants to end the relationship. His troubles start when Danielle, having discovered true love for the first time in her life, decides she wants to give up her career. Her agent and backers in the porn industry, however, see Matthew as a threat to their meal-ticket, meaning that he now finds himself in trouble with them, just as Joel, the hero of ""Risky Business"", found himself in trouble with his girlfriend's pimp.<br/><br/>Trying to remake a good film is a project fraught with difficulty, and trying to remake a bad one, officially or unofficially, is even more problematic. ""The Girl Next Door"" is no improvement on its less than distinguished predecessor. Indeed, in some respects it is even worse. Emile Hirsch, admittedly, makes a more sympathetic hero than did the irritatingly cocksure Tom Cruise as Joel; the cocky, irritating one here is Timothy Olyphant as Danielle's agent and ex-boyfriend Kelly, the equivalent of ""Guido the Killer Pimp"". The pretty but oddly-named Elisha Cuthbert is no substitute for Rebecca de Mornay, one of the few good things about ""Risky Business"". If Ms Cuthbert's parents had been paying more attention in Bible class, incidentally, they might have realised that ""Elisha"" was the name of a male Old Testament prophet. Having a forename which does not match one's gender, however, seems to be no drawback in the cinema. Just ask Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon or Daryl Hannah. Or, for that matter, Mandy Patinkin.<br/><br/>The film was marketed as a teen comedy, but contains so much adult material that it is really only suitable for over-18s. I nearly said ""contains so much adult humour"", but that's just the problem. It doesn't actually contain much humour at all, adult or otherwise. As with a lot of modern so-called comedies, the script was written on the very dubious basis that tastelessness and breaking a few taboos- besides sex there are a few drug references- are an adequate substitute for wit. The final twist in the plot, involving an amateur porno video unexpectedly becoming a hit as a sex education film shown in schools across America, is ludicrous beyond even the normal standards of teen comedies. Not so much ""Risky Business"" as ""Nasty Business"". 3/10"

These script authors obviously never read any studies about the psychological problems of real prostitutes and pornstars, they never talked with real people of this field, and they're very far behind with the reality of today pornography as well. For example, nobody makes much money with a single porn movie in the internet age anymore. Reading any serious article about the today reality in any political or feminist media would have told you much more than this picture about the problem.<br/><br/>Failing on the educational side, the movie isn't entertaining either. It simply lacks real ideas for the story itself, and most attempts to fill the full 90 minutes for a cinema movie look very artificial and don't support any general story. The Hollywood rule 'the story should fit into two sentences' is not followed at all here. I especially disliked it that this movie has not one ending, but about four or so.

Things get complicated when Kelly steals $25,000 that was for a foreign exchange student but with the help from his two best friends (Chris Marquette & Paul Dano) Matthew makes a business deal with a porn king named Hugo Posh (James Remar) where they can raise money making a sex education video for high schoolers.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Luke Greenfield who is making only his second attempt at being at the helm of a film with the first being the Rob Schneider comedy ""The Animal"" and as silly as that is it looks like a masterpiece compared to this idiotic nonsense. A complete blatant ripoff of ""Risky Business"" but without the visual skill and intelligent script that helped make that film a mini classic. There are so many things that are taken from the Tom Cruise film that it would be impossible to list them all but I can point out two with the first being actor Olyphant being the ""Guido the Killer Pimp"" character. The second is the music with the background score being eerily like Tangerine Dream and at one point the hit Muddy Waters song ""Hootchie Cootchie Man"" is played and that was very prominent in the 1983 film. Hirsch is supposed to be 18 years old but he's able to walk into strip joints and porn conventions without ever being asked for ID and practically every adult character is portrayed as innocuous to everything going on around them. With the exception of a few quick shots this film doesn't even have the gumption to have much nudity in it and it's one of the most tame teen sex comedies I've ever seen and I watched the unrated version! Hard to imagine this film has a cleaner version, what would be the point? Every second that Hirsch's character is on screen I kept expecting him to put on some sunglasses and say ""What the F***"" because the screenplay for this is totally devoid of any type of originality. From being funny and intelligent to some sort of exploitation fare this film fails on every level and doesn't seem to have the nerve to try something creative. Avoid at all costs!"

","I couldn't wait for this to come out on video and when it did yesterday I went right out and rented it. I love Elisha from 24 and the idea of her being the porn star next door with a heart of gold sounded too good to be true. Well the movie sucks, and sucks really bad. The opening montage was really good but the second Emile Hircsh stepped on screen it went down hill from there. I though Elisha looked great and did as well as she could but the story was really bad and completely unbelievable, I could forgive that if the movie was funny but it really wasn't except for a few small parts. Emile Hircsh stinks as an actor and I couldn't believe when I started to listen to the commentary that the director said he wouldn't have made the movie without him. First I don't believe that because this is a first time director and he's not going to turn down a job if he can't get a no name actor, and secondly Emile was the worst thing about the movie. I wanted to slap his character so much that when he finally got punched I cheered. I couldn't relate to him at all and I really thought he was a giant douche. I didn't believe the porn star character either, it was badly written and I don't believe for a second that she would fall for any of the mushy stuff like she did. This movie really sucked is one of the biggest disappointments for me this year."
"triple8","3","1","4","11 April 2004"," The movie that wouldn't end.
","Girl next door was an interesting movie choice. I went in not expecting much. For the first half hour or 40 minutes I thought I was wrong. The movie had a heart! It seemed reminiscent of those old style 80's teen comedies I love so much. Risky business, as others have mentioned, a little sixteen candles etc etc. So I relaxed and began to get into the movie. Unfortunately, I was wrong yet again.<br/><br/>This movie-correction-the MAJORITY of this movie wasn't good. If they could have made this movie with just the first 40 minutes and the last 5 or so, they'd have a keeper, but the middle just torpedoed the whole thing. Here is why. And yes:there will be some SPOILERS:<br/><br/>The movie becomes preposterous-violent, corny, not funny and TEDIOUS. It becomes the movie that will not end. There are exhausting tiresome twists thrown in virtually every five minutes that did nothing for me except give me a headache I did not want.<br/><br/>This had the potential to be great. It started promisingly enough. Danielle and Matt have lots of chemistry-she brings out his wild side-it's fun and breezy. But the movie just throws to many unfunny pointless curb balls and quickly becomes less a comedy then a wanna be boogie nights-teen style. And it doesn't work. It loses its focus and becomes more then mediocre, just bad. So many scenes are thrown in that are obviously just fillers. They don't need to be there and are not funny-just pointless.<br/><br/>We were very disappointed in girl next door-we actually almost walked out at 1 point but the movie was winding up at that point anyway. Although, as mentioned there WERE parts that were good, the movie skimmed over the good parts while highlighting the stupid ones.<br/><br/>Kelly should NOT have morphed into A thug-he should have stayed funny if a bit slick. He was great up until the kidnapping scene which was just dumb.<br/><br/>There should have been more scenes of Danielle and Mathew falling in love-such great chemistry! such under use of ALL that chemistry!<br/><br/>The movie should have wound up at least 20 minutes before it did-maybe more.<br/><br/>The end was ridiculous-how did Kelley even know they had MADE that tape? Tedious-and maybe the movie should have wound up with the whole scholarship dinner.<br/><br/>In closing-I'd give this 3 out of 10-though the beginning and last few minutes gets an 8 and the soundtrack gets an easy 10. This is not, the worst movie I've ever seen at all-(although pretty bad)-but it wasn't anything near what it could have been."

","Now I'm not a pervert or nothing, but usually when a movie is rated R it goes for the throat.  If I had to give this simply average movie a rating, I'd give it ""half R"", meaning that half the movie had guts and the other half had none.  I believe the movie was written by a schizophrenic (however you spell it).  Some days, he would be raunchy and uninhibited.  He used the great premise to his advantage.  And some days, he was a big wussy.  He wimped out and made chessy scenes seen in hundreds of other movies (c'mon pal, I saw an ecstacy trip in BAD BOYS II).<br/><br/>Tim Olyphant was the best character, but he dried out near the end.  Elisha Cuthbert was sexy.  The Tripod (as they're called in the film) were good, too.  I just wish this film would've stayed in one direction, you know? First, the girl next door's a former porn star.  Great!  Wait, now it's about friendship.  Okay, but... porn star?  Yes?  No?  Yeah, ex-porn star and friendship.  WHAT?  Kid from the Orient?

It's about a teenage boy and a young porn star and they fall in love each other, but her job is a huge problem and he's trying to help her get out of this.<br/><br/>Okay, I don't really understand how could someone think of this storyline. Its plot is so random, that unfortunately, can't really write a review.<br/><br/>Again, there's a high schooler, that wants to give scholarship to a really genius poor boy, so the school collect some money. Then, the same boy, falls in love with his neighbour, a young porn star by watching her getting undressed. Of course he belongs to a nerd squad and she's out of his league and he's a virgin, but OF COURSE, she falls for him back. The problem is her job and her silly manager. Our protagonist tries really hard to help her getting out of this, but her manager is money-freak, so it's not easy and then we have a non-pormographic amateur film about the value of protection.<br/><br/>See? Is there any point of this film? For me, certainly not! I can't rate it higher. It really gave me nothing.<br/><br/>Protection is really important, scholarships are also, but their presentation is very prosaic. And I don't mean that it should have been a drama, because of these topics, but a comedy with smarter script and storyline.<br/><br/>I paused it many times for really no reason. I started watching it at 15:00, but I finished it at 19:00.

They at least dealt with sex and innuendo in a cheerful manner, whereas here everything is so sleazy and devoid of any fun.<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs.<br/><br/>PS: Elisha Cuthbert, the chick playing the title role, became semi-known on a Canadian show 'Popular Mechanics for Kids' where she played a smart goody-two-shoes with all the answers, but in taking this role she became a victim of some terrible career advice.<br/><br/>Perhaps the thinking was that she's certainly hot enough physically to join the likes of Lindsay Lohan, Hillary Duff, Olson twins and other Hollywood jail baits being worshiped by teenyboppers and middle-aged pervs the world over - and no quarrel there - however, instead of being catapulted into their echelon she will, likely forever, be banished down to the Elizabeth Berkley territory.

I try'll to think about them as a couple, but that's not all! I'll dreaming about to have this relationship by myself. Not because she's hot or dirty or something. More or less their connection and how they both are for each other, like they are as one person. It feels so good and so complete. I know as everybody else it's just a movie. <br/><br/>But seriously .. I can't get enough of them(especially where we see them hanging out a lot and where it is more about them as a couple) and wish the film was much longer,only because of their relationship to each other. - I want their relationship!! Its so truly and perfect. <br/><br/>Is there any of you? who has the same feeling about this movie? I like the concept and their small jokes. But what's really takes my attention is their relationship between each other. Its so real and so great. They are truly their both soul-mates in this movie. I love especially that the relationship is not all about ""the man who would do anything for the girl"" but also that Danielle is helpful and gives all for her ""new younger man/boyfriend"" in her life. They give everything for each other. Its not like all other Romantic films, where the man are fighting the girl back. Its mutual emotions and help from both.<br/><br/>I want this film/romantic show as my own.

I would have loved it more with a few more laughs and a story not entirely focused on two people madly in love and then painfully split up and then getting back together and all that. The cast was great, watching this movie after watching Into the wild really put my focus on Emile and i came to realize why he remained popular and re-cast as he is a pretty good actor. His love interest, played by Elisha is also a great cast- but so is the rest of the crew. Soundtrack fits perfectly into the scenes and is well done.

"roberts-journalist","3","0","3","23 January 2013"," Rotten to its core
","Let me start by saying that I've never seen a movie so shameful and morally compromised as ""The Girl Next Door"" in my life.<br/><br/>To make a good teen-comedy about a sensible subject - such as the wild hormones of American teens - , you must detach yourself from everything that might be perceived as vulgar or rude or nasty and come up with some ""sweetnes"" to make the movie more innocent and honest in they eyes of the public. That's one thing this rookie, Luke Greenfield (who had previously directed the dumb feature called ""The Animal"", with Rob Scheider as lead actor), did not understand. <br/><br/>Even a teen-comedy has to be more than just girls, tits, sex and porn-stars. I'd like to think that there is a deeper meaning hidden somewhere between those f-words. But, never mind that! I can live with the fact that this movie simply doesn't care to educate people. However, I can't and won't tolerate it's limited moral horizons. Because this so-called ""mild & sweet teen comedy"" deliberately delivers potentially harmful messages to its audience. And does that time and time again.<br/><br/>Imagine that a cute teenager with porn-star backgrounds is portrayed in this movie like a dream-girl (true, there is nothing cooler than having a girlfriend who f...s other guys for a living). An Asian student (or geek) from Cambodgia is presented as a sex object (lots and lots of references to sodomy). And there is more. We are made to believe that the adult films industry is not that bad as you'd might think (strangely, the parents even applaud their son, Matthew, for making a porn film, because ""this could really sell""). And let's not forget the biggest boss in the porn world, a guy named Hugo Posh (James Remar), who's actually a good person once you get to know him. Is it just me, or there is something missing here? Since when do we promote porn in teen-comedies?<br/><br/>All in all, if you want some nasty jokes, some tits and some crude remarks, then you'll get your share with this movie. But if you want wit and style, avoid it. Because, even with pretty decent acting from Emille Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert (this girl has sex appeal all right!) and the talented Timothy Olyphant (you may know him from HBO's TV Series Deadwood), The Girl Next Door is one big fat lie."

"StevePulaski","7","0","1","28 July 2011"," Your inconsistency is showing
","I had to contemplate long and hard what grade I would give this movie. It was teetering on the edge of recommendation, when ultimately, a few little things docked it down to a state where I can't really recommend it. With that being said, I will say that The Girl Next Door did however keep me entertained for all one hundred and ten minutes because of its very vibrant casting and quite a few jokes that were actually funny that weren't seen in the trailer.<br/><br/>Speaking of the trailer, it is another film that pretty much covers up parts of the plot to draw more of an audience. The same thing happened in the trailer for Dream a Little Dream where the big part about the body swapping element was left without a mention. In the trailer for this film, it tries to make this look like a teen comedy following in the footsteps of the American Pie franchise. When really, it is more of an adult raunchy comedy.<br/><br/>The plot: Matthew (Hirsch) is a high school Senoir stressing over his big speech he is set to give on the topic ""moral fiber,"" which may get him a scholarship to the prestigious Georgetown University. Looking back on his High School experience when asked what he'll remember, Matthew tries hard to recollect what he will remember but can't find anything.<br/><br/>Matthew is in luck because he gets a new neighbor. Her name is Danielle (Cuthbert) and she is probably every guy's masturbatory fantasy come true. Matthew is in his room and notices her changing clothes and can't help but stare. Seeing him, Danielle comes over to introduce herself of all things instead of tell Matt's parents he was snooping.<br/><br/>They hang out frequently, developing an awkward yet likable friendship until Matt's friend Eli (Marquette) informs him that she was a porn star under the stage name ""Athena."" Matt is shocked, and in disbelief, and soon enough, he meets the cut throat producer of Danielle's named Kelly (Olyphant) who means business. Kelly and Matt form a very unsettling relationship, and his life begins to spiral out of control between the love of his life and the consequences.<br/><br/>The story does have a good motto and moral that is probably one of my favorites next to the meaningful bit in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. In that film, a guy in prison tells Harold that ""there is no sense getting all riled up every time a bunch of idiots give you a hard time, (because) the universe tends to unfold as it should."" In this, Kelly firmly tells Matthew to ask himself ""is the juice worth the squeeze?"" meaning is Danielle worth the possible consequences. Because of what Matthew tells Danielle in the movie at an adult convention, she declines Kelly's offer and goes back home.<br/><br/>While bringing good actors and a good motto into the light, the film also has a number of inconsistencies that I found. One of them is age seems to mean nothing in this film. There's one scene where Kelly and Danielle take Matt to a strip club. Keep in mind, Matthew is in high school and is no older than eighteen or nineteen. How did he manage to get into the strip club? Same thing with the adult convention. How did the three friends get into the convention when they're only Senoirs in high school? Also, why is Danielle going to an adult convention as ""Athena"" when she is a ""former"" porn star? Wouldn't that mean she quit doing it, and usually when you quit something, you don't make public appearances as the job you quit. In order for this movie to exist, many things also can't. Like age and occupation rules.<br/><br/>Those things really drag the film down, along with the fact the film does nothing but glorify the world of porn. Not one women in this film, except for Matt's mom (Bullock), is not put in this film to show of their body. I find it a little odd that we see such a world of porn stars and personality lacking women in a film that tries to have a strong motto. While the film packs on a good motto, it doesn't do much to eliminate stereotypes.<br/><br/>But for some reason, this film still stood out to me for the music, the performances, and the overall feel. Obviously, the poster child for this type of genre is Risky Business. If I would've seen the full movie, I probably would've found this less in quality. But standing on its own, it really does get laughs despite a few inexcusable inconsistencies. It's a respectable, yet not strong enough Hollywood debut by actor Emile Hirsch, who I still believe will go on and do some brilliant things in his lifetime.<br/><br/>Starring: Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, Timothy Olyphant, Paul Dano, Chris Marquette, Timothy Bottoms, and Donna Bullock.

Comedies can get away with being impossible for sure, but this film starts out rather strait forward, and then progressively defies common sense without adding any real humour or wit to justify it. Everynow and then, I did find myself laughing, (out loud even) but these moments are too few and far between in a rather lame screenplay, which doesn't amount to much.<br/><br/>Another problem is the lack of character. I wanted to care for the two love birds that the movie is supposed to be about, but their romance is highly unbelievable and turns out to be the last of the film's interests. We spend more time with characters that really don't have any major importance, and the film's attempts to make them important don't work. <br/><br/>So much happens in the film, that about one hour in, you'd think it's about to collapse. Actually The climax is the best part. It is here where the humour is at its best (although that still doesn't say enough) and then in the last five minutes, things get sour again, in the form of a piece of s**t ending which is arguably the most idiotic part, and is totally unsatisfactory. <br/><br/>Director Luke Greenfield is so desperate to shock and surprise his audience over the course of ninety plus minutes, that he seems to have forgotten the most important ingredients of the film. The Girl Next Door is bone dry of charm and intelligence, and it's sense of humour is inconsistent and also insufficent. I'll have to say skip this film."

","Though not a complete disaster, The Girl Next Door doesn't come close to reaching the status of that 1983 classic it so often tries to imitate. With this film, we have a lot of ideas and an uneven tone that just cannot be formed into a truly worthwhile experience. Some scenes are clearly inspired by the Tom Cruise vehicle of yesteryear, and other ideas seem to have wandered in from such films as Weird Science, or even Something Wild. Though filled with sleazy situations and characters, in the end the film seems to fancy itself as some kind of nostalgic feel-good movie about the most memorable thing about high school for the lead character.<br/><br/>Emile Hirsch, a likable kid, stars as Matthew Kidmann. He's an intelligent kid just about to wrap up a successful senior year of high school. All he is focused on is winning a scholarship to pay for his education at a prestigious university. (Harvard? I forget where) Of course his world is turned on its head when a beautiful young woman moves in next door and causes him to make some very bad decisions. Sound like a familiar plot? Making matters worse is the fact that the girl is a porn star, which is a fact his friends soon point out. And her smarmy producer/boyfriend doesn't like this high school kid trying to get his woman out of such a lucrative business. Still sound familiar? It should. Lots of plot complications ensue and the kid is forced to make what we are led to believe is a porno film to raise a bunch of money he lost that would have allowed an exchange student to come to America from Asia.<br/><br/>The film probably fails more than anything due to the fact it isn't that funny. There are some laughs here and there, but it doesn't measure up to more raunchy teen films of the day. Lots of stereotypical characters in most scenes. Is it just California high schools where the popular kids pile into convertibles and ride around acting like their lives are the greatest as the less-popular kids sigh when they drive past? Never seen that around my neck of the woods. Here they use pick up trucks. Another big problem is this film's lack of conviction regarding the world of pornography. Lots of talk about sex, but very little nudity. Even in the unrated version. No compelling love scenes here like there were in Risky Business. And the twist ending regarding the film these people make during their prom is more of a cop-out than anything. The film does have a good soundtrack, and Elisha Cuthbert is a welcome sight in every scene. Nice try, but watch Risky Business instead. 5 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

She must have had 5 or 6 new clothes new make-ups new hair styles, that was a little anoyng to say at least, i felt it was on fast forward. Emille Hirsch acted great too, not that he had much of a hard work to do. He played a crazy in-loved teenager, nothing mor as for Tymothy Olyphant, he was the most genuinely as Kelly, Danielle's manager.<br/><br/>The plot was filled with cliché's, the same old jokes, smae old ending were everyone succeeded in everything. Not one scent of a drama, not one serious problem. I mean, come on, thinks can't go that smoothely in real life!

"HelloTexas11","4","0","2","5 July 2008"," pretty cheesy teen sex flick
","'Risky Business' may develop a reputation like that of 'Easy Rider'- a good film that people come to wish had never been made because of all the cheesy imitations it spawned. Exhibit 273- 'The Girl Next Door,' yet another adolescent sex fantasy masquerading as a 'coming of age' film or something similarly high-minded. What are the ingredients? First, a teenage boy's wet dream come true, a drop-dead beautiful girl who takes an interest in him for no apparent good reason. In this case, she's an ex-porn star who moves in next door. Uh huh. Mix in the usual group of geeks, nerds, bullies and situations requiring a prurient spin on almost everything, the requisite wild parties and car rides, the late night dips in someone else's swimming pool and sexual escapades at the senior prom... you know the drill. 'The Girl Next Door' has a few ideas of its own, but not many good ones. The film thinks that by quickly disowning what are essentially soft-core porn scenes and suggestions by having one character or another disapprove of them, it's perfectly justified in showing them in the first place. This is the equivalent of showing a bunch of teenagers a skin flick and then saying, ""that's what you shouldn't do."" As though that's the lesson they'll draw from it. Elisha Cuthbert plays the title character, Danielle; in appearance, she's sort of a cross between Debbie Harry and Cameron Diaz. Emile Hirsch is the teenager in question. They both give likable enough performances, considering the circumstances, but they are dragged through teen-flick cliché after teen-flick cliché. The initial attraction, the misunderstanding, the falling out... the scenes where she tells him to just leave her alone, the reconciliation. Strictly paint-by-the-numbers stuff. And actually, while Cuthbert is on screen a lot, she doesn't have much to do in the second half. At least it seems that way. Maybe she just doesn't have anything interesting to do. The less said about the supporting players, the better, except one character type I am REALLY getting tired of, and that's the wise-ass best friend who acts as though he knows the ways of the world and is always offering inane advice. If nothing else, it all makes you realize how well-made a film 'Risky Business' was. But that movie had a real script, and two real actors- Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay. There was a fair amount of titillation in 'Risky Business' too. I would say the distinction between it and what we see in 'The Girl Next Door' is fairly obvious. To be fair, 'The Girl Next Door' isn't the worst of these kind of flicks. There are some funny bits here and there; Timothy Olyphant as a Fonzie-ish porn producer almost succeeds in making his a real character, and has some funny lines. But to say this film doesn't quite rank with the dregs of teen sex comedies is definitely damning it with faint praise."

Also, the main characters are not developed enough, especially the girl herself, who becomes a comedy sidekick as the film goes on. <br/><br/>But on the upside the thing that makes this film worth watching is miss Cuthbert looking beautiful as always.

"Hunky Stud","7","0","1","14 March 2007"," where are the Asians?
","I was not going to write a comment, but I was just thinking how come I didn't see any Asians in this film? I started to notice about this phenomena ever since I saw the film ""Minority report"" which did not have any Asian actors in them.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen an Asian male jock in any of the Hollywood high school or college movies? I don't think that there is one. There maybe some Asian girls as the popular students, but I have never seen any Asian males in any leading characters in any high school or college movies.<br/><br/>That guy Sannang reminds me of the Asian character in ""Breakfast at Tifannys"" which was very racially offensive to all Asians. Even though Sannang is supposed to be very smart, but look at him, he talks like an idiot, and he looks funny. The whole high school was laughing at him when his video was shown. The director chose to make him a ""smart"" student, that did not reduce his true intent which is to make fun of this Asian in degrading ways. That is very wrong. If he chose an African student to make fun of, would the blacks tolerate such a thing? I don't think so. If he wants to make fun of Asians, at least he should have hired another Asian actor for a positive role. Asians should not be silent again, we should not just take it for granted that Asians should be invisible in Hollywood movies! <br/><br/>In this film, all the jocks are white, the protagonist and his two friends are also white. The teachers are also white. The only Asian female actor was a porn star in this movie. The high school is supposed to be somewhere outside of Los Angeles. Asian students can be found in almost all California high schools, how can it be possible that in that particular high school, there was no Asian students? It doesn't make sense that those ""jocks"" were willing to make a video with those porn stars. And when Kelly wants to have a private talk with Matthew at the end, where did the principal go? How did Matthew become the president of the student body if he is not even popular? How can Kelly get a whole bottle of Ectasy drug directly from the glove compartment, what if he the police stops him one day and search his car? And his parents were OK to let him to go out with that girl late at night even though they just met?"

","There were times throughout this movie that I really wanted to slit my wrists. The story is choppy and inconsistent which is only noticed b/c of its lack of humor. The storyline had potential and I really wanted to like it, but in the end (which is long and drawn out btw), I just couldn't appreciate. It definitely had some good moments and Cutberth is extremely beautiful and gives a great performance throughout but that's not enough to recommend a movie. Olyphant's character was too inconsistent and wasted on his talents but he does steal just about every scene he's in. The ending is long, drawn out and really stupid and I believe every scene has some kind of song for the situation. Without giving anything away, I believe this movie could've ended 30mins. earlier at the prom without all the other stuff to worry about. It just simply became too much of a comedy of errors (in both the story and the writing) and just when you thought (or hoped in my case) that it was over...here we go again with another annoying problem. They could have done so much with this (like focused more on Cutberth's character) but focused too much on being a teen flick instead of a good movie. Cutberth's and Olyphant's talents are wasted and I can't even recommend this to teens.

Huh? It would've been a whole lot better if they kept the GIRL involved. What kind of romantic comedy loses track of one of the love interests for 20 minutes?

He's terribly envious of all the popular kids in school who seem to be having the time of their lives. Howver, he's so out of their league that he really is quite pathetic.<br/><br/>Enter Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) the new girl next door.

When at a party and one of the jocks begins hitting on Danielle, Matt finally makes his move and kisses Danielle. Looks like the kid has some balls after all! Good job Matt.<br/><br/>Matt eventually finds out that Danielle is a washed up porn star, and she has moved in next door to start a new life as a clean and wholesome girl. That is until her ex boyfriend and manager Kelly (Timothy Olyphant)strolls into town to haul her off to the annual Las Vegas porn connection.<br/><br/>After Matt blows Danielles cover and makes her feel like the tramp she once was, she decides to high tail it with Kelly. Matt is completely whipped over her by this point and begs her not to go -but als, she bails anyways.<br/><br/>Matts balls have gotten pretty big by now, and he takes off to rescue her from the clutches of her evil pimp. Eventually after Danielle returns home- Kelly comes back with a vengeance for Matt - causing him to lose the school funding he has been working on to bring a foreign exchange student to his school. He also manages to slip him some Ecstatsy - on the very night he has to give a speech in an attempt to gain the scholarship to college that he has worked so hard for.<br/><br/>Nerds and porn stars eventually come together to hatch a plan to raise the money once again - this time by making their own porno right at their very own school.<br/><br/>""The Girl Next Door"" is the kind of movie I would have enjoyed a lot more as a teenager than as an adult. Now grown up- you realize how far from reality this kind of stuff is--but as a kid- this would have been a fantasy flick that I would have killed to see come true.<br/><br/>Overall stupid but enjoyable.<br/><br/>Recommended for all you nerdy/horny teens with big dreams and not much else......."

Like that film, it's heavy on the good clean fun, with just a touch of titillation, while staying far away from anything risqué. If that's what you're looking for, this film is worth checking out. Performances here are all-around solid, with Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert obviously drawing most of the attention. Fortunately, the supporting cast is also strong, with Timothy Olyphant providing just the right blend of sleaze and bonhomie, at times threatening to steal the show completely. Is this as good as the gold standard, Risky Business? No, not really. It stretches the limits of credibility at times, and it has a couple of awkward, draggy moments.

"ed_metal_head","8","0","1","7 April 2005"," Fizzles after an excellent first hour.
","A teenaged romantic comedy with a twist, The Girl Next Door has more than just a little of Risky Business in it.<br/><br/>Matthew (Emile Hirsh) is a senior in high school. Academically an overachiever and president of the Student Council, Matthew's greatest wish is to attend Georgetown. Without the financial means to do so, Matthew's only hope lies in winning a scholarship. Matthew, however, struggles with an empty feeling due to his lack of popularity and thus romance. When the beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door for a short stay, she turns Matthew's world upside down.<br/><br/>This movie works mostly because of the performances of Mr. Hirsh and Ms. Cuthbert. While the two do not do any great acting, their on screen presence and general charisma make them a joy to watch. It is perhaps, not a surprise then that the film suffers when Ms. Cuthbert is reduced to a trophy girlfriend after actually having a role in the movie. Timothy Olyphant (as Kelly the porn producer) steals the show with a delightful performance in a supporting role.<br/><br/>The Director (Luke Greenfield) also deserves credit, mostly for the first hour, for keeping this film from being another teen movie. Besides some nice camera shots, he allows the movie to build at a nice pace and perfectly captures the feeling of the characters, especially in uncomfortable social situations.<br/><br/>The plot for the movie is quite uneven. After such a brilliant first hour, the movie fades quickly to the point of ludicrousness before improving slightly for the end. For instance, no scene in the film is better than when the characters are at a house party and Matthew is in an uncomfortable situation. It is so well expressed that one can easily see the 'fight or flight' impulse that he faces. On the other hand, the worst scene in the movie involves a character, high on ecstasy and showing it, giving a terrible speech on 'moral fibre' and receiving a standing ovation. A further vexing moment occurred late in the movie, when a boom microphone is clearly visible at the top of the screen for several seconds. This sort of mistake from a Hollywood release is unacceptable.<br/><br/>In the end, I have decided to recommend The Girl Next Door based solely on its opening hour. In that first hour, the film captures high school life as perfectly as I have ever seen on cinema.

","Clearly a lot of research went into this 'ambitious' teen movie, as it packed in more unnecessary plot twists than a whole series of 90210.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's just nostalgia, but I remember with fondness the teen movies such as 'Risky Business' or 'Can't Buy Me Love', where the premise (although equally simply - loser/lifeless guy needs some lovin') dominates the movie, instead of becoming secondary. In 'The Girl Next Door', the fact that the delicious girl is a porn star is the premise - not the plot. It's not a 'oh my god, she's a porn star!' it's a 'hey, look and see what wacky hijinks can come out of this!'. How does a porn star girlfriend help you solve your everyday teen problems? Potentially entertaining, but less than incredible.<br/><br/>As an alternate, I would actually suggest the unheralded 'The New Guy', which takes an equally ridiculous premise, but renders it in a much more coherent, episodic fashion.<br/><br/>Not, mind you, that this movie is a total loss (6/10). The supporting cast are great (especially the porn producer) and, good lord, she is yummy. A great soundtrack rounds it out nicely.

I don't 'remember' any of them, but I'm pretty sure there were. Other than those few jokes, everything else was just braindead.<br/><br/>For a subject that's largely portioned much more gloomy and dark, I at least give this film credit for making a semi-serious comedy out of it. It's unfortunate that they 'tried' to maintain a level of gloominess and darkness, because that was probably the worst part about this film. Had they simply made a straight-forward comedy, I might've enjoyed more (more Elisha Cuthbert would've also worked).<br/><br/>The 'evil guy', whose name I don't remember but could easily check using this website I'm on though I'm too lazy to, was a great character nonetheless.

","In one of the scenes that pretends to be funny in this film the main male character is punished to run naked after the car drove by the main female character. 'It's not funny' he complains. 'It's a little bit funny' she answers. Talking about the film, he is the one to be right!<br/><br/>'The Girl Next Door' is an unpleasant mix of teenage comedy, moralizing story and social comment about the porn industry. It takes a good director to mix these themes in a good film, and this movie did not get one. The script bares much guilt as it is never comic enough, sharp enough, crazy enough or credible enough to have the viewer path the threshold of 'so what'?'. Acting does not help either. We never get to care about the characters, they do not succeed to make us love or hate them. I liked Elisha Cuthberg in '24' - one of the best series of the latest years in American TV - but she does not hold the capabilities or she did not enjoy the hand of a good director to turn the role into something to remember. All male teen actors are directed in a way that makes them look unfit for life and screen. The better acted parts are the two supporting roles of the porn moguls, but this is not enough.<br/><br/>'Euro-Trip' proved this year that there is a chance for the teenage comedy genre. With 'Girl Next Door' we are back to the moralistic view of the world. Trying to sell the 'human side' of the pornography world in a teenage comedy with 'moral fiber' (another quote from the film) takes much more talent. This film lacks it. 4 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","It wasn't long before and after the release of ""The Girl Next Door"" that the inevitable comparisons to the teen sex comedies of yesteryear began.

It's not as clever as the 1983 comedy starring Tom Cruise, but it's more daring in its exploits than ""American Pie.""<br/><br/>""Risky Business"" was released in 1983 amidst a blossoming season of raunchy teen movies (and so was ""The Girl Next Door"") and both films featured a young man (Tom Cruise then, Emile Hirsch here) who are on their way to bright futures but get caught up in the mess they've made following a brief walk on the wild side.  Their stepping into the wild side is initiated by a chance meeting with a beautiful girl who captures their hearts (Rebecca De Mornay then, Elisha Cuthbert here).<br/><br/>It is right then that the differences first begin to appear.  Back in good old 1983, when Tom Cruise was just becoming the heartthrob that he is today in 2004, he was a more picturesque definition of a ladies man - being that he had charisma, confidence and sex appeal.  Fast forward to 2004, with rising actor Emile Hirsch, who is more of a flake, definitely less attractive than someone like Tom Cruise, and therefore that makes Hirsch easier to relate to.<br/><br/>""The Girl Next Door"" is more daring than ""American Pie"" in its delivery of the raunch.  Guys have dreamed for ages about meeting the ""girl next door,"" who is played perfectly by ""24"" star Elisha Cuthbert and who most definitely looks like the woman of some lonely guy's sex fantasies.  But the thing is, she's a porn star, as Hirsch finds out; this is where ""Pie"" is surpassed. In ""Pie,"" the most a man could do was just dream about being in the same room as Shannon Elizabeth and not screwing up; consequently, that's about as far as poor Jim (Jason Biggs) got in that movie.<br/><br/>Did I like ""The Girl Next Door"" when I saw it for the first time on DVD today?

","The Girl Next Door has some potential at the onset, but that quickly faded after the first 30 minutes or so.

My main argument is that Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) makes such stupid decisions throughout the movie that I found myself not caring anymore about him or about what he was trying to do.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>First of all, his decision to take Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) to a cheap motel, get her drunk and then have sex with her just because he found out she used to be a porn star completely goes against what his character is supposed to be about.  I thought he cared about this girl?  I thought he was falling in love with her?<br/><br/>Secondly, the way he just goes along with Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) when he drags him out of school is simply ridiculous.  Matthew knew this guy was dangerous, so why just get in the car and go who-knows-where with him?  He had the protection of being in school.  He could have used that to his advantage.  Back when I was in high school, it wasn't that easy for a student to get abducted right from the middle of a class, for heaven's sake! What kind of teacher just allows some disheveled older male to snatch a kid right from his desk??<br/><br/>Thirdly, after Kelly punches Matthew in the car, he gives him some pills for the ""swelling"" that he just caused him.  Give me a break.  What idiot just takes some white pill given to him by some unstable moron?  He could have given him rat poison for goodness sake.  He should consider himself lucky that is was only Ecstasy.  This guy is supposed to be the school president that is up for a prestigious scholarship.  I figured this meant he had some brains in his head.  I guess not.<br/><br/>There are other scenes in this movie that demonstrate complete stupidity as well, like the second scene in the bank where Matthew finds out that all the money has been withdrawn illegally by Kelly.  What kind of bank makes a mistake like that?  I wouldn't want to keep my money there!  Also, there is much more due process that would have taken effect in the bank as soon as this HUGE error was discovered.<br/><br/>On the good side, the film starts out promising (as I said earlier) and the chemistry between Matthew and Danielle worked well.  That should have been explored a whole lot more.  Elisha Cuthbert looked stunning and has real screen presence.  Let's hope her next movie has more believable characters around her and a better script."

Besides that, The Girl Next Door is your typical story about ""the girl next door"" that every guy wants. This storyline has been reproduced many times.

","While kind-hearted and absent of any major flaws, 'The Girl Next Door' doesn't take any chances or break any significant new ground.  It's content has been covered ad nauseum in countless other teen comedies.  So what it becomes is a vehicle for a rising star (Elisha Cuthbert) and for a few wannabees (the boys - one looks, acts, and sounds like a young John Cusack), and for a few has-beens (Timothy Bottoms and Timothy Olyphant).  So it's pretty much a gawk-and-drool fest for the ""it girl"".  The plot has a few holes, unlikely twists, and takes one major loop too many on it's way to the movie's end, and it adds minutes to film that should have been cut.
