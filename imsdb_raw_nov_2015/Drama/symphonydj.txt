INT: HOSPITAL HALLWAYS - DAY

A man, John Corigliano, walks through a calm hospital hallway. He reaches a visitor station and signs his name on the visitor sheet. A bold, dark, "Corigliano, J 2:41am".
JOHN
(to the nurse at the station)
Thank you

He is wearing nice shoes and dress pants. He moves quickly. People in the hallway make way for him. There is a chorus of EKG beeps and as he walks the loudest beep becomes solid.
Someone  has  flatlined.

It is now shown that he is carrying a violin case at his side. He heads toward the room at the end of the hall. When he reaches the door he knocks but it moves open with his touch.

INT: HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The tone of the EKG is louder when the door opens. There is a fragile man in bed, covers pulled up to his chest and a man at his bedside, holding his hand, gaunt as well. The partner of the dead man looks up at John confused.

John sets the violin case down on a side table and takes out the violin.

He moves to the bed and sets the violin and bow on the dead mans chest.


Now play.

Play what?
JOHN PARTNER
The bow slides off the dead man's chest and hits the floor. John goes around the bed to pick it up and unplugs the EKG. The piercing tone stops.
PARTNER (CONT'D)
Play what?
JOHN
(he becomes more animated) Not you. Now play!

The violin begins sliding off the dead man's chest. It is all there is to see.
The moment between false hope and splintering wood. The dead mans hand catches it by the neck before it hits the floor. He pulls it to his chin and opens his eyes. John hands him the bow.

JOHN (CONT'D)
(more gently) Now, play.

The dead man, Davis, begins to play. A long, scratchy tone. He breath out a ragged breath. He tries again. It is long and smooth and is broken by a sob from his lover, Anders.
Davis stops playing and wipes a tear from Anders' cheek.
DAVIS
(softly and smiling)
Don't cry love, I'm not finished yet.

Davis sets up the instrument, breaths out, and plays his starting note again, then the next note, then falls into an intuitive melody. It's as if he has done it a million times before.

INT: DINER - EVENING

Sheldon and John are sitting at a booth across from each other. The diner is not very full. It is somewhat dim, illuminated by neon open signs.
JOHN
What did your students say?
SHELDON
They were quiet. Then they asked when I got it.
JOHN
Could you tell them?
SHELDON
If I even knew I would tell you John.

JOHN
I know.

The waitress brings John an Omelet with fries and Sheldon black coffee and toast.
SHELDON
(to the waitress) Thank you

SHELDON (CONT'D)
I think some of them were scared of me. They think I'll spread it probably.

JOHN
They were scared for you.
SHELDON
Maybe. They didn't even ask if I was a hemophiliac. They knew.
JOHN
They're scared to lose you, Sheldon. They want to know how much longer they'll have you for.
SHELDON
Wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to get rid of me.
JOHN
You can't think like that. You're a genius and you know it. Being sick. Being gay does not change that.
SHELDON
(laughing)
They don't want me gone because I'm gay, John. They want me gone because I'm the bastard that makes them play scales for hours. They'd kill me themselves if given the chance.

JOHN
Shut the hell up.
SHELDON
(leaning forward) Now A-minor scale, again.
JOHN
Fuck you
SHELDON
(smiling)
No, your form is shit. Again.
Sheldon raises his hands up, feigning a conductor.

Bastard
JOHN

SHELDON
And look at your wrists.
JOHN
Look at your wrists
SHELDON
Ha, what about them?
JOHN
Limp
SHELDON
Fuck you too.

Sheldon bites from his toast and grimaces. He isn't as hungry as he though.

JOHN
Eat, I'm taking you out tonight.
SHELDON
Oh, really.
JOHN
I'm not letting you cry yourself to sleep.

SHELDON
Men don't cry.
JOHN
You're barely a man. You're a monster.


Oh really.
SHELDON

JOHN
Let me take you out one last time before you're slain like the beast you are.


Hmm
SHELDON

JOHN
I don't blame them for wanting you dead.
SHELDON
I'm having trouble deciding whether I'd rather die by the hands of a friend or by the kiss of an enemy.
JOHN
Which am I?
SHELDON
Still  deciding.
JOHN
Well, I think you're going to live forever.

SHELDON
I wish I was going to live forever, then I wouldn't have to be so hard on them now.
JOHN
You're not going anywhere.
SHELDON
I just want them to be great.
JOHN
They're gonna be great regardless.
SHELDON
I'm letting them down.
JOHN
You don't owe them your life.
SHELDON
I owe them whatever's left of it.
JOHN
How about we just live whatever's left of it?
SHELDON
That's a lot to ask of me.
JOHN
Ok, then lets just start with tonight.
John shovels the last bites of egg into his mouth. He puts a
$20 on the table and pulls Sheldon up by the hand to leave. Sheldon takes his coffee cup and downs the rest, placing it on the counter on his way out.
EXT: CITY STREETS - NIGHT

After exiting the diner John leads Sheldon down the sidewalk turning down side streets and back onto main streets. Neon lights glaze their eyes. John reaches into his jacket for a flask and hands it back to Sheldon. Sheldon takes a swig and grimaces.

SHELDON
That took a year off of my life.
JOHN
Bullshit. That's imported.
SHELDON
I don't have a year left to spare. You can give me shit like this to drink.

JOHN
Liquor won't kill you Sheldon, I will.

SHELDON
I want to see you try bastard.


The men arrive at the piano bar. John opens the door for Sheldon and they step in.

INT. PIANO BAR - NIGHT

The bar is dimly lit with low light and candles on the two person tables. The men take a seat at the bar.
JOHN
(to the bartender)
A shot for the end of the world
SHELDON
Make it two.
BARTENDER
Sure thing
SHELDON
The end of the world?
JOHN
Look around.
The establishment is emptier than usual. The piano sits empty and the patrons throughout the room sit alone.
SHELDON
It's not the end of the world, John. It's just a Tuesday.

The bartender pours their shots and gets back to work on other customers. John takes his shot and sighs.
SHELDON (CONT'D)
You're not gonna wait for me?
JOHN
(smiling)
Maybe on the next one.
Sheldon takes his shot and coughs a bit.
SHELDON
You're trying to kill me.
JOHN
I saw an actual dead man play the violin today.
SHELDON
Yeah sure. And what did he play?
JOHN
Something we had been working on together.

SHELDON
Dead men don't play violin.
JOHN
I don't know Sheldon. As good as dead. Dead. What's the difference?
Sheldon waves the bartender over.
SHELDON
Another round please.
John leans his head back and sighs.
SHELDON (CONT'D)
Am I as good as dead?
JOHN
No. It was different. He was -
SHELDON
Fragile? Pale? Distorted?
JOHN
He was so thin Sheldon.
SHELDON
I'm thin.

But you-

JOHN

The bartender has poured them the two new shots. John stands up to take the shot.

JOHN (CONT'D)
(grimacing)
you're gonna live forever

John slams his glass on the counter and pulls Sheldon to his feet and to the piano.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You're gonna live forever and I'm going to prove it.

Sheldon takes a seat at the piano bench and places his shot glass on the glossy lid. John stands in front of the piano, on the raised platform facing the pathetic crowd. He takes the microphone and taps it.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Good evening gentlemen. I am so very excited to announce, for one night and one night only, tonight's resident piano man, Sheldon Shkolnick.

Sheldon stands to bow from the waist then takes his shot before sitting down. He cracks his fingers and winks at the crowd that is now moving towards seats closer to the piano. Everyone has heard Sheldon play before. He relaxes his shoulders and melts into playing Tango by Isaac Alb√©niz.

The spirit in the room lifts and it is no longer solemn. One of the servers brings out a tall glass to a customer near the piano and John takes the servers hand and spins him. The other patrons join in the revelry. John smiles at his best friend. The music is like magic.
INT: JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

Jack Romann, 56, sits in a rocking chair. He is in a well furnished sitting room. He hums the melody of the Tango and moves his fingers along his shakey legs. He's wrapped in a blanket. There is a knock on the door.
JACK
Come in
John enters the sitting room from the front door.
JACK (CONT'D)
Oh, John. Come in, come in, come in. What's the occasion?
Jack begins to stand up.
JACK (CONT'D)
Can I get you anything?
JOHN
Hello Jack. It's so, so great to see you.
John goes to hug Jack.
JOHN (CONT'D)
No occasion. It's just been, too long. Entirely too long.
After the hug, Jack gestures toward the kitchen.
JACK
Yes, entirely too long! Now can I get you anything? Wine? Orange juice? Tea?
JOHN
I take a coffee.
JACK
Ah yes, a coffee. Perfect.
The move to the kitchen.

INT: JACK'S KITCHEN - DAY
JACK
What have you been up to John?
JOHN
I've been working on something big. I'm not sure about it yet.
JACK
What's there not to be sure about.

Jack moves through the kitchen. Opening cabinet after cabinet looking for a mug.

JOHN
I don't know if what I'm doing is right. Morally.
JACK
You'd have to tell me what you're doing.

Jack goes to the pantry to get the coffee and closes some cabinets by swinging his thin hips. John is leaning on the counter. Jack puts water and ground coffee in the machine and turns to face his friend.
JOHN
I think I'm writing a symphony.
JACK
You said you'd never write a symphony.

JOHN
I never thought the world was going to end like this.
Jack pulls a teaspoon out of the drawer.
JACK
Cream and sugar?
JOHN
Yes please.

Jack pulls the salt from the spice cabinet and the cream from the refrigerator. He places them on the center counter.
JACK
The world is not ending darling. You're being reborn. Composer-in- residence at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It rolls off the tongue. Like sweat cream in black coffee.
Jack spins around and pulls the fresh coffee pot out. He pours while he talking. With no mug underneath, the hot coffee splashes and spreads along the countertop.
JACK (CONT'D)
Sure, I'm afraid too but life-
JOHN
Jack!
Jack notices his mistake and stops pouring.
JACK
Shit
JOHN
Let me get a-
JACK
No, I got it.

Jack uses a close by towel to wipe up the still steaming coffee. He gets the mug and pours the rest of the coffee in for John.

JACK (CONT'D)
Fuck.

Jack slides the mug across the counter to his friend.
JACK (CONT'D)
Coffee with cream and sugar.

John notices that the substance in front of him is salt instead of sugar. He pours in just the cream while Jack pours his own mug of coffee.
JOHN
Thank you
JACK
You shouldn't think about it like the end of the world John.
JOHN
I'm not ready to lose him.
JACK
You don't have to.
JOHN
I'm not ready to lose you either.
JACK
I think you already are.

Jack has his elbow on the counter, his legs are getting tired already.

JOHN
You're still here, Jack.

John reaches across the counter to hold Jack's cheek. Jack picks up the salt that he put out earlier. He acknowledges his other mistake. He turns to reenter the sitting room.

INT: JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
JACK
(sighing) I'm barely here.

Jack sits back down on his piano bench, facing outwards, towards his friend.

JOHN
Tell me what you did yesterday.
JACK
What?
JOHN
Can you tell me what you did yesterday?

JACK
Are you quizzing me, John?
JOHN
On what?
JACK
You want to see how crazy I've gotten already. Would you believe me if I told you I remember what I ate for breakfast today?

Jack turns to face the piano and runs his fingers over the keys. He feels weak.

JOHN
I don't care what you ate for breakfast, Jack.
JACK
Fine, yesterday I woke up. I had cereal and coffee with cream and fucking sugar. And went to work. Where I ran my company. And I went home. And the train stopped for a bit in the tunnel. But I got home in time to watch Jeopardy. And then I poured myself a drink.

Jack softly fingers the jeopardy theme and watches John's eyes. John pulls up a stool and sits down to face him, smiling

JOHN
Always Jeopardy. And how much did you win?

JACK
$6,400. But remember those winnings are taxed.

JOHN
You only get them if you win.
JACK
I got second.
JOHN
That's pretty good for some guy watching the TV.
JACK
I suppose
JOHN
And I suppose you're not gone. You're still here. I'm not losing you. You're not losing yourself.
JACK
You're lying.
JOHN
I have no reason to lie.
JACK
To protect my feelings.
JOHN
If you were descending into madness I would use the opportunity to beat you at jeopardy. But you're here, still winning.
JACK
I got second.
JOHN
I would've been third.
JACK
You wouldn't have qualified.
JOHN
You're an ass
JACK
A smart-ass

Jack turns around on his piano bench and leans back against the keys. He's feigning drama.
JACK (CONT'D)
So tell me about this symphony.
John smiles, he's glad his friend remembers.
JOHN
It started with...well Sheldon, I keep telling Sheldon he's not gone yet. I'm telling you now too, that you're not gone yet.
JACK
And we're not.
JOHN
You're not. Gone yet. But I keep telling Sheldon that he's going to live forever. Either I'll gather up the sense to kill the bastard myself or he's going to live forever. But I don't know how much longer I can believe it Jack.
JACK
Why are you asking for so much?
JOHN
Isn't it the least we deserve? To be able to kiss until we're old. Then longer. I think we should get to live forever. We've only lived half lives anyway. Half hating ourselves and half free.
JACK
Well John, if Sheldon's anything like me, he might already feel like he's lived a million lives.
JOHN
Well he doesn't.
JACK
Is he ok?
JOHN
He's getting worse.
JACK
We're all getting worse.
JOHN
Everything's getting worse.

Jack leans forward and puts his hands on his knees. He feels the corduroy, grounding himself. He looks up at his friend.
JACK
Tell me about your symphony.
JOHN
It's just pieces. Pieces of I don't even know what.
JACK
Hmm
JOHN
It's just pieces...of people's pieces. Pieces of people. It's muck.

JACK
Pieces of people...why isn't that enough.

JOHN
It has no thread. And all of this kind of feels like theft. I never meant to write a symphony and here I am.

JACK
Here you are. So why are you here?

Jack turns around to face the piano. He begins softly. An Italian Tarentella. A dance that descends into madness.
JOHN
Because I know how good you are at things like this and I am missing something?


Like what?
JACK

JOHN
It would be a lot easier to find it if I knew.

JACK
Well, hurry up John. I'm not going to live forever.

Jack is grinning, hammering out his notes. Staccato and precise. The music crescendos through they conversation and they raise their voices over it. John is becoming increasingly desperate. Jack is becoming increasingly deranged.

JOHN
Don't say that.
JACK
It's true.
JOHN
I'm missing a thread.
JACK
For your button?

Jack gestures to a button missing on the center of John's jacket. His other hand is still playing.
JOHN
For my symphony. I need some thread to tie nothing into something.
JACK
Well you need to work faster, right? You need to weave your thread before the end of the world right?

JOHN
It wouldn't be so hard if you'd stayed longer to help me. You always figure out the little things. I just need you to stay for now ok?
Jack stops playing and looks John dead in the eyes.
JACK
Ok? Make me.

INT: JACK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING

John is at the piano in the dark. His hands are on the keys, placed on the last notes of his Tarentella. He has gotten Jack's help. Or was it just pieces of Jack, speaking to him. He is narrowing down the thread.

John stands from the piano and walks to the telephone. A beige machine with a spiral cord tangled in itself. He dials a number and waits. Next to the phone is a framed photograph of John's funeral program. Death date May 5th, 1987.
GIULIO
Hello
JOHN
Hello, yes Giulio.
GIULIO
John, you're lucky I answered. I was just about to-
JOHN
I believe I've figured it out.
GIULIO
Figured what out.
JOHN
The symphony.
GIULIO
Ah yes, how is that going.
JOHN
It's pieces Giulio. Which at first was frustrating. It is like slivers of people. But then Jack helped me-
GIULIO
Jack?

Yes
JOHN GIULIO
Jack Romann?

Yes
JOHN

GIULIO
Where are you now?
JOHN
Jack's apartment.
GIULIO
How did you get in at this hour?
JOHN
His sister gave me a key. She knows how I like to play his baby grand.
GIULIO
I see. And you've made a breakthrough?
JOHN
I think so.
GIULIO
That's wonderful.
JOHN
Giulio you know I love you.
GIULIO
Ahhh, don't get sentimental.
JOHN
Sentiments are all I have my friend. And that's the key.
GIULIO
The key?
JOHN
The thread!
GIULIO
The thread of what?
JOHN
The symphony. I've been sitting in the dark. Wracking my brain, trying to create something that matters for an audience. Something that isn't a some conceited display of my skills.
GIULIO
You're allowed to be an artist John.

JOHN
What is an artist without his muses?


A genius.
GIULIO

JOHN
An egoist, Giulio. How can I write as the world is ending, and be an egoist?

GIULIO
You're world is not ending. You're losing people. And it is sad. And I'm scared of dying. I wake up every day I hope that I dreamt it.
JOHN
Who would I be to ignore that? I'd be exactly like the rest of the god damn world. Of course I could draw together pieces of the great classics and pervert the conventions to create something new but normal.
GIULIO
You're allowed to be normal.
JOHN
Now is not the time for normal. Jack is gone.
GIULIO
I know you cared about him a lot but you can just do your job. Be a composer in residence. Be famous. It's ok. It's incredible even.
JOHN
It's not ok.
GIULIO
Do you know how many guys can say he's college friends with a rockstar?

JOHN
I'm no rockstar.
GIULIO
